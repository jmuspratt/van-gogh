    <p>Letter W23 <sup>1</sup><br>
     Auvers-sur-Oise, c. 12 June 1890</p>

    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p>I am adding to my letter to Mother <sup>2</sup> a few
    words to you.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday I had a visit from Theo and his family; I find it
    very pleasant to be less far away from them. These days I
    am working a good deal and quickly ; by doing this I
    seek to find an expression for the desperately swift passage
    of things in modern life.</p>

    <p>Yesterday in the rain I painted <art id=0760>a large landscape</art>, showing
    fields as far as one can see, looked at from a height,
    different kinds of green growth, a potato field of a somber
    green, between the regular beds the rich violet
    earth, on one side a field of peas in white bloom, then a
    field of clover with pink flowers and the little figure of a
    mower, a field of long and ripe grass somewhat reddish in tone,
    then various kinds of wheat, poplars, on the horizon a last
    line of blue hills, along the foot of which a train is passing,
    leaving behind it an immense trail of white smoke over all the
    green vegetation. A white road crosses the canvas. On the
    road a little carriage, and white houses with harshly red roofs
    by the side of this road.</p>

    <p>A fine drizzle streaks the whole with blue and grey
    lines.</p>

    <p>There is <art id=0762>another landscape</art> with vines and meadows in the
    foreground, and behind them the roofs of the village.</p>

    <p>And another one with nothing but <art id=0804>a green field of wheat</art>,
    stretching away to a white country house, surrounded by a white
    wall with a single tree.</p>

    <p>I painted <art id=0753>a portrait of M. Gachet</art> with an expression of
    melancholy, which would seem to look like a
    grimace to many who saw the canvas. And yet it is necessary to
    paint it like this, for otherwise one could not get an idea of
    the extent to which, in comparison with the calmness of the old
    portraits, there is expression in our modern heads, and passion
    and like a waiting for things as well as a scream. Sad and yet
    gentle, but clear and intelligent - this is how one ought to
    paint many portraits.</p>

    <p>At times this might make a certain impression on people.
    There are modern heads which people will go on looking at for a
    long time to come, and which probably they will mourn over
    after a hundred years. Knowing what I know now, if I were ten
    years younger, with what ambition I should work at this! Under
    the present circumstances I cannot do very much for I do not
    hold intercourse with, nor should I know how to hold
    intercourse with, the people I want to influence.</p>

    <p>I sincerely hope to be able to paint your portrait
    someday.</p>

    <p>I am very anxious to have another letter from you, I hope to
    see you soon, I embrace you in thought.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
