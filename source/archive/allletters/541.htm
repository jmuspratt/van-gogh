  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I know quite well that I already wrote you yesterday,
    but it has been such a lovely day again today. My great regret
    is that you cannot see what I am seeing here.</p>

    <p>Since seven o'clock this morning I have been sitting in
    front of something which after all is no great matter, a
    ball-shaped bush of cedar or cypress, planted in the grass. You
    already know this ball-shaped bush, since you already have <art id=0428>a study of
    the garden</art>. Enclosed also <art id=1465>a sketch</art> of my canvas, again a square
    size 30.[Painting lost]</p>

    <p>The bush is green, a little bronze and various
    other tints.</p>

    <p>The grass is very, very green, lemon-tinted emerald green.</p>
    <p>The sky is very, very blue.</p>

    <p>The row of bushes in the background are all oleanders,
    raving mad; the blasted plants flowering so riotously they
    could certainly catch locomotor ataxia. They are loaded with fresh
    flowers, and heaps of faded flowers as well, their
    greenery is likewise renewing itself in vigorous new shoots,
    apparently inexhaustibly.</p>

    <p>A funereal cypress, all black, is standing over them, and some colourful
    little figures walking on a pink path.</p>

    <p>This makes a pendant to <art id=0468>another size 30 canvas of the same
    place, only from quite another point of view, where the whole
    garden is coloured in very different green, under a pale lemon-
    yellow sky.</art></p>

    <p>But isn't it true that this garden has a strange character
    which makes one easily imagine the poets of the
    Renaissance, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, strolling among these
    bushes and over the flowering grass?<label content="art.technique"> Now it is true that I have left
    out some trees, but those I kept in the composition are
    really there just as you see it.</p>

    <p>Only it has been overcrowded by some bushes which are not in character.</label></p>

    <p>And this should find that truer and more fundamental character.
    This is the third time that I've painted the same place.</p>

    <p>It just happens to be the garden right in front of my house.</p>

    <p>But this corner of garden is a good example of what I was
    telling you, that to get at the real character of things here, it is
    necessary to study them and paint them for a very long time.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you will see nothing in the sketch except that the
    lines are now very simple. This picture is again painted very
    thickly, like its pendant with the yellow sky.</p>

    <p>I hope to work again with Milliet tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Today again from seven o'clock in the morning till six in
    the evening I worked without budging except to grab a bite just
    two steps away. That is why the work is going so quickly.</p>

    <p>But what will you say of it, and what shall I think of it
    myself, a little while from now?</p>

    <p>I have a lover's lucidity or blindness for work
    just now.</p>

    <p>Because the setting of colours all about me are new to me, and it gives
    me an extraordinary exaltation.</p>

    <p>I have no thought of fatigue, I could even do another painting
    this evening, and I would bring it off.</p>

    <p>If I tell you that it is very urgent for me to have:</p>

    <p>6 large tubes of chrome yellow, 1 lemon yellow</p>

    <p>6 &ldquo; &ldquo; veronese green</p>

    <p>3 &ldquo; &ldquo; Prussian blue</p>

    <p>10 &ldquo; &ldquo; zinc white</p>

    <p>Big tubes like the zinc and silver white</p>

    <p>Then this can be deducted from yesterday's order</p>

    <p>At the same time 5 meters of canvas</p>

    <p>I can't help it, I feel so lucid, and I want as far
    as possible to make sure I have enough pictures to hold my own when
    the others are making a great effort for the year '89. Seurat
    with 2 or 3 of his enormous canvases has enough to hold an
    exhibition of his own, Signac is a good worker and has enough
    as well. Gauguin and Guillaumin too. So for the time being, whether we exhibit
    or not, I want to have the series of studies:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <BIG><i>Decoration</i></BIG><br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>In this way we shall be absolutely original, for the others
    will not be able to think us pretentious when we have only
    that.</p>

    <p>But you may be quite sure that I shall try to put
    <i>style</i> into them. Today Milliet was pleased with what I
    had done - <art id=0574>the ploughed field</art> - generally he does
    not like what I do, but because the clods of
    earth are as soft in colour as a pair of sabots, it did not offend him,
    with the forget-me-not blue sky flecked with white clouds.
    It would give me great pleasure if he posed better,
    and he would have <art id=0473>a more elegant portrait than I
    can manage now, though the subject is beautiful with his pale and matte
    tinted face, the kepi red against a viridian
    background.</art> </p>

    <p>Ah, how I wish you could see all that I am seeing these days. In front of so
    many lovely things I can only let myself go. Especially since I think that
    the work is getting somewhat better than the last batch. Only
    it was the studies in the last batch that prepared me to be able to
    work with so much assurance, these days that are free of
    wind.</p>

    <p>Why doesn't our good father Thomas want to lend me anything on
    my studies? He is making a mistake if he doesn't, and I hope he
    will. I am afraid of overburdening you, and yet I would like to
    order some 200 franc's worth of paints, and canvas, and
    brushes. It is not for anything else, it is for that.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the entire autumn will be fine, and if I knock off a size 30 canvas every
    two or three days, I shall make several thousand franc notes.</p>

    <p>I still have a kind of concentrated power, more than I need to
    spend just on the work. But I am bound to begin by using up a heap
    of paint, and that is why I need Thomas.</p>

    <p>If I continue to work like this, I shall have my
    studio full of very sound studies the way Guillaumin's is.
    Guillaumin is sure to have some beautiful new things I don't doubt,
    and I would love to see them.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">The present studies  are really done with one coat of impasto.</p>

    <p>The touch is not much divided and the tones are often
    blended, and altogether I can't help laying it on thick &agrave;
    la Monticelli.</label> Sometimes I think I really am continuing
    that man's work, only I have not yet done the figure of a lover
    as he did.</p>

    <p>And probably I shall not do it either before doing some serious studies
    from life. But there is no rush, and now I am quite
    set in my mind to work hard until I have surmounted that.</p>

    <p>If I want to get this letter off, I must hurry.</p>

    <p>Have you news of Gauguin? At any moment I am expecting Bernard's
     letter which will probably follow the sketches.</p>

     <p>Gauguin must certainly have another combination in mind, I have felt that for weeks
    and weeks.</p>

    <p>He has a perfect right to, of course.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.loneliness">For the moment the solitude doesn't bother me, and later
    we will find someone for company, and perhaps in the end more than
    we want.</label></p>

    <p>I believe it is not necessary to say anything unpleasant to Gauguin if he
    does change his mind, and take it absolutely in good part.</p>

    <p>If he has joined forces with Laval, it is only natural, since Laval
    is his pupil, and they have already lived together.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, if they might really both come here, we could find
    some way of putting them up.</p>

    <p>As for the furnishings, if I knew beforehand that
    Gauguin was not coming, I still would like to
    have two beds in case I had to put someone up. So of course he
    is quite free. There will always be someone with the desire to
    see the Midi. What has Vignon done?? After all, if everything
    takes a turn for the better, everyone will be sure to make
    great progress, and the same for me too. If you can't always see these lovely days
    here, you will see some of it in the paintings. And I am trying to
    get more into them than in the others.</p>

    <p>A handshake and</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
