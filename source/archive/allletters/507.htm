  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter, for the 50-franc note and <label content="art.materials">the
    package of Tasset's paints and canvases which has just arrived.
    He has put in his bill, which comes to 50.85 fr., so that I
    have been able to check his prices and compare them with
    &Eacute;douard's. They are considerably lower than
    &Eacute;douard's, so that with the 20% discount, we have
    nothing to complain of. As for his canvas at 4.50 fr., I shall
    probably now be able to find out the manufacturer's price per
    piece.</label></p>

    <p>Your letter brings great news, namely that Gauguin agrees to
    our plan. Certainly the best thing would be for him to come
    rushing here at once. Instead of getting out of a mess, he will
    probably get into one if he goes to Paris first.</p>

    <p>Perhaps he might make a deal with the pictures he will be
    bringing along with him, which would be great luck. Herewith
    the reply.</p>

    <p>I only want to say this, that not only am I enthusiastic
    about painting in the South, but equally so about the North,
    <label content="health.general">because I am in better health than six months ago.</label> So that if
    it is wiser to go to Brittany, where you get board and lodging
    so cheaply - from the point of view of expense I am certainly
    ready to come back to the North. But it would be good for him
    too to come to the Midi, especially as it will already be
    winter in the North in four months.<label content="business.co-op"> And it seems so certain to
    me that two people doing precisely the same work ought, if
    circumstances prevent them spending more, to be able to live at
    home on bread, wine, and anything in short that you'd want to
    add.</label> The difficulty is eating at home <i>alone</i>.<label content="food-and-drink.preference"> The
    restaurants here are expensive because everybody eats at
    home.</label></p>

    <p>Certainly the Picards and the Leonardo da Vinci too are not
    less beautiful because they are few, and on the other hand the
    Montcellis, the Daumiers, the Corots, the Daubignys and the
    Millets are not ugly because in so many cases they have been
    painted with very great rapidity and because there are
    relatively a good many of them. As for landscapes, I begin to
    find that some done more rapidly than ever are the best of what
    I do. For instance, <art id=0412>the one</art> I sent you the cartoon of, <art id=1484>the
    harvest</art>, and <art id=0425>the stacks</art> too. <label content="art.technique">It is true that I have to retouch
    the <i>whole</i> to adjust the brushwork a bit, and to make the
    touch harmonious, but all the essential work was done in a
    single long sitting, and I change them as little as possible
    when I'm retouching.</label></p>

    <p><label content="health.fatigue">But when I come home after a spell like that, I assure you
    my head is so tired that if that kind of work keeps recurring,
    as it has done since this harvest began, I become hopelessly
    absent-minded and incapable of heaps of ordinary things.</label></p>

    <p>It is at times like these that the prospect of not being
    alone is not disagreeable.</p>

    <p>And very often indeed I think of that excellent painter
    Monticelli - who they said was such a drinker, and off his head
    - when I come back myself from the mental labour of balancing
    the six essential colours, red - blue - yellow - orange - lilac
    - green. Sheer work and calculation, with one's mind strained
    to the utmost, like an actor on the stage in a difficult part,
    with a hundred things to think of at once in a single half
    hour.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.alcohol">After that, the only thing to bring ease and distraction, in
    my case and other people's too, is to stun oneself with a lot
    of drinking or heavy smoking.</label> Not very virtuous, no doubt, but
    it's to return to the subject of Monticelli. I'd like to see a
    drunkard in front of a canvas or on the boards. It is too gross
    a lie, all the Roquette woman's malicious, Jesuitical slanders
    about Monticelli.</p>

    <p>Monticelli, the logical colourist, able to pursue the most
    complicated calculations, subdivided according to the scales of
    tones that he was balancing, certainly over-strained his brain
    at this work, just as Delacroix did, and Richard Wagner.</p>

    <p>And if perhaps he did drink, it was because he - and
    Jongkind too - having a stronger constitution than Delacroix,
    and more physical ailments (Delacroix was better off), well, if
    they hadn't drunk - I for one am inclined to believe - their
    nerves would have rebelled, and played them other tricks: Jules
    and Edmond de Goncourt said the very same thing, word for word
    - &ldquo;We used to smoke very strong tobacco to stupefy
    ourselves&rdquo; in the furnace of creation.</p>

    <p>Don't think that I would maintain a feverish condition
    artificially, but understand that I am in the midst of a
    complicated calculation long <i>beforehand</i>. So now, when
    anyone says that such and such is done too quickly, you can
    reply that they have looked at it too quickly. Apart from that
    I am now busy going over all my canvases a bit before sending
    them to you. But during the harvest my work was not any easier
    than what the peasants who were actually harvesting were doing.
    Far from complaining of it, it is just at these times in
    artistic life, even though it is not the real one, that I feel
    almost as happy as I could be in the ideal, in that real
    life.</p>

    <p>If all goes well, and Gauguin sees fit to join us, we could
    put the thing on a firmer footing by suggesting he put
    <i>all</i> his pictures together with mine, and share profit
    and loss. But either that will not happen, or it will happen of
    itself, according to whether he thinks my painting good or bad,
    and also according to whether or not we co-operate.</p>

    <p>Now I must write to Russell and I am going to urge him to
    make an exchange with me. I must work hard to try to sell
    something on my part to help with the expenses, but we must be
    of good heart in spite of the difficulties, and working as we
    are to safeguard the artists' life, it will fire our blood.</p>

    <p>A handshake, I'll write again soon. I'm going into the
    Camargue for two or three days to make some drawings there. I
    am glad that you are sending for our sister.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I'll write Mourier one of these days, <i>you will read the
    letter</i>, you will see how I will talk to him - I can see the
    picture from here!!! the head like a Delaroche.</p>

    <p>Have patience with M. a little longer. Perhaps he is going
    through a crisis.</p>
