  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Even before receiving (this very moment) your kind letter, I
    had had a letter this morning from your fianc&eacute;e
    announcing the engagement. So I have already sent her my
    sincere congratulations in reply, and herewith I repeat them to
    you.</p>

    <p>My fear that my indisposition might prevent you from making
    that very necessary journey which I had so much and so long
    hoped for, now that this fear has disappeared, I feel myself
    quite normal again.</p>

    <p>This morning I was again at the hospital to get another
    dressing, and I walked for an hour and a half with the house
    surgeon, and we talked a bit about everything, even about
    natural history.</p>

    <p>What you tell me about Gauguin gives me tremendous pleasure,
    that is to say that he has not given up his project of
    returning to the tropics. That is the right road for him. I
    think I see light in his plan, and I approve of it heartily.
    Naturally I regret it, but you understand that provided all
    goes well with him, that is all I want.</p>

    <p>If you can, get to talk a little to C. M. about the future
    of his business, and whethter his son will be able to keep it
    going as long as C. M. himself has; he should even make it his duty
    to listen to you. And C. M., together with his son, should try to
    keep the house founded by him going - didn't he introduce into Holland
    all the artists who were not with the Goupil's etc., etc?</p>

    <p>Then Tersteeg must admit the impressionists, or at least believe
    in Eug. Delacroix, and then Tersteeg and you would give yourselves
    a very strong hand which Boussod would have to count on.</p>

    <p>What is the `89 Exhibition going to be? Don't forget the
    <art id=anatless>&ldquo;Anatomy Lesson&rdquo; for M. Rey</art>. He had already told me
    before this morning that he was fond of painting, though he
    knew nothing about it, and that he wished to learn. I told him
    he ought to turn <i>collector</i>, but that he should not try
    to paint himself. That means that perhaps we shall find two
    friends in the doctors here, Rey and the Paris doctor, of whom
    I have spoken before.</p>

    <p>I told them that Brias of Montpellier had a certain family
    likeness to <i>us</i>, and that therefore we were only
    continuing in the South what Monticelli and Brias began.</p>

    <p>I have had to pay quite a number of things on leaving the
    hospital, and though I am in no sort of a hurry for several
    days, it would be nice if you could send me 50 francs or so
    within the next few days.</p>

    <p>I think the mistake in old Gauguin's calculations was that
    he is rather too much in the habit of ignoring the inevitable
    expenses of house rent, charwoman, and a lot of worldly things
    of the kind. Now all those things are weighing more on
    <i>our</i> shoulders, but once we have accepted them, other
    artists could stay with me without having those expenses.</p>

    <p>They have just told me that during my absence the owner of
    my house here made an arrangement with a fellow who has a
    tobacco shop to turn me out and give this tobacconist the
    house.</p>

    <p>This has rather upset me, for I am not much disposed to have
    myself turned out of this house practically in disgrace when it
    was I who had it repainted inside and out, and had gas put in,
    etc. - in fact, who had made habitable a house which had been
    shut up and uninhabited for a considerable time, and which I
    took in a very poor condition. This is to warn you that perhaps
    at Easter, if the owner persists, I shall ask your advice about
    it, and that in all this I only consider myself a
    representative defending the interest of our artist friends.
    Besides, between now and then it is more than likely that a
    good deal of water will have gone under the bridge.</p>

    <p>And the great thing is not to worry about it. Has Bernard
    given you back Silvestre's book? I shall need the exact title
    to make the doctors in question read the book.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">Physically I am well, the wound is healing very well and the
    great loss of blood is being made up,</label><label content="health.gastrointestinal"> because I eat and digest
    well</label>. <label content="psychology.insomnia">What is <i>to be feared</i> most is insomnia,
    and the doctor has not spoken about it to me, nor have I spoken of it
    to him either. But I am fighting it myself.</p>

    <p>I fight this insomnia by a very, very strong dose of camphor
    in my pillow and mattress, and if ever you can't sleep, I
    recommend this to you. I was very much afraid of sleeping alone
    in the house, and I have been afraid I should not be able to
    sleep. But that is quite over and I dare to think that it will
    not reappear. My suffering from this in the hospital was
    frightful and yet through it all, even when I was so far gone
    that it was more than a swoon,</label> I can tell you as a curiosity
    that I kept on thinking about Degas. Gauguin and I had been
    talking about Degas before, and I had pointed out to Gauguin
    that Degas had said &hellip;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am saving myself up for the Arl&eacute;siennes.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Now you know how subtle Degas is, so when you get back to
    Paris, just tell Degas that I admit that up to the present I
    have been powerless to paint the women of Arles as anything but
    poisonous, and that he must not believe Gauguin if Gauguin
    speaks well of my work too early, for it has only been a sick
    man's so far.</p>

    <p>Now if I recover, I must <i>begin again</i>, and I shall not
    again reach the heights to which sickness partially led me.</p>

    <p>I should have liked very much to give another picture to
    Rivet, just because I quite agree with you that it would be
    well to put M. Rey in touch with Rivet.</p>

    <p>But you could quite well tell Rivet that it would be a good
    thing to send M. Rey back here to the hospital with the
    doctor's degree he is trying to get.</p>

    <p>He is very, very useful here and they will be desperately in
    need of a doctor here at Arles in the time to come, with
    cholera and the plague, etc., continuing so threatening in the
    region of Marseilles. Now Rey was born here, and would be no
    use in Paris or elsewhere, whereas once furnished with the full
    medical authority of Paris, he would do real miracles here in a
    time of calamity.</p>

    <p>Certainly we have no right to meddle in medical affairs.
    Only Rivet himself will perhaps be of the same opinion, at any
    rate in so far as an Arlesien is not a Parisian and vice
    versa.</p>

    <p>Did you stop at Breda? Naturally I am inclined to think so.
    Reassure mother especially with regard to me.</p>

    <p>Have you seen <art id=0476>the portrait of me which Gauguin has</art>, and have you seen
    the portrait which Gauguin did of himself during those last few days?</p>

    <p>If you compare the self- portrait Gauguin did then with <art id=auguinsp>the
    one that I still have of him, which he sent me from Brittany in
    exchange for mine</art>, you will see that on the whole he himself
    got rested here.</p>

    <p>What has become of Haan and Isa&auml;cson? I did hope
    vaguely to see them here one day if Gauguin had stayed longer
    with me, and with this in mind I had even taken two little
    rooms which were going to be vacant in the house, which I am
    now occupying completely (the rent is 21.50 a month). I dare
    not urge this any more, seeing that Gauguin has gone, and
    especially considering that the journey South costs a good
    deal.</p>

    <p>Give them my kind regards when you see them again. Roulin
    wants to be remembered to you. He was very pleased with what
    you said of him in your letter of today, but then he fully
    deserves it. With a handshake, and of course you know how I
    wish you happy days with your fianc&eacute;e.</p>

    <p>Ever Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Regards to Andr&eacute; Bonger if he is there too.</p>
