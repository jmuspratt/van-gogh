  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I more or less presume that you have gone to Holland. I am
    rather inclined to think that they were expecting you in
    Holland, from the letter I received from our sister, and also
    because I have not heard from you about this business.</p>

    <p>I have had a letter from Gauguin, in which he talks about
    painting, and complains of not having enough money to come
    here, but nothing new or different.</p>

    <p>I have sent Russell 12 drawings after painted studies, and
    so had an opportunity to speak to him about it again.</p>

    <p>It will soon be Michaelmas, and I have only taken the house
    till then. Am I to take it for a half-year again or not, that
    is what I would very much like to decide, after G. had seen it,
    and not without him.</p>

    <p>I could not pay my rent on the first, as I had the model all
    week. I am working on two portraits of the same model, which
    are more important to me than anything else. But it was just
    when I put my fellow off till next Monday for the month's rent
    that he said something about being able to find another tenant
    for the house if I had not decided to keep it. I'm not much
    surprised, since I have had it repaired myself, and it is worth
    more.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">In my last letter I forgot to answer your question about the
    new canvas from Tasset at 5.50 fr. It is very good and just
    what I wanted. If I do a portrait, or indeed anything that I am
    anxious to make lasting, he may be sure that I'll use it. But
    not much of it, as I have just made up my mind to use cheap
    canvas for the studies.</label></p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">If your package has not been sent off, I should very much
    like you to add 4 small tubes of geranium lake. If, indeed, I
    haven't already ordered this colour, but I don't think I
    ordered any reds except carmine.</label></p>

    <p>So now I am working on two figures, <art id=0433>one the head</art>, and
    <art id=0432>one a half length with the hands</art> of an old postman in a dark blue uniform.
    He has a head like Socrates, interesting to paint.</p>

    <p>There is no better or shorter way of improving your work
    than doing figures. And I always feel confident when I am doing
    portraits, knowing that this work has much more depth - it
    isn't the right word perhaps, but it is what makes me cultivate
    whatever is best and deepest in me.</p>

    <p>Good-by for the present, and a good handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
