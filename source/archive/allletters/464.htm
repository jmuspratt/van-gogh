    <p>Arles, c. 25<sup>th</sup> February 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your nice letter, also the 50-franc note.</p>

    <p>So far I haven't found life here as cheap as I'd hoped, but
    still I have three studies done, which probably I would not have
    been able to do in Paris these days.</p>

    <p>I am glad the news from Holland was pretty satisfactory. As
    for Reid, I am not very surprised - though he is wrong - that
    he has taken it badly that I got to the Midi before him. It would
    be rather unfair for us to say on our part that we would never
    have taken advantage of his acquaintance  since (1) he made us
    the present of a very beautiful painting (a painting which,
    parenthetically, we meant to get hold of); (2) Reid has made
    the price of the Monticellis go up, and since we own
    5 of them, it follows that these have gone up in value; (3) he was
    good and pleasant company for the first few months.</p>

    <p>For our part we wanted to make a far more important business
    arrangement with him than the Monticellis, and he pretended not to
    understand much about it.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that if we are to maintain the right to be
    masters on our own territory where the impressionists are
    concerned, so that there can be no doubt as to our good faith
    towards Reid - we might let him do as he likes, without
    interference from us, with the Monticellis of Marseilles.
    Insisting that our interest in the dead painters is only
    indirectly financial.</p>

    <p>And if you agree in this, you can, if necessary, tell him from
    me too that if he intends to come to Marseilles to buy
    Monticellis, he has nothing to fear from us, but that we have
    the right to ask what he intends to do, seeing that we have got
    the start on him on this territory.</p>

    <p>As for the impressionists, it seems only right to me that they
    should be introduced into England through your intermediary, rather
    than directly by you. And if Reid should get in first, we should
    be justified in maintaining that he had acted in bad faith
    towards us, more especially since we gave him a free hand with
    the Marseilles Monticellis.</p>

    <p>You are certainly helping our friend Koning by letting him
    stay with you - his visit to Rivet must have proved to him that
    we did not give him bad advice. If you want to take him in, I
    think that it would be a way out of the difficulty for him,
    only he must explain everything to his father so that
    you will not have any even indirect responsibilities.</p>

    <p>If you see Bernard, tell him that so far I have had to pay
    more than at Pont-Aven, but that I think if one got private
    lodgings here, one could economize; that is what I am trying to
    find, and as soon as I have verified it, I will write to him
    what I think the average expenses come to.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">It seems to me at times
    that my blood is more or less actually beginning to think of
    circulating, which was not the case during the last
    days in Paris. Honestly, I could not have stood it much longer.</label></p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I have to get my paints and canvases either at a grocer's or
    at a booksellers, and they haven't got everything I need. I shall
    have to go to Marseilles to see what the state of this sort of thing
    is there. I had hoped to find some good blue, etc.,
    and I still think I may, since one must be able to buy the
    raw material at first hand in Marseilles.</p>

    <p>And I wish I could make blues like Zeim - they don't fade so much
    as the others - one day we shall see.<label></p>

    <p>Don't worry, and give a handshake to the comrades from me.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>The studies I've done are - <art id=0390>an old Arl&eacute;sienne woman</art>,
    <art id=0391>a landscape with snow</art>, <art id=0389>a
    view of a bit of a pavement with a charcuterie [pork-butcher's shop]</art>.
    The women are quite beautiful here, that is no lie - but on the
    other hand the museum in Arles is atrocious and a joke, and
    ought to be in Tarascon. There is also a museum of genuine antiques here.</p>
