    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have quite filled your little book <sup>1</sup>, and I
    think it turned out well. When you have a chance send me
    &ldquo;La Falaise&rdquo; [The Cliff] by Jules Breton.</p>

    <p>Our gallery is ready now and is very beautiful, we have some
    splendid pictures: Jules Dupr&eacute;, Michel, Daubigny, Maris,
    Isra&euml;ls, Mauve, Bisschop, etc. In April we are going to
    have an exhibition. Mr. Boussod has promised to send us the
    best things available: &ldquo;La Malaria&rdquo; by
    H&eacute;bert, &ldquo;La Falaise&rdquo; by Jules Breton,
    etc.</p>

    <p>How I should like to have you here - we must manage that
    someday. How I should love to show you my room!</p>

    <p>There is a beautiful exhibition of old art here, including:
    a large &ldquo;Descent from the Cross&rdquo; by Rembrandt; 5
    large figures in twilight - you can imagine the sentiment; 5
    Ruysdaels; 1 Frans Hals; Van Dijck; a landscape with figures by
    Rubens; &ldquo;Autumn Evening&rdquo; by Titian; 2 portraits by
    Tintoretto; and some beautiful old English art - Reynolds,
    Romney, and a splendid <i>Old Crome</i> landscape.</p>

    <p>Adieu. I shall send you your little book at the first
    opportunity. Write soon.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
