    <p>Letter T31<br>
     Paris, 29 March 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>How happy I should be if I could go to you and shake your
    hand on the festive occasion of your birthday. Will it be a
    festive occasion for you, or is your condition still such that
    you are unhappy? What do you do in the daytime, and do you have
    something to do to divert your mind? Can you read, and do you
    get everything you want? After your last letter I hoped that
    you had entered upon a period of convalescence, and that you
    could have told me soon after that you were feeling better. My
    dear brother, how sad it is for us to be at such a distance
    from one another, and to know so little what the other one is
    doing. For this reason I am very happy to be able to tell you
    that I met Dr. Gachet, that physician Pissarro mentioned to me.
    He gives the impression of being a man of understanding.
    Physically he is a little like you. As soon as you come here we
    are going to see him; he comes to Paris several times a week
    for consultations. When I told him how your crisis came about,
    he said to me that he didn't believe it had anything to do with
    madness, and that if it was what he thought he could guarantee
    your recovery, but that it was necessary for him to see you and
    to speak with you in order to be able to make a more definite
    statement. He is a man who may be of use to us when you come
    here. Have you spoken about it to Dr. Peyron, and what did he
    say? I have not yet gone back to the Independents, but
    Pissarro, who went there every day, tells me that you have
    achieved real success with the artists. There were also art
    lovers who discussed your pictures with me without my drawing
    their attention to them. The papers which publish reports on
    the exhibition are silent about the hall of the impressionists.
    And it is the best thing they can do, for the majority of those
    criticisms - well, you know what they are worth.</p>

    <p>It is beginning to be real spring here. This afternoon Jo
    and the baby were in the little square in front of Trinity
    Church. The shrubs are beginning to get green, and the trees
    show little green tips peeping forth from the buds, all bathed
    in beneficent sunshine, and the grey colour of the church
    against the intense blue of the sky was very beautiful. Jo and
    the child are very well. It is true that there is a little
    hitch from time to time, but nothing serious. The doctor who
    came this week said that he was a magnificent child, and he
    complimented Jo on him. You will see how funny he is in his
    movements.</p>

    <p>My dear brother, I am anxious to know whether you are
    feeling better, and to receive particulars about your health.
    Be of good heart and cling to the hope that things will soon
    take a turn for the better.</p>

    <p>I am sending you some reproductions of etchings by
    Rembrandt; they are so lovely.</p>

    <p>A cordial handshake, and believe me to be your loving
    brother.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>
