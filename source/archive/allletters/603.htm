    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>The reason I am writing you a second time today is that I am
    enclosing a few words for our friend Gauguin; as I felt my calm
    returning these last days, it seemed to me sufficient so that
    my letter would not turn out to be absolutely ridiculous;
    besides, if you over-refine scruples of respect or sentiment,
    it is not certain that you gain in courtesy or common sense.
    That being so, it does one good to talk to the other fellows
    again even at a distance.</p>

    <p>And you, old man, how are things going? Write me a few lines
    one of these days, for I think that the emotions which must
    seize the future father of a family, the emotions which our
    good father so liked to talk about, in your case as in his,
    must be great and fine, but are for the moment rather beyond
    your expressing in the rather incoherent medley of the petty
    vexations of Paris. After all, realities of this kind must be
    like a good mistral, not very caressing but purifying. I assure
    you it is a great pleasure to me too, and will contribute much
    to relieving me of my mental fatigue and, perhaps, of my
    indifference. After all, it is something to get back one's
    interest in life, when I think that I am about to pass into the
    state of an uncle to this boy planned by your wife. I find it
    very funny that she feels so sure it is a boy, but that remains
    to be seen.</p>

    <p>Anyway, meanwhile the only thing I can do is plod a little
    at my pictures. <art id=0735>I have one going of a moonrise over the same
    field as the sketch in Gauguin's letter, but in it some stacks
    take the place of the wheat. It is dull yellow-ochre and violet</art>. Anyway, you will see
    it in a short time. I am also working on a new one with ivy.</p>

    <p>Above all, old man, I beg you not to fret or be worried or
    unhappy about me; the idea you might get into your head of this
    necessary and salutary quarantine would have little
    justification when we need a slow and patient recovery. If we
    can manage that, we will save our strength for next winter.
    Here I imagine the winter must be very dismal. Anyway, I must
    try to occupy myself all the same. I often think that next
    winter I might retouch a lot of last year's studies from Arles.
    So just lately, having kept back a big study of an orchard
    which had given me great difficulty (it is the same orchard you
    will find a variant of but very vague, in the package), I set
    myself to work it over again from memory, and I have found the
    way to express the harmony of the tones more strongly.</p>

    <p>Tell me, have you received those drawings of mine? I sent
    you half a dozen once by parcel post and ten or so later on. If
    by chance you have not received them yet they must have been
    lying at the station for weeks on end.</p>

    <p>The doctor here said to me about Monticelli that he always
    thought him an eccentric, but that as for madness, he had only
    been a little that way toward the end. Considering all the
    misery of Monticelli's last years, is there any reason to be
    surprised that he gave way under too heavy a load, and has one
    any right to deduce from this that artistically speaking he
    fell short in his work?</p>

    <p>I do not believe it, he had such a power of logical
    calculation and originality as a painter that it is still
    regrettable that he hadn't the stamina to make its flowering
    more complete.</p>

    <p>I am sending you enclosed a sketch of the cicadas here [F
    1445, JH 1765].</p>

    <p>Their song in the great heat here has the same charm for me
    as the cricket on the heart for the peasants at home. Old man -
    don't let's forget that the little emotions are the great
    captains of our lives, and that we obey them without knowing
    it. If it is still hard for me to take courage again in spite
    of faults committed, and to be committed, which must be my
    cure, don't forget henceforth that neither our spleen nor our
    melancholy, nor yet our feelings of good nature or common
    sense, are our sole guides, and above all not our final
    protection and that if you too find yourself faced with heavy
    responsibilities to be risked if not undertaken, honestly,
    don't let's be too much concerned about each other, since it so
    happens that the circumstances of living in a state so far
    removed from our youthful conceptions of an artist's life must
    make us brothers in spite of everything, as we are in so many
    ways companions in fate. Things are so closely connected that
    here you sometimes find cockroaches in the food as if you were
    really in Paris; on the other hand, it may be that in Paris you
    sometimes catch a real feeling of the fields. It certainly is
    not much, but after all it is reassuring. So take your
    fatherhood as a good soul on our old heaths would take it,
    those heaths which, through all the noise, tumult and fogginess
    of the cities, still remain with us, inexpressibly dear -
    however timid our tenderness may be. That is to say, let this
    be your notion of fatherhood, exile and stranger and poor man
    that you are, and henceforth, find strength, with the instinct
    of the poor, in the probability of a real, real life of one's
    fatherland, a real life at least in memory, even though we may
    forget it every day. Sooner or later, such as it is, we meet
    our destinies, but certainly it would be a sort of hypocrisy if
    I were to forget all the good humour, the happy-go-lucky
    carelessness of the poor devils that we were, coming and going
    in this Paris that has become so strange, and to let it weigh
    us down out of proportion to our real load of cares.</p>

    <p>Indeed, I am so glad that if there are sometimes cockroaches
    in the food here, you have your wife and child at home.</p>

    <p>Besides, it is cheering that Voltaire, for instance, has
    left us at liberty not to believe absolutely everything we
    imagine.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">Thus, while sharing your wife's anxiety about your health, I
    am not going so far as to believe what now and then for a
    moment I imagined - namely that worry on my account was the
    cause of your comparatively long silence - though that is so
    easily explained when one realizes how her condition must
    occupy your mind. But it is quite all right, and it is the road
    that everyone must take in our world.</label></p>

    <p>Good-bye for now and a good handshake for you and Jo.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>In haste, but I wanted not to delay sending the letter for
    old Gauguin, you surely have the address.</p>
