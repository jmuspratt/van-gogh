  <body>
    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half June 1885</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and the enclosure. It was just what I
    wanted and helped me to work as hard at the end of the month as
    I did in the beginning.</p>

    <p>I am very glad to hear that Serret is a painter, about whom
    you had already written things which I perfectly well remember,
    but the name had escaped me. I should like to write to you much
    more than I shall do in this letter, but of late, when I come
    home, I don't feel like writing, after sitting in the sun all
    day. As to what Serret says, I quite agree with him - I shall
    just send him a line, because I should like to become friends
    with him. As I told you already, I have been busy drawing
    figures recently; I will send them especially for the sake of
    Serret, to show him that I am far from indifferent to the unity
    and the form of a figure.</p>

    <p>Do you ever see Wallis, is that <art id=1230>watercolour of the auction</art>
    perhaps something for him; if it were something for Wisselingh,
    then he would certainly be the right one to take it. To
    Wisselingh I once gave a few heads and recently I have sent him
    <art id=1661>that lithograph</art>. But as he did not answer with a single word, I
    think if I sent him something more, I should get nothing but an
    insult. [Wallis and Wisselingh were art dealers on friendly
    terms with the two brothers]</p>

    <p>It has just happened to me that Van Rappard, with whom I
    have been friends for years, after keeping silent for about
    three months, writes me a letter, so haughty and so full of
    insults and so clearly written after he had been in The Hague,
    that I am almost sure I have lost him for ever as a friend.</p>

    <p>Just because I tried it first at The Hague, that is in my
    own country, I have full right and cause to forget all those
    worries and to attempt something else outside my own
    country.</p>

    <p>You know Wallis well, perhaps you can broach the subject
    apropos of that watercolour, but act according to your
    discretion. <label content="business.selling">If I could earn something with my work, if we had
    some firm ground, be it ever so little, under our feet for our
    daily existence, and if then the desire to become an artist
    took for you the form of, let me say, Hennebeau in Germinal, [A
    famous novel by Zola] discounting all difference in age, etc. -
    what pictures you could still make then! </label>The future is always
    different from what one expects, so one never can be sure. The
    drawback of painting is that, if one does not sell one's
    pictures, one still needs money for paint and models in order
    to make progress. And that drawback is a bad thing. But for the
    rest, painting and, in my opinion. especially the painting of
    rural life, gives serenity, though one may have all kinds of
    worries and miseries on the surface of life. I mean painting is
    a <i>home</i> and one does not experience that homesickness,
    that peculiar feeling Hennebeau had. That passage I copied for
    you lately had struck me particularly, because at the time I
    had almost literally the same longing to be something like a
    grass mower or a navvy.</p>

    <p>And I was sick of the <i>boredom</i> of civilization. It
    <i>is</i> better, one <i>is</i> happier if one carries it out -
    literally though - one feels at least that one is really alive.
    And it is a good thing in winter to be deep in the snow, in the
    autumn deep in the yellow leaves, in summer among the ripe
    corn, in spring amid the grass; it is a good thing to be always
    with the mowers and the peasant girls, in summer with a big sky
    overhead, in winter by the fireside, and to feel that it always
    has been and always will be so.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">One may sleep on straw, eat black bread, well, one will only
    be the healthier for it.</label></p>

    <p>I should like to write more, but I repeat, I am not in a
    mood for writing, and I wanted to enclose a note for Serret
    besides, which you must read also, because I write in it about
    what I want to send before long, especially because I want to
    show Serret my complete figure studies. Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Serret may agree with you that to paint good pictures and to
    sell them are two separate things. But it is not at all true.
    When at last the public saw Millet, all his work together, then
    the public both in Paris and in London was enthusiastic.</p>

    <p>And who were the persons that had suppressed and refused
    Millet? The art dealers, the so-called
    <i>experts</i>.</p>
