  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your last letter and the enclosure in good order
    and thank you for it with all my heart. I was and am even now
    rather hard up, that is to say, in regard to painting. There
    are so many, many expenses. This is partly because so many
    things that I start turn out wrong, and then one has to begin
    anew, and all the trouble has been in vain - except that after
    all, this is the way to make progress, and one must
    persevere.</p>

    <p>In your last letter there was no answer to what I asked you
    about, whether or not to send the painted studies. Perhaps you
    forgot all about it. So I thought that after all it is not a
    question of real importance, and today I sent you a painted
    study by mail. But as I told you in my last letter, of course I
    would much rather that you saw them all together; and of course
    you can't judge the future from the one, as I have been
    handling the brush for too short a time not to expect great
    changes.</p>

    <p>I would rather have sent you something else, but the one I
    would like to send is not dry enough to be rolled. Like myself,
    you will find much to criticize in the background. I can only
    give this explanation for it, the study is made as a study of
    the foreground, that is, the tree roots; there had already been
    so much work on them, and as usual I didn't sit quietly because
    of the passers-by, and when I had brought the study as far as
    you see it now, I couldn't stand it any longer.</p>

    <p>You cannot imagine how irritating and tiring it is when
    people always stand so close to you. Sometimes it makes me so
    nervous that I have to give up. So yesterday morning, though it
    was still very early and I had hoped to be left alone, a study
    of the chestnut trees in the Bezuidenhout (which are so
    splendid) turned out all wrong for this reason. And people are
    sometimes so rude and impertinent. Well, but it is not just the
    disappointment it causes, but also the waste of materials. Of
    course such things will not get the better of me, and I shall
    overcome them just as other people do, but I feel I should
    reach my goal much more quickly if there were less of those
    little miseries.</p>

    <p>Now as for this study; if when looking at it and knowing
    that I have many more besides this one, you do not regret
    having enabled me to make it, then I shall be satisfied and
    shall continue with good courage. If it is a disappointment to
    you, you must remember that it is such a short time since I
    began painting. If it pleases you, so much the better for me,
    for I want so much to send you something that gives you
    pleasure.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.father">Now I still have to tell you that quite unexpectedly I had a
    very pleasant visit from Father, at my house at the studio; I
    think this infinitely better than his hearing about me from
    others.</p>

    <p>If people come to see me, well, then their impression is at
    least original, but I do not like opinions which are based on
    what people say.</p>

    <p>I was really very glad to see Father and to talk to him.</label> I
    again heard a great deal about Nuenen; that churchyard with the
    old crosses. I cannot get it out of my head. I hope I shall be
    able to paint it someday. I also heard a great deal about your
    visit, and that you gave them that engraving after
    Isra&euml;ls, which greatly touched them.</p>

    <p>I should have liked to send you a marine too, but the last
    one is not quite dry. I might have sent the first one, but
    since then I have caught the colour of the sea better, and so
    I'll wait until one of the last ones is dry. I have painted
    much more lately than I originally intended and than I agreed
    on with you. But perhaps it is necessary to keep on doing it,
    if at all possible.</p>

    <p>I have just received a letter from Rappard. I wish he lived
    a little nearer.</p>

    <p>And remember that I want to hear your criticisms exactly as
    you think. I often feel the longing and need to ask someone's
    advice on different questions, but I do not give in to it after
    what happened with Mauve, and I do not talk to painters about
    my work. Somebody may be remarkably clever, but what use is it
    to me when he tells me to do things differently from the way he
    does it himself? I would rather Mauve had told me something
    about the use of body colour instead of saying, &ldquo;Under no
    circumstances must you use body colour,&rdquo; whereas he
    himself and all the others almost always use it, and with the
    best results. Well, in many cases, one will eventually be able
    to find out things for oneself, and that is what I try to do.
    Yes, if I could do exactly what I wanted, I should undertake
    painting on an even larger scale, and especially with more
    models.</p>

    <p>When I don't paint, I draw from the figure a great deal.</p>

    <p>In this study the figure is there only for the size, so that
    I shall be able to find the proportions of some other figure
    when I use this study. Of course a real figure is quite
    different; it presents many more difficulties. Then it is also
    there to give a little accent.</p>

    <p>So please understand, brother, that I am sending you this
    only because I didn't know what to do, as you didn't write
    about it. Of course a real figure is quite different from this,
    and I send it the same way I sometimes send you a little
    sketch, to give you an idea of what I am making.</p>

    <p>Adieu, a handshake in thought. <label content="health.general">I send you all possible good
    wishes, and hope that your headache is not chronic or one which
    returns again and again. With me it is also more a feeling of
    uncomfortable fatigue than of excessive pain.</label></p>

    <p>I took a walk on the Rijswijk road with Father; it is very
    beautiful there. Again farewell, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>If this one arrives in good condition, it will be an easy
    way to send you things. I don't know if one can send drawings
    or pictures by mail as printed matter.</p>

    <p>Another thing, you understand that I could do with some
    little branches, etc., differently if I painted them anew; but
    in my opinion one mustn't change too much in studies which must
    be used later. They must be put up in the studio just the way
    they come from the wood; to some people they may look less
    pleasant, but for the painter himself there is more of his own
    impression in them.</p>
