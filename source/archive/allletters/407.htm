    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Yesterday I sent you a number of painted studies by post,
    and today, Wednesday, a box marked V1 carriage-paid, containing
    <art id=0082>the picture</art>.</p>

    <p>Please acknowledge receipt, and tell me at the same time if
    the carriage was sufficiently prepaid. If not I should like to
    know with a view to later parcels. If it was right, it costs me
    not quite 2 guilders, which I think cheaper than when the
    carriage is paid at Paris, and we can try it again some other
    time, also with rather large dimensions.</p>

    <p>I do not know what you will think of the picture, but be
    careful not to order frames at once for this and for later
    pictures.</p>

    <p>For the present we can use our money better making new
    pictures. And let us only begin to frame them when we have a
    small collection. At least, that's what I should like best.
    What with the many small studies I make, the expenses are
    indeed heavier than I can manage at present; I just had to pay
    25 guilders for rent, too.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">But I do think the picture requires a background of gold or
    brass. Because then the marbled aspect disappears, and the
    lights get relief. But that effect can easily be obtained by
    putting a bit of ochre-coloured paper behind it.</p>

    <p>It was not yet completely dry when I packed it, but I
    thought it could hardly be damaged.</p>

    <p>I should have liked to work on it even longer, but because
    of the sinking in and because I had already varnished it more
    than once, I felt I had to leave it alone.</label></p>

    <p>And I shall start a new thing at once.</p>

    <p>My moving is over now. Those at home are hardly what you
    imagine, and what they say is &ldquo;that I followed my own
    head.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, never mind, I'd rather not talk about it.</p>

    <p>I must set to work, so goodbye for today.</p>

    <p>I have had two other stretchers made of the same size as
    this canvas; I think if we have, say, three or four pictures of
    a certain size, then it will be worth while to have a frame in
    that size. But there is too much risk for a single one, and it
    is better to paint a great deal.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
