    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">Today I send you by parcel post three studies which I hope
    are dry enough; however, if they stick to the sheet of paper I
    put over them as a precaution, sponge them off with tepid
    water. The paint on the smallest one especially has sunk in a
    lot. In a week or so brush it over with the white of an egg, or
    with a little varnish in a month, to restore the colour.</label> I send
    them to you to give you an idea of the work, which will be
    better as I go along, you know.</p>

    <p>I forgot to reply to what you wrote about sending the money;
    for the present I beg you to send it by postal order, as you
    did last time, till I have found an exchange office; but deduct
    the expenses.</p>

    <p>I had a letter from home. Father had been unwell after
    having a fall. I hope it is not more serious than they wrote -
    do you know anything more about it?</p>

    <p>Last week I went farther into the peat fields - splendid
    scenery. I think it is more and more beautiful here, and I
    intend to stay in this neighbourhood from now on. For it is so
    beautiful here that it will require a lot more study to render
    it, and only very elaborate work can give an exact idea of the
    way things are basically in their serious, sober character. I
    have seen superb figures, but I repeat, a scenery that has so
    much nobility, so much dignity and gravity, must be treated
    after deep reflection and with patience and steady work.
    Therefore, I must attack things as if I had come here merely to
    get a glimpse of them; but if everything goes well, and if we
    have some luck, it goes without saying that I shall stay here
    for good.</p>

    <p>Do write again soon. <label content="feelings.loneliness">I
    long to hear from you, for I feel
    gloomy, notwithstanding the beautiful scenery.</label> Adieu, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Remember me to Wisselingh when you meet him, and tell him I
    am here.</p>
