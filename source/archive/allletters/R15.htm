    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>When I began collecting wood engravings, I was often annoyed
    by the fact that I could not make out the meaning of the
    monograms which many English black-and-white artists use.</p>

    <p>Even now I don't know what all of them stand for, but at
    least I am acquainted with some of them, and a list of them
    will possibly be of some use to you, though perhaps you know
    them all.</p>

    <p>I am sure I've skipped some of them, but these are the ones
    I remember at the moment.</p>

    <p>In Harper's Weekly there are beautiful things by Howard
    Pyle, Harper, Rogers, Abbey, Alexander and others.</p>

    <p>I am sure you know Caton Woodville, Overend, Nash, Dodd,
    Gregory, Watson, Stamland [Staniland?], Smythe, Hennessy,
    Emslie from their large drawings in the Graphic and the London
    News.</p>

    <p>I also have a very nice thing by Small; this man is
    amazingly clever.</p>

    <p>I don't know whether you know Scribner's magazine and
    Harper's Monthly Review; there are always very distinguished
    things in them.</p>

    <p>For the present I have only a few of them, as they are
    rather expensive and one hardly ever finds secondhand
    copies.</p>

    <p>The British Workman and the Cottage and Artisan<i>,</i> both
    penny papers of the London Tract Society, sometimes have very
    tame things, but at other times, robust, beautiful things
    too.</p>

    <p>As soon as you have the time, I should like to hear more
    particulars about what you have, for you are sure to have some
    things that I do not possess, and I am interested in everything
    relating to the subject. I should like to see the portrait of
    Shakespeare by Menzel sooner or later.</p>

    <p>Just tell me, how are your <i>watercolours</i> getting on?
    These last few weeks I have been working hard on mine; also
    types from the people.</p>

    <p>How beautiful it is out-of-doors; sometimes I long for a
    country where it is always autumn, but then we should not have
    snow and apple blossoms, and no wheat and fields of
    stubble.</p>

    <p>Please check whether at any time you received from me a
    large wood engraving, unsigned by the artist, representing
    ladies and gentlemen on horseback in a park; I think it is the
    Empress of Austria, in whose honour a hunting party or
    something of the kind is being given. If you haven't got it -
    although I believe you received it last summer - I have a
    duplicate of it here, for I found another one recently.</p>

    <p>Also one by Knaus - a hunter giving a piece of bread to his
    dog.</p>

    <p>Speaking of landscapes, I've always liked Birket Forster and
    Read, even though they're considered old-fashioned. Among the
    Reads I have an &ldquo;Autumn Effect&rdquo; and a
    &ldquo;Moonlight Scene&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Snow Effect,&rdquo;
    which are very beautiful.</p>

    <p>English landscape painting is very divergent in conception.
    Forster is very little like Edwin Edwards, but both styles have
    their raison d'&ecirc;tre. Wyllie and others with him are more
    especially colourists, or rather they seek more after tone.
    Particularly in Scribner's magazine and Harper's Monthly there
    are very fine things rather in Wyllie's manner - little
    marines, snow effects, etc., nooks of streets and gardens.</p>

    <p>In Routledge's Sixpenny Series there is among other things
    <i>Oliver Twist,</i> illustrated by J. Mahoney, which I
    strongly recommend to you; and also the <i>Story of a
    Feather,</i> illustrated by du Maurier; and <i>Certain
    Lectures,</i> with drawings by Ch. Keene - but he has nicer
    ones in <i>Punch.</i> Du Maurier is rather like Menzel,
    especially in some of his large compositions.</p>

    <p>At one time F&eacute;licien Rops and De Groux did among
    other things some beautiful types in Belgium, in a magazine
    called Uilenspiegel [Owlglass], which I used to have, which I
    should be extremely glad to have again, but which, alas, I
    can't find. There were things in it by De Groux particularly,
    which were as beautiful as Isra&euml;ls.</p>

    <p>Well, old fellow, I must get back to my work; I wanted to
    send you the list of monograms before I lost it again. Adieu,
    write again soon, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
