  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and the enclosure. What pleases me so
    much is that now you yourself propose the plan of going to
    Cormon's.</p>

    <p>Let me tell you how things have been going here.</p>

    <p>The painting course ended last week, because at the end of
    the course a competition is held for those who have gone
    through the whole course, among whom I do not belong.</p>

    <p>I am also drawing in the daytime now, and the teacher there,
    who makes portraits at present and gets well paid for them, has
    asked me repeatedly if I had never drawn from plaster casts
    before and if I had taught myself to draw, and he concluded:
    &ldquo;Je vois que vous avez beaucoup travaill&eacute;,&rdquo;
    and, &ldquo;Vous ne serez pas long &agrave; faire du
    progr&egrave;s, vous y gagneriez beaucoup - il faut un an, mais
    qu'est-ce que &ccedil;a fait?&rdquo; [I see that you have
    worked a lot, <i>and</i>, it will not take you long to make
    progress, you will gain much by it - it will take a year, but
    what does that matter?]</p>

    <p>Now there is one fellow of my age sitting next to me to whom
    he does <i>not</i> say that, and he has also painted a long
    time and he has been drawing from plaster casts for three
    years. As a rule they draw there without a background, and
    especially the man in question is absolutely forbidden to do
    it. This makes awfully dry drawings.</p>

    <p>Now Sibert, that is the name of the teacher who also directs
    the class for drawing from the nude, said, &ldquo;Quant
    &agrave; vous, vous dessinerez comme il vous plaira, puisque je
    vois que vous prenez le dessin au s&eacute;rieux, quant aux
    autres, en g&eacute;neral je ne leur permets pas de faire un
    fond, parce qu'alors ils escamottent le dessin des formes,
    tandis que sur fond blanc ils sont bien oblig&eacute;s de les
    faire, c'est donc une camisole de force.&rdquo; [As for you,
    you will draw as you please, for I see that you take drawing
    seriously; as for the others, I generally don't allow them to
    draw a background, for then they botch the drawing of the
    forms, whereas they are obliged to do them on a white
    background; so it is a straitjacket.]</p>

    <p>Then he also said that Verlat had told him there was some
    good in my work which Verlat did not say to me.</p>

    <p>Just after the receipt of your letter it happened that
    Sibert came to look at the drawings (mine was a head of Niobe
    and a hand that might be done by Michelangelo). I had drawn
    that hand within a few hours, and that was the drawing he liked
    best. Now l told him that l intended to go to Cormon, and he
    said: &ldquo;Vous ferez comme vous voudrez, mais je vous dis
    que Verlat en a form&eacute; plusieurs de forts et nous y
    tenons &agrave; former des &eacute;l&egrave;ves qui nous
    fassent honneur - et je vous engage bien fortement de
    rester.&rdquo; [You may do as you like, but I tell you that
    Verlat has trained several strong ones, and we attach great
    value to training pupils who are a credit to us - and I advise
    you most strongly to stay (with us).]</p>

    <p>This is almost a handsome promise, as if they guarantee
    success, and what shall I do? On the other hand, I have become
    better acquainted with those English fellows who have been in
    Paris, and I have heard their experiences. One was at
    G&eacute;r&ocirc;me's and one at Cabanel's, etc.</p>

    <p>They say that one is relatively freer in Paris and, for
    instance, one can choose one's subjects more freely than one
    can here, but that the correction is not worth much.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I think? In Paris I should certainly work
    <i>more</i> than here, for instance a drawing a day or every
    two days.</p>

    <p>And we know, or rather you know, enough clever fellows who
    would not refuse to look them over and give some hints. So in
    fact we are at all events on the right track, whether I stay
    here some time or come to you.</p>

    <p>For the rest, Cormon would probably say the same thing as
    Verlat. Just because I now have the opportunity to talk to
    several people about my drawings, <i>I see my mistakes</i>, and
    that is half the battle.</p>

    <p>At all events let's keep courage. But now you must write a
    little more and we must try to do things energetically. I hear
    they work for four hours in the morning at Cormon's, then in
    the evening one can go and work at the Louvre or at the Ecole
    des Beaux-Arts or some other studio where drawing is done.</p>

    <p>As to the portraits, there will not be much time left for
    them if I want to keep up all the other things regularly. It is
    the same here.</p>

    <p>But it has struck me forcibly that there are still other
    things that I absolutely must change.</p>

    <p>When I compare myself to the other fellows, there is
    something stiff and awkward about me, as if I had been <i>in
    prison</i> for ten years.</p>

    <p>And the cause of this is that for about ten years I have had
    a difficult and harassed life, much care and sorrow and no
    friends.</p>

    <p>But that will change as my work gets better, and I shall
    know something and be able to do something.</p>

    <p>And I repeat, we are on the right track to accomplishing
    this. But do not doubt it, the way to succeed is to keep
    courage and patience and to work on energetically.</p>

    <p>And it is a fact that I must change my outward appearance
    somewhat. Perhaps you will say that has nothing to do with art,
    but on the other hand, perhaps you will agree with me <label subject="health.dental.toothloss">I am
    having my teeth seen to, for instance, there are no less than
    ten teeth that I have either lost or may lose, and that is too
    many and too troublesome,</label> and besides, it makes me look over
    forty, which is not to my advantage.</p>

    <p>So I have decided to have that taken care of. It will cost
    me 100 fr., but it can be done better now while I am drawing
    than at any other time, and I have had the bad teeth cut off
    and have just paid half the money in advance.</p>

    <p>They told me at the same time that I ought to take care of
    my stomach, for it's in a bad state. And since I have been here
    this has far from improved.</p>

    <p>But if one knows where the fault lies, that is something
    gained, and with some energy much can be redressed.</p>

    <p>It is not at all pleasant, but necessity knows no law, and
    if one wants to paint pictures, one must try and stay alive and
    keep one's strength.</p>

    <p>I thought my teeth were bad for another reason, and I didn't
    know that my <label subject="health.gastrointestinal.stomach">stomach had deteriorated to such a degree.</label> It is
    stupid if you will, but sometimes one has to choose between two
    evils, and is trapped on both sides.</p>

    <p>During the last month it began to trouble me a great deal; I
    began to cough continually too, and to expectorate a grayish
    phlegm, etc., so that I began to get uneasy. But we will try to
    redress it.</p>

    <p>You see I am not stronger than other people in that if I
    neglected myself too much, it would be the same with me as with
    so <i>many</i> painters (so <i>very many</i> if one thinks it
    over), I should drop dead, or worse still - become insane or an
    idiot.</p>

    <p>This is a fact, and the question is to steer a clear course
    between the various cliffs, and even if one gets damaged, to
    try to keep the ship afloat.</p>

    <p>I know that Delacroix said he had learned the secret of
    painting: &ldquo;Lorsqu'il n'avait plus ni dents ni
    souffle.&rdquo; [When he had neither teeth nor breath left.]
    But I also know that from that moment he took care of himself.
    And that, except for his mistress, he would have died ten or
    more years sooner.</p>

    <p>So do not be angry with me because of the expense. I shall
    try to economize, but things were getting too bad and I had to
    remedy them.</p>

    <p>As to what you wrote about the folks at home, in this matter
    I shall do what you think best. <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>I am free to leave here whenever I like. Let's say in the
    first days of March. But just consider if the help I might be
    able to give would be worth the journey there and back, for I
    would also approve of staying here without going back, and from
    here straight to Cormon, whenever you like. The journey is
    rather expensive when I reckon that the luggage costs me more
    than my own fare.</p>

    <p>So let's think it over again.</p>

    <p>I keep feeling satisfied with having come here, otherwise I
    should have remained in a fix; and now, though there are still
    many difficulties, I see some chance of making progress.</p>

    <p>And by staying here somewhat longer, or by going to Paris, I
    shall get an even firmer hold.</p>

    <p>As to the plan of possibly living together and taking a
    rather good studio where one can receive people if need be,
    keep it in mind, and let me keep it in mind too.</p>

    <p>In the first place I see that year of drawing from which I'm
    afraid there's no escape. If it isn't expensive, and you find
    good quarters, then it would be all right; but if it is
    expensive, perhaps it would not be the cheapest way for the
    first year if we are rather hard up.</p>

    <p>The year of drawing is the critical point; after that we are
    free to do other things, both portrait and landscape. I think
    we must put that first. There is no help for it - didn't
    Delacroix and Corot and Millet keep thinking of the ancients
    and continue studying them? People who just study them <i>in a
    hurry</i> are of course quite wrong. The ancients certainly
    require a great serenity, a knowledge of nature, they require
    tenderness and patience, otherwise they are no help.</p>

    <p>And it is quite curious that G&eacute;ricault and Delacroix
    both knew them more intimately than, for instance, David, and
    understood them better; they who were most strongly opposed to
    all academic routine.</p>

    <p>I do not yet know Turgenev's books, but some time ago I read
    his biography, which was very interesting, how he had, in
    common with Daudet, that passion for working from the model,
    blending five or six models into a single type - I do not know
    Ohnet either, who I hear is very interesting too.</p>

    <p>More and more I believe that l'art pour l'art, to work for
    work's sake, l'&eacute;nergie pour l'&eacute;nergie - is after
    all the principle of all great artists, for in the case of the
    de Goncourts one sees how necessary obstinacy is, for society
    will not thank them for it.</p>

    <p>But in painting one finds a certain rest in the histories of
    those painters who aimed at the most sublime through it
    all.</p>

    <p>Isra&euml;ls himself, for instance, was still quite unknown
    and poor, even to the extent of having nothing to eat but dry
    bread - when he nevertheless wanted to go to Paris, though the
    circumstances were discouraging enough.</p>

    <p><i>Not</i> to be discouraged, even though one is almost
    starving, and though one feels one has to say farewell to all
    material comfort in life! So much for that. I wish you would
    write a little more, now that we are discussing a change.</p>

    <p>Founding a studio together would perhaps be a <i>good
    thing</i>, but we must feel sure that we can carry it through -
    and we must know our own minds perfectly, and once we begin it,
    we must have a certain confidence after all, left us after a
    long series of lost illusions.</p>

    <p>And such a studio - in starting it one must know that it
    will be a battle and that people in general will be absolutely
    indifferent, so one ought to begin it feeling confident of some
    power - wanting to be somebody, wanting to be active - so that
    when one dies one can think, I go where all those who have
    dared something go - well, we shall see.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>That impression I can't help getting of myself when
    comparing myself to others, namely that I look as if I had been
    in prison for ten years, is not exaggerated; but to change it -
    and I will change it - I must primarily not get too far out of
    the art world, but stay some time longer in a studio or at an
    academy. Then it will disappear.</p>
