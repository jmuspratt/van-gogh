    <p>Letter T15 <sup>1</sup><br>
     Paris, 16 August 1889</p>

    <p>Dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>We received your letter for Cor, and handed it to him this
    morning, for he arrived here very early, at six o'clock. We are
    so overjoyed that he was able to travel to Southampton by way
    of Paris - in all probability he will be gone for a long time,
    and Theo especially would have been extremely sorry if he had
    not been able to see him once more. This very morning we
    started showing him the town, from the Place de
    l'&Eacute;toile to the Place de la Bastille, and he was
    quite enraptured. Theo was just a little bit disappointed that
    there was not a single little word to him, do write him soon -
    if only <i>one</i> tiny word - we are so anxious to hear from
    you personally about how you are, and we hope from the bottom
    of our hearts that you will be feeling better soon. You have no
    idea how often you are thought of and spoken of. Mother too
    wrote that she was longing for a letter from you. Do you know
    what Cor brought with him from her this morning? - a pair of
    the sweetest little socks for our little boy (for I persist in
    believing that it will be a little boy - however much you may
    laugh at me!).</p>

    <p>If possible, do write a little word to Theo soon
    <sup>2</sup> - he is so anxious for it. A cordial handshake in
    thought.</p>

    <p>Lovingly yours, Jo</p>
