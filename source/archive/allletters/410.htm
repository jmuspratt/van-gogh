  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for this month's early remittance. I am very pleased
    to hear what you write about the picture, Portier's and
    Serret's remarks, and that they found good things in it. I
    myself criticize it too, and perhaps more seriously than they,
    especially regarding the torsos - so I don't want them to
    approve of it entirely. When you see them someday, just tell
    them that it is quite possible I shall change the present brass
    and soft-soap-like colours, but that I hope this change will be
    twofold, that is to say that I expect to paint some in a
    lighter colour scale, more like flesh and blood, but that at
    the same time I am trying to get an even stronger soft-soap and
    brassy effect. In reality I daily see in the gloomy huts
    effects against the light or in the evening twilight which are
    so curious that up to now my work appears too light for these
    effects, which I compare to soft soap and the brass colour of a
    worn-out 10-centime piece - faute de mieux, and paint them with
    those colours - faute de mieux. But I should like to succeed
    also with the sombre aspect I have often mentioned, &ldquo;le
    paysan, peint avec la terre qu'il ensemence.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I hope to send you this week a small box marked V2,
    containing:</p>

    <p>1 picture <art id=0083>la Chaumi&egrave;re [Hovel with thatched roof]</art></p>

    <p>1 watercolour id.[Painting lost]</p>

    <p>1 &ldquo; &ldquo; <art id=1230>vente pour cause de d&eacute;molition
    [Auction because of demolition]</art></p>

    <p>12 etudes peintes.</p>

    <p>Among the latter you will find a head which I had to paint
    after reading Germinal.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Did I tell you how she died?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;My woman over there in Russia.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&Eacute;tienne made a vague gesture, wondering at the
    trembling of the voice, and at this sudden need of confidence
    in this habitually reticent fellow, in his stoical detachment
    from others and from himself. He only knew that the woman was
    his mistress, and that she was hanged in Moscow.</p>

    <p>Souvarine resumed: &ldquo;The last day in the square, I was
    there&hellip;It was raining - the clumsy fellows lost their
    heads, upset by the pelting rain, they had taken twenty minutes
    to hang four others. She stood waiting. She did not see me, she
    was looking for me in the crowd. I got on top of a stone pillar
    and she saw me, our eyes never left each other. Twice I wanted
    to cry out, to hurl myself over the heads to join her. But what
    would have been the good of it? One man less, one soldier less;
    and I guessed that she was saying no with her big fixed eyes,
    when they met mine.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>You will find a variation among them - profile - a
    background of &ldquo;the flat plain of sugar-beet fields under
    the starless night, dark and thick like ink.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Standing out against this, <art id=0086>the head of a hercheuse or
    scl&ocirc;neuse with an expression as of a lowing cow, a person
    from: &ldquo;the countryside was pregnant with a race of men
    who grew, a black avenging army, germinating in the furrows,
    increasing for the harvest of future ages, and this germination
    would soon burst the earth.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>But that last expression is, I think, better in the study
    which I have signed, and which I made <i>before</i> I read it,
    <i>so without thinking of Germinal</i>, simply a peasant woman
    coming home from planting potatoes, all covered with dust from
    the field.</p>

    <p>I think I shall make a second picture of the cottage. The
    subject is so striking, those two half-mouldered cottages under
    one and the same thatched roof reminded me of an old couple,
    worn with age, who have grown into one being and are seen
    leaning on each other.</p>

    <p>For you see there are two cottages and a double chimney. In
    fact, what one sees here frequently.</p>

    <p>I can't spare the time, otherwise I should have much to say
    about Germinal, which I think splendid. Just one passage
    though: &ldquo;Bread! Bread! Bread! Fools, repeated Mr.
    Hennebeau, am <i>I</i> happy? A fit of anger rose within him
    against those people who did not understand. He would gladly
    have made them a present of his huge revenues if he could only
    have a tough skin like theirs and their easy indulgence without
    regrets. Oh, that he could not let them sit down at his table
    and stuff them with his pheasant, while he went out to
    fornicate behind the hedges, tumbling the girls without caring
    a rap about those who had tumbled them before him! He would
    have given everything, his education, his well-being, his
    luxury, his power as a director, if only he could have been for
    a single day the least of the wretches who obeyed him, master
    of his flesh, enough of a brute to slap his wife's face and
    take his pleasure with the women of the neighbourhood. He also
    wanted to starve, to enjoy an empty belly, his stomach twisted
    by cramps that staggered his brains by fits of dizziness;
    perhaps this would have killed the eternal pain. Ah! Live like
    a beast, having no possessions of his own, flattening the corn
    with the ugliest, dirtiest female coal trammer, and being able
    to find contentment in it. How stupid those hollow dreams of
    the revolutionaries were, they would increase the unhappiness
    of the earth, someday they would howl with despair when they
    had left behind the easy <i>satisfaction of their instincts</i>
    by raising them to the <i>unappeased</i> suffering of the
    passions.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As to what you write about Portier, &ldquo;He may be more of
    an enthusiast than a merchant,&rdquo; and as to your doubting
    whether he can do anything with my work, I think that neither
    you nor I nor he can decide this for the moment.</p>

    <p>But when you see him, tell him frankly that my idea is:
    when, after the sympathy he professed for my work, I try my
    utmost to send him work and thus remain consistent, I firmly
    count on his persevering in showing my work.</p>

    <p>Tell him my idea is that part of the public in Paris will
    not always remain the dupe of convention, however attractive it
    may be, but, on the contrary, things which have kept the dust
    of the cottages or of the fields most will find there some very
    faithful friends, though I cannot say why or how.</p>

    <p>So that he must not be easily discouraged, for neither you
    nor I would blame him if he did not succeed at once, but he
    must go on showing it and I shall go on sending.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">If he will write me his observations, I think they may be
    useful to me, and he must not hold them back. I must tell you
    that I sometimes long very much to see the Louvre and the
    Luxembourg again, and that sooner or later I shall have to
    study the technique and colour of Millet, Delacroix, Corot and
    others. But it is not immediately urgent; I think the more I
    work, the greater use it will be to me <i>when</i> it happens
    someday.</label></p>

    <p>But it is a fact that one needs both nature <i>and</i>
    pictures.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">It is especially that question of the colour scale in which
    they are painted, and the breaking and juxtaposition of the
    colours, which preoccupies me daily.</label></p>

    <p>Has Lhermitte's &ldquo;May&rdquo; appeared already?</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
