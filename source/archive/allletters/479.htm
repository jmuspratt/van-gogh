  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I must begin by telling you that the letter you did not get was wrongly addressed by me,
    and so came back. In a moment of absent-mindedness, just like me, I addressed it to Rue de Laval
    instead of Rue Lepic.</p>

    <p>That being so, I will repeat what was in the letter as though it just happened, the visit of
    McKnight, Russell's friend, who also came again last Sunday. I am to go to see him, and his work,
    of which I have so far seen nothing.</p>

    <p>He is a Yankee, and probably paints much better than most Yankees do, but a Yankee all the
    same.</p>

    <p>Have I said enough? When I have seen his pictures or drawings, I'll tell you what I think of
    his work. Meantime, so much for the man.</p>

    <p>The chief object of this letter is to find out if you have started and how. And afterward - oh!
    This afterward - perhaps you will hardly know yourself.</p>

    <p>Well, it seems that these Boussod Valadon people still don't give two straws for the judgement
    of the artists themselves.</p>

    <p>I can't deny that I felt it was bad news, and that I've been thinking about it - in spite of
    myself, I assure you - ever since.</p>

    <p>You see, I daren't go on in a line of things which are going to cost you more than they will
    bring in at present.</p>

    <p>For all these discussions with the B. V. people are rather
    an indication that impressionism hasn't taken on enough. As far
    as I'm concerned, I stopped painting at once, and went on with
    a series of pen drawings, of which you have had <art id=1516>the </art>first<art id=1414> two</art>
    but this time they are in a smaller size.</p>

    <p>For I said to myself that a quarrel with these people would
    mean that you must have fewer expenses on my account. Not being
    so keen as all that on my pictures, I could leave them alone
    without repining overmuch.</p>

    <p>Happily for me, I am not the sort of fellow who cares for
    nothing in the world but pictures.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, since I believe it's possible to produce a
    work of art at less cost than one must spend on a painting,
    I've begun the series of pen-and-ink drawings.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile I have some vexations, and I don't think I can get
    rid of them as long as I stay where I am. I would rather take a
    room or if needs be two rooms, one for sleeping, one for
    work.</p>

    <p><label content="fear.paranoia">For the people here are trying to take advantage of me so as
    to make me pay high for everything, on the pretext that I take
    up a little more room with my pictures than their other
    clients, who are not painters. On my side I shall make the most
    of the fact that I stay longer, and spend more in the inn than
    the workmen who come and go. And they won't find it easy to get
    so much as a cent out of me.</label></p>

    <p>But it's a perpetual nuisance to have to drag all one's apparatus and one's pictures after
    one, and it makes it harder both to go out and to come in.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">As I must make a move in any case, would you like it, or
    rather would it suit you better, if I went to Marseilles now?</label> I could do a series of
    marines there, like the series of orchards in bloom here.<label content="lifestyle.clothing">
    Also, I have bought three strong linen shirts and two pairs of stout shoes with the idea of moving.</label></p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">At Marseilles I'd make it more especially my business to get
    hold of a window to show the impressionist if you on your side could promise that you would
    provide me with impressionist pictures for it; supposing you were asked to show any - that
    will be easy enough.</label></p>

    <p>Sometimes I am seriously afraid that both you and I are
    going to be swindled by this B. V. &amp; Co. crew, with all the
    annoyance they're giving us. But I'm for fighting it out.</p>

    <p>Don't let them swindle you. That's enough for today; let me
    know your address if you go anywhere. When will you be in
    Holland? The same address for me, but I should like to move,
    for I'm not comfortable. I'll send you pen drawings in a little
    while; I've done four already.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I shall be very hard up by the end of the month, but I'll manage; it's just that I should
    like to be able to clear out at once, that's worrying me.</p>
