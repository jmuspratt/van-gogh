  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>If I did not give vent to my feelings every so often, then,
    I think, the boiler would burst.</p>

    <p>I must tell you something that, were I to keep it bottled up
    inside me, might distress me, but which, if I just come
    straight out with it, may turn out to be not so bad.</p>

    <p>As you know, Father and Mother on the one hand and I on the
    other do not see eye to eye about what should or should not be
    done with regard to a certain &ldquo;no, never,
    never.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, after I'd been listening to the fairly strong
    expressions, `indelicate and inopportune' for some considerable
    time (just imagine that you were in love and they called your
    love `indelicate', wouldn't you, with a certain amount of
    pride, take exception and say, Enough!'), at my urgent request
    that these expressions not be no longer used, they stopped, but
    only to come up with a new order of the day. Now they say that
    `I would be severing family ties.'</p>

    <p>Well, I have told them over and over again, seriously,
    patiently and with feeling, that this is not the case at all.
    This helped for a time, and then it started all over again. Now
    the complaint was that I kept 'writing letters'.</p>

    <p>And when - rashly and wantonly in my view - they kept using
    that wretched expression `severing ties,' I did the following.
    For a few days I said not a word and took no notice at all of
    Father and Mother. A contrecour [reluctantly], but I wanted
    them to see what it would be like if ties really had been
    severed.</p>

    <p>Of course they were amazed at my behavior, and when they
    said so, I replied, `You see, <i>that's what it would be
    like</i> if there were no tie of affection between us; but
    luckily there is one and it will not be broken so easily, but I
    beg you to appreciate how dreadful that phrase, &ldquo;severing
    ties&rdquo; really is, and not to use it any longer.' The
    result was, however, that Father grew very angry, ordered me
    out of the room, and, and cursed me, or at least that is
    exactly what it sounded like!</p>

    <p>Now while I am very distressed and sorry about it all, <i>I
    simply cannot agree</i> that a father who curses his son and
    (remember last year) proposes to send him to a lunatic asylum
    (which naturally I resisted with all my might) and who calls
    his son's love `inappropriate and indelicate' (!!!), is in the
    right.</p>

    <p>Whenever Father loses his <i>temper</i> he is used to having
    everyone, myself included, give in to him. However, I had made
    up my mind in God's name to let this fit of temper rage on for
    once.</p>

    <p><i>In anger</i> Father also said something about my having
    to move away somewhere else, but because it was said <i>in
    anger</i>, I do not attach much importance to it. I have my
    models and my studio here, elsewhere life would be more
    expensive, working more difficult and the models dearer. But if
    Father and Mother were coolly and calmly to tell me, `Go,' of
    course I should go.</p>

    <p>There are things a man simply <i>cannot</i> let pass. If one
    hears people saying `you are mad' or `you are someone who
    severs family ties' or `you are indelicate', then anyone with a
    heart in his body will protest with all his might. To be sure,
    I have told Father and Mother a thing or two as well, namely
    that they were quite wrong about this love of mine, that they
    had hardened their hearts, and seemed absolutely incapable of a
    gentler and more humane way of thinking. In a word, that to me
    their way of thinking seemed narrow-minded, neither full nor
    generous enough; and also that to me `God' would ring nothing
    but hollow if one had to hide one's love and were not allowed
    to follow the dictates of one's heart.</p>

    <p>Now I am quite ready to believe that there have been times
    when I have been unable to suppress my outrage upon hearing
    `indelicate' or `severing ties', but who would keep calm when
    that sort of thing never stops?</p>

    <p>Quoi qu'il en soit [be that as it may]. In his anger, Father
    muttered nothing more nor less than a curse. But then, I had
    already heard something of the sort last year, and thank God,
    far from being properly damned, felt new life and new energy
    springing up within me. And I firmly believe that it will be
    the same this time, only more so, and more forcefully than last
    year.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.love">Theo, I love her, her and no other, her forever. And, and,
    and, Theo, although the `no, never, ever' still "seems" to be
    in full sway, there is a feeling of something like redemption
    within me, and it is as if she and I had stopped being two and
    were united for all eternity.</label></p>

    <p><i>Have my drawings arrived?</i> I made another yesterday, a
    peasant boy in the morning lighting the fire in the hearth with
    a kettle hanging over it, and another, <art id=868>an old man laying
    kindling wood on the hearth</art>. I am sorry to say
    there is still something harsh and severe in my drawings, and I
    think that <i>she,</i> that is, her influence, is needed to
    soften that.</p>

    <p>Well, my dear fellow, it seems to me there is no reason to
    take 'the curse' so terribly hard. Perhaps I used too harsh a
    method to make Father and Mother feel something they did not
    want to hear, yet is not `a father's curse' a great deal
    stronger and harsher, going indeed a little too far? Enfin, je
    te serre la main, et crois-moi [Well, I shake your hand, and
    believe me],</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
