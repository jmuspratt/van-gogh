    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I have been so completely out of sorts mentally that it
    would have been useless to try to write an answer to your kind
    letter. Today I have just come home provisionally, I hope for
    good. I feel quite normal so often, and really I should think
    that if what I am suffering from is only a disease particular
    to this place, I must wait here quietly till it is over, even
    if it returns (and let's say that it won't).</label></p>

    <p>But this is what I told M. Rey once and for all. If sooner
    or later it is desirable that I go to Aix, as has already been
    suggested, I consent beforehand and I will submit to it.</p>

    <p>But in my character as a painter and a workman it is not
    permissible for anyone, not even you or a doctor, to take such
    a step without warning me and consulting me about it, also
    because since up till now I have always kept a comparative
    presence of mind in my work, I should have the right to say (or
    at least to have an opinion on) whether it would be better to
    keep my studio here or to move to Aix altogether. This so as to
    avoid the expenses and loss of moving as much as possible and
    not to do it except in case of absolute necessity.</p>

    <p>It seems that people here have some superstition that makes
    them afraid of painting, and that they have been talking about
    it in the town. Very good, I know it is the same thing in
    Arabia, but nevertheless we have loads of painters in Africa,
    haven't we?</p>

    <p>Which shows that with a little firmness you can modify these
    prejudices, at least as far as painting in spite of it is
    concerned.</p>

    <p>The unfortunate thing is that I am rather inclined to be
    affected by the beliefs of others, and to feel them myself, and
    I cannot always laugh at whatever foundation of truth there may
    be in the absurdity.</p>

    <p>As I have already been staying here for more than a year,
    and have heard almost all the ill that could be spoken of
    myself, Gauguin and painting in general - why shouldn't I take
    things as they come and wait for the upshot here? To what place
    worse could I go than where I have twice been: in the
    madhouse?</p>

    <p>The advantages I have here are what Rivet used to say,
    &ldquo;They are a sickly lot, all of them,&rdquo; so that at
    least I do not feel alone.</p>

    <p>Then, as you well know, I am so fond of Arles, though
    Gauguin has uncommonly good reason to call it the dirtiest town
    in the whole South.</p>

    <p>And I have already met with such friendliness from my
    neighbours, from M. Rey, and from everyone at the hospital
    besides, that really I would rather be always ill here than
    forget the kindness there is in the very people who have the
    most incredible prejudices against painters and painting, or at
    any rate have no clear, sane idea of it as we have.</p>

    <p>Then they know me now at the hospital, and if it comes on
    again, nothing would be said, and they would know what to do at
    the hospital. I have no desire at all to be treated by other
    doctors, nor is there any necessity.</p>

    <p>The only thing I should like to be able to do is go on
    earning with my hands what I spend. Koning wrote me a very nice
    letter saying that he and a friend would probably be coming
    South to me for a long time. It was in reply to a letter I
    wrote him some days ago. I do not dare persuade painters to
    come here after what has happened to me, they run the risk of
    losing their wits like me; the same applies to De Haan and
    Isa&auml;cson. Let them go to Antibes, Nice, or Mentone, it is
    perhaps healthier.</p>

    <p>Mother and our sister have also written, the latter was
    terribly distressed about the patient she was nursing. At home
    they are very, very glad about your marriage.</p>

    <p>Now mind, you must not think too much about me, nor fret
    yourself. It will probably have to take its course, and we
    cannot change much in our fate by taking precautions.</p>

    <p>Once more let us try to resign ourselves to our fate
    whatever it is. Our sister wrote that your fianc&eacute;e had
    just been staying some time at home. That is good. Well, I send
    my love with all my heart, and don't let's lose courage.</p>

    <p>Believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Address next letter to Place Lamartine.</p>

    <p>Kind regards to Gauguin. I hope he is going to write me. I
    shall write him too.</p>
