  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I still have to thank you for your letter of January 1, and
    the enclosure.</p>

    <p>With regard to being brotherly it would appear to me that
    this is dependent on taking the same view of things or not -
    which I pointed out to you - seeing that it seemed to me that
    perhaps our opinions were going to deviate considerably - if
    they haven't already. If I observed a deviation already (not
    simply imagined it), I repeat, I mention it because with you I
    do not want to pretend to be different from what I am, and
    because of the very fact that I do not want to quarrel. In the
    long run I should prefer to do without your support, however
    much your help means to me, to keeping it on condition that i
    act contrary to what I think is right. The more so because in
    later years, if we live to see them, it is possible that you
    will not continue really believing in what you now suppose to
    be unshakable. But this is not the point under discussion.</p>

    <p>As to what you say about my perhaps becoming quite isolated,
    I do not say that this will not happen, I expect little else,
    and shall be content if life remains possible and bearable for
    me.</p>

    <p>But I declare to you that I should not consider this a
    deserved fate, for I believe that after all I have never done,
    and shall never do, anything to make me lose the right to feel
    one with my fellow creatures.</p>

    <p>Others would be greatly to blame for it too. Well, I try to
    look at myself as if I were somebody else, that is to say,
    objectively, so that I try to see my own shortcomings as well
    as perhaps their compensations. And I know several stories of
    men who had to live relatively very isolated lives just because
    <i>neither of the two parties</i> found them exactly as they
    wanted them to be.</p>

    <p>There are two kinds of fellows who stand between the
    parties, firstly those who have no personal character, but
    secondly those who most decidedly have character but, as I
    said, who are not exactly what either one of the parties which
    have the say wants them to be.</p>

    <p>Isolation is bad enough, it is a kind of prison. To what
    extent I shall become so cannot be guessed now with any degree
    of certainty. Nor do you say so, in fact.</p>

    <p>I for my part often prefer to be with people who do not even
    know the world, for instance the peasants, the weavers, etc.,
    rather than being with those of the more civilized world. It's
    lucky for me.</p>

    <p>So since I have been here, for instance, I have been
    absorbed in the weavers.</p>

    <p>Do you know many drawings of weavers? I know only a very
    few. I began by making <art id=1114>three</art> watercolours of them.</p>

    <p>Those people are very hard to draw because one cannot take
    enough distance in those small rooms to draw the loom. I think
    that is the reason why so many drawings turn out failures. But
    I have found a room here where there are two looms, and where
    it can be done.</p>

    <p>In Drenthe, Rappard painted a study of it which I like very
    much. It is very gloomy - they are but poor creatures, those
    weavers. I have also made a drawing, just an impression, of a
    <art id=1113>lumber auction</art>.</p>

    <p>I wish you could understand that if at times I wish you had
    other thoughts about some questions than you have at present, I
    do so only because I believe you would profit by it, and not
    because I should want to make a proselyte for <i>my own
    opinions</i>. I do not believe my opinions to be better than
    those of other people. But more and more I begin to believe
    that there is something compared to which <i>all</i> opinions,
    mine included, become as nothing.</p>

    <p>Certain truths and facts, which our opinions can change
    little or not at all, and which I hope not to mistake for my or
    other people's opinions, as this would be an error on my
    part.</p>

    <p>Opinions can as little change certain standard truths as
    weathercocks can change the direction of the wind. The
    weathercocks do not make the wind east or north, nor can
    opinions make the truth true.</p>

    <p>I do not know whether you will understand me, but I wanted
    to make clear to you that I - thinking as I do - could hardly
    get cross with anyone merely on account of an <i>opinion</i>.
    Not counting my own <i>opinions</i> for much. But my not being
    able to resign myself to the fact that I see many persons lead
    a life, rather rashly I think, too far removed from what is
    <i>true for all</i> is quite another thing. So if I get cross,
    it might be because of something that has nothing whatever to
    do with my having a high opinion of myself.</p>

    <p>There are things as old as humanity itself, and which will
    not disappear in a hurry.</p>

    <p>I know of an old legend, I don't know of what people, which
    I love; of course it did not happen literally, but it is a
    symbol of many things.</p>

    <p>In that story, it is said that the human race descends from
    two brothers.</p>

    <p>These two were allowed to choose what they wanted above all
    things. The one chose gold, and the other chose the book.</p>

    <p>The first, who had chosen gold, became prosperous; but the
    second one fared poorly.</p>

    <p>The legend - without explaining exactly why - tells how the
    man with the book got banished to a cold and miserable country,
    and got <i>isolated</i>. But in his misery he started reading
    that book, and he learned things from it. So he managed to make
    his life more bearable, and invented several things to get out
    of his difficulties, so that at last he acquired a certain
    power, but always by working and struggling.</p>

    <p>Then afterward, just when he had become stronger with the
    book's help, the first one grew weaker; and so he lived long
    enough to learn that gold is <i>not</i> the axis round which
    <i>everything</i> turns.</p>

    <p>It is only a legend, but for me there is a depth in it which
    I find true.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The book&rdquo; does not mean <i>all</i> books or
    literature, it is at the same time conscience, reason, and it
    is art.</p>

    <p>Gold does not stand for money alone, but it is at the same
    time a symbol of several other things.</p>

    <p>But do not suppose that I want to force anything in this
    respect, these things must establish themselves.</p>

    <p>But saying a few words about things is different from
    forcing them - at certain moments keeping silent about
    something is nearly identical with dissimulation. I just did
    not want to do that.</p>

    <p>As for the rest, whether isolated or not, I will try to
    manage so that I can work on; and as to my opinions - I
    sometimes think of what Taine says, &ldquo;Il me semble que
    pour ce qui est du travailleur personallement, il peut garder
    &ccedil;a pour soi&rdquo; [It seems to me that as far as the
    worker is personally concerned, he can keep that to himself],
    so it was probably a mistake on my part not to keep things
    strictly to myself. And bear in mind that I do not want you to
    consider the help you give me as a thing you are obliged to do,
    for you were not obliged to do it in the past, nor are you now,
    it has been a voluntary thing on your part for which I, for my
    part, feel, and I repeat, shall certainly always feel, a real
    <i>obligation to you</i>.</p>

    <p>Wishing you success in your business,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>[On enclosed loose leaf]</p>

    <p>Once I read a remarkable saying somewhere about the
    possibility of becoming decidedly different in later life. In a
    biography of Corot I found the following observation on the
    influence he had on Fran&ccedil;ais. I read: &ldquo;&agrave;
    trente ans Fran&ccedil;ais ignorait ce que c'est qu'on ton
    neutre&rdquo; [at thirty F. did not know what a neutral tone
    was].</p>

    <p>I only want to say that until late in life one may have,
    surely as an artist no less than as a &ldquo;human being&rdquo;
    - until late in life one may have a certain stiff, rigid, let's
    say iron-like way of doing things, <i>and</i> of looking at
    things, <i>and</i> of working, too - but for all that one may
    gain, later on in life, gentler, more intelligent, more
    reasonable, more humane views.</p>

    <p>I only want to point out that it is quite possible that as a
    human being and as a workman you will acquire more of nature,
    more tranquillity, that you will get to be more &ldquo;your own
    self.&rdquo; I want to point out that now and then I do think
    you unnatural, for instance last summer in The Hague. At
    present this means nothing - and I don't in any way look upon
    this as your fixed and unchangeable character or state of mind,
    but as a curious phenomenon. Which I observe with interest and
    attention for the very reason that I myself have known moments
    of this state of mind just at a time when I was on the brink of
    a mental revolution. Ah, well&hellip;</p>

    <p>There is something else that I want to tell you about my
    talk with Father. I pointed out to Father that in my present
    condition and state of mind I sometimes think of going back to
    the woman I lived with - yes, that I might even decide to marry
    her. You should know, however - but Father need not know this -
    that up to the present I have not changed my mind about my
    decision that it would be impossible, and that living together
    again is out of the question.</p>

    <p>I mentioned it to Father in order to bring up again the
    question of the &ldquo;paternal right&rdquo; to prevent such a
    thing, a question put forward by Father himself. On this
    subject I said that Father's becoming my opponent in legal
    proceedings would in my opinion be anything but sensible.</p>

    <p>That moreover, in such a lawsuit it would be necessary to
    use trickery and false witnesses in order to give a semblance
    of justice to the obstruction of my intended marriage.</p>

    <p>That I for my part, if people should try to put obstacles in
    my way under such circumstances, should defend myself quite
    calmly and collectedly, insisting on my rights, and that I
    should never give in.</p>

    <p>Because I am convinced that it would be the kind of case in
    which the judge himself would urgently recommend an amicable
    settlement.</p>

    <p>Thus I spoke to Father about the matter of marrying, taking
    the woman with whom I lived as an example of what might happen.
    But mind you, in this matter I see no reason to go back on my
    resolution not to go and live with her again. A resolution that
    is known to her too.</p>

    <p>Before I could change my mind with regard to this matter, a
    great many things would have to happen, things that are quite
    out of the question at present. So now you know what I want you
    to know, but I have discussed the matter with Father with the
    object of making it clear that, if I should want to, Father
    would never be able to prevent it; that whatever may be said
    about a &ldquo;paternal right,&rdquo; I cannot find anything
    within the meaning of the law that would apply to me and could
    be used as an obstruction to me.</p>

    <p>Father has hinted at it so often, very vaguely but very
    palpably for all that, that I on my part decided to tell him
    flatly how absurd and coarse I should consider such a
    proceeding.</p>

    <p>It is a fact that now and then I think marriage would be a
    highly desirable thing for me, but as to this I nevertheless
    have no definite plans, certainly not as regards the woman I
    lived with.</p>
