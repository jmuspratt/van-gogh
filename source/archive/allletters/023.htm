  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Bravo, Theo. Your appreciation of that girl in &ldquo;Adam
    Bede&rdquo; is very good. That landscape in which the fallow,
    sandy path runs over the hill to the village, with its clay or
    whitewashed cottages, with moss-grown roofs, and here and
    there a black thornbush, on either side of the brown heath, and
    a gloomy sky over it, with a narrow white streak at the horizon
    - it is out of Michel.</p>

    <p>But there is a still purer and nobler sentiment in it than
    in Michel. Today I enclose, in the box we send, the little book
    containing poetry I spoke of. Also &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; by Renan
    and &ldquo;Joan of Arc&rdquo; by Michelet and also a portrait
    of Corot from the &ldquo;London News,&rdquo; which hangs in my
    room too.</p>

    <p>I do not think you have any immediate chance of being
    transferred to the house in London.</p>

    <p>Don't regret that your life is too easy, mine is rather easy
    too; I think that life is pretty long and that the time will
    arrive soon enough in which &ldquo;another shall gird thee and
    carry thee where thou wouldst not.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Adieu, remember me to all the friends. With a firm
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
