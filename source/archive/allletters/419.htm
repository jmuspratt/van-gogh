    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Just a line to welcome you. I wish it would be convenient
    for you to drop in with your friend Bonger this afternoon
    before dinner, let's say between 3 and 5.</p>

    <p>I thought this might be the best thing to do, as you will
    then be free to spend the whole evening at home.</p>

    <p>I am rather busy, as they are reaping the corn in the
    fields, for, as you know, this lasts only a few days, and it is
    one of the most beautiful things.</p>

    <p>But I will take care to be in the studio between 3 and
    5.</p>

    <p>In the evening I'll drop in at Mother's for a little
    talk.</p>

    <p>But for the rest, you must not be offended when I go on with
    my work.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
  </body>
