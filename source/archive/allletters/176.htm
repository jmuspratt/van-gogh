    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is now February 18 and I have not heard anything from you
    this month.<label content="Theo.health"> I thought you might perhaps be ill, because in your
    last letter you mentioned not feeling well. But Mr. Tersteeg
    told me that you were better, at least he was not aware of your
    being ill.</label></p>

    <p>As you can imagine, I am very hard pressed for money.<label content="business.sales"> Mr.
    Tersteeg bought a small drawing from me for 10 guilders, with
    which I managed this week.</label> But he wants them small and only in
    watercolour, and I do not always succeed in that. But at least
    the first sheep has crossed the bridge. I work as much as I
    can, but don't forget that I shall break down if I have too
    many cares and anxieties.</p>

    <p>So write by return mail, send me some money if you can, and
    believe me, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>This week I made three other studies beside the one Mr.
    Tersteeg bought; the technique is not perfect yet, but, thank
    God, the drawing is better.</p>

    <p>I am very glad that I feel my drawing is improving, it gives
    me courage. Drawing is the principal thing, whatever they may
    say, and it is the most difficult too. It is for this reason
    that I venture to say I shall make something saleable within a
    year. For the one Mr. Tersteeg bought does not count - I shall
    make them much better when I have made more progress in
    drawing, as then it will come more easily to me.</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, do write soon!</p>
