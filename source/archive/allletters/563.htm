  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Gauguin's canvas, &ldquo;Breton Children,&rdquo; has arrived
    and he has altered it very well.</p>

    <p>But though I quite like this canvas, it is all to the good
    that it is sold, and the two he is about to send you from here
    are thirty times better. I am speaking of the &ldquo;Women
    Gathering Grapes&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Woman with the
    Pigs.&rdquo; The reason for this is that Gauguin is beginning
    to get over that disorder of the liver or the stomach which has
    been tormenting him lately.</p>

    <p>But I am now writing to reply to what you said about having
    <art id=0404>a little canvas of mine of a pink peach tree framed</art>, I imagine
    to send to <i>ces messieurs</i>. I don't want to leave any
    doubt as to what I think of that.</p>

    <p>First, if it is your wish to let them have something of
    mine, good or bad, upon my honour if it can in any way give you
    any pleasure now or later, you have absolute carte blanche.</p>

    <p>But if it is either to please me, <i>or for my own
    advantage</i>, then on the contrary I'm of the opinion that it
    is absolutely unnecessary.</p>

    <p>If you had asked me what would please me, it's just this one
    thing: that you keep in the apartment for yourself whatever you
    like out of my work, and sell none of it now.</p>

    <p>As for the rest, send whatever is in your way back to me
    here, for the good reason that all the things I have done from
    nature are chestnuts pulled out of the fire.</p>

    <p>Gauguin, in spite of himself and in spite of me, has more or
    less proved to me that it is time I was varying my work a
    little. I am beginning to compose from memory, and all my
    studies will still be useful for that sort of work, recalling
    to me things I have seen. What then does selling matter, unless
    we are absolutely pressed for money?</p>

    <p>And besides, I am convinced beforehand that you will end up
    seeing it the way I do.</p>

    <p>You are with the Goupils, but I most certainly am not; after
    having worked with them for six <i>years</i>, both sides were
    utterly dissatisfied, they with me, I with them. It's an old
    story, but all the same, that's how things were.</p>

    <p>So go your own way, but as a matter of business I think it
    is incompatible with my previous conduct to come back to them
    with a canvas as innocent as this little peach tree or
    something similar.</p>

    <p><i>No</i>. If in a year or two I have enough for an
    exhibition of my own, say thirty size 30 canvases or so, and if
    I said to them, &ldquo;Will you do it for me?&rdquo; Boussod
    would certainly send me about my business. I know them, alas,
    rather too well, and I think I shall not apply to them. Not
    that I should ever try to do them any harm whatever - on the
    contrary, you will have to admit that I urge all the others to
    go there, with great zeal.</p>

    <p>But as far as I'm concerned, I still carry that old
    grudge.</p>

    <p>Understand quite clearly that I consider you a dealer in
    impressionist pictures, completely independent of the Goupils,
    so that it will always be a pleasure to me to push artists in
    that direction.</p>

    <p>But I do not want Boussod to ever have a chance to say,
    &ldquo;That little canvas isn't too bad for a young
    beginner.&rdquo; On the contrary, I will not go back to them, I
    would rather never sell anything than go to them otherwise than
    as a purely business matter. Now they are not the people to
    behave fairly, so it's no good beginning again.</p>

    <p>Understand that the more clear-cut we are about this, the
    sooner they will come to you to see them. You yourself do not
    sell my work, so you are not doing business outside the firm of
    Boussod V. &amp; Co. by showing it. So you will be acting quite
    correctly, which is always decent.</p>

    <p>However, should someone or other want to buy, very good,
    then they have only to apply directly to me. But be sure of
    this, if we can stand the siege, my time will come. I cannot do
    anything but work just now, nor should I.</p>

    <p>A handshake - we need some more paints.</p>

    <p>I must also tell you that this month with the two of us
    together is going better on 150 francs than on 250 for myself
    alone. At the end of a year you will see how things have
    developed.</p>

    <p>I cannot say any more.</p>

    <p>I am rather sorry to have my room full of canvases, and to
    have nothing to send when Gauguin sends his.</p>

    <p>It is because Gauguin has told me how to get rid of the
    grease in the things painted in impasto by washing from time to
    time.</p>

    <p>And then when that is done, I must go over them to retouch
    them.</p>

    <p>If I sent them to you now, the colours would be duller than
    they will be later.</p>

    <p>They all think what I have sent too hastily done. I do not
    contradict it, and I will make some alterations.</p>

    <p>It does me a tremendous amount of good to have such
    intelligent company as Gauguin's, and to see him work.</p>

    <p>You will see that some people will soon be reproaching
    Gauguin with no longer being an impressionist.</p>

    <p>His last two canvases, which you will soon be seeing, are
    very firm in the impasto, there is even some work with the
    palette knife. And they will throw his Breton canvases a little
    in the shade - not all, but some.</p>

    <p>I have hardly any time to write. But for that, I should
    already have written to these Dutchmen. I have had another
    letter from Bock, you know, the Belgian who has a sister among
    the &ldquo;Vingtistes&rdquo;; he is enjoying his work up
    there.</p>

    <p>I hope we shall always remain friends with Gauguin and doing
    business with him, and if he could succeed in founding a studio
    in the tropics, it would be magnificent. However, it requires
    more money according to my calculations than it does according
    to his.</p>

    <p>Guillaumin has written to Gauguin. He seems to be very hard
    up, but he must have done some fine things. He has a child now
    but he was <i>terrified</i> by the confinement, and he says
    that he has the red vision of it always before his eyes. But to
    this Gauguin aptly replied that he himself has seen it six
    times.</p>

    <p>Jet Mauve is much better as far as her health is concerned,
    and as you perhaps know, she has been staying in The Hague
    since last August, near the Jewish cemetery, and therefore
    almost in the country.</p>

    <p>You will lose nothing by waiting a little for my work, and
    we will calmly leave our comrades to despise the present ones.
    Fortunately for me, I know well enough what I want, and am
    basically utterly indifferent to the criticism that I work too
    hurriedly. In answer to that, I have done some things <i>even
    more</i> hurriedly these last few days.</p>

    <p>Gauguin was telling me the other day that he had seen a
    picture by Claude Monet of sunflowers in a large Japanese vase,
    very fine, but - he likes mine better. I don't agree - only
    don't think that I am weakening.</p>

    <p>I regret - as always, how well you know - the scarcity of
    models and the thousand obstacles in overcoming that
    difficulty. If I were a different sort of man, and if I were
    better off, I could force the issue, but as it is I do not give
    in, but plod on quietly.</p>

    <p>If, by the time I am forty, I have done a picture of figures
    like the flowers Gauguin was speaking of, I shall have a
    position in art equal to that of anyone, no matter who. So,
    perseverance.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile I can at all events tell you that the last two
    studies are odd enough.</p>

    <p>Size 30 canvases, <art id=0498>a wooden rush-bottomed chair all yellow on
    red tiles against a wall (daytime).</art></p>

    <p>Then <art id=0499>Gauguin's armchair, red and green night effect, wall
    and floor red and green again, on the seat two novels and a
    candle, on thin canvas with a thick impasto.</art></p>

    <p>What I say about sending back the studies is not in the
    least urgent, and I mean the bad ones, which will still be
    useful to me as documents, or the ones which are cluttering up
    your apartment.</p>

    <p>And as for what I said in general about the studies, there
    is just one thing I am set on: let the position be quite clear,
    don't make any deal for me outside your own house. As far as I
    am concerned, I shall either never darken the Goupil's door
    again, which is probable, or else I shall go in boldly, which
    is hardly likely.</p>

    <p>Good-by again, and thank you for all you do for me.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
