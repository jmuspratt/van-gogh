    <p>[From Vincent van Gogh by Gustave Cocquiot. Ollendorf,
    Paris, 1932, p. 194. See letters 581 and 583a]</p>

    <p>Yet Paul Signac courageously went to see him. Here is the
    account of this visit:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The last time I saw Vincent,&rdquo; he told us,
    &ldquo;was in Arles in the spring of 1889. Then he was already
    in that town's asylum.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A few days before [sic] he had cut off the lobe of
    his ear [and not his whole ear] under the circumstances you
    know of. [Mrs. J. van Gogh-Bonger on her part also affirms that
    only the lobe of the ear was cut off.] <label content="health.mental">But on the day of my
    visit he was quite sane, and the house physician gave me
    permission to go out with him.</label> He had the famous bandage around
    his head and wore his fur cap. He led me to his apartments in
    Lamartine Square, where I saw his marvellous pictures, his
    masterpieces: Les Alyscamps <sup>1</sup>, the Night
    Caf&eacute;, La Berceuse, the Lock, the Saintes-Maries,
    the Starry Night, etc. Imagine the splendour of those
    whitewashed walls, on which flowered those colourings in their
    full freshness.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Throughout the day he spoke to me of painting,
    literature, socialism. In the evening he was a little tired.
    There had been a terrific spell of mistral, and this may have
    enervated him. He wanted to drink about a quart of essence of
    turpentine from the bottle that was standing on the table in
    the room. It was high time to return to the asylum.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Next day I went to take leave of him; I went to
    Cassis; there he sent me a nice letter full of art and
    friendship, telling me how much pleasure my visit had afforded
    him, and illustrated with a fine drawing [two, to be
    exact].</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I never saw him again.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>1. Literally &ldquo;Elysian Fields,&rdquo; an avenue in
    Arles skirting a Roman cemetery.</p>
