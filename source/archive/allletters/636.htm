  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo and Jo,</p>

    <p>In the other letter I forgot to give you the address
    here, which is temporarily Place de la Mairie, chez Ravoux.
    Besides, when I wrote to you, I had not yet made anything. Now I
    have <art id=0750>one study of old thatched roofs with a field of peas in
    flower in the foreground and wheat, background of hills,</art>. A
    study which I think you will like. And I
    already feel that it did me good to go South, the better to see
    the North.</p>

    <p>It is as I thought, I see more violet hues wherever they
    are. Auvers is decidedly very beautiful.</p>

    <p>So much so that I think it will pay better to work than not
    to work, <i>in spite of all the bad luck with the paintings that
    may be expected.</i></p>

    <p>It is very colourful here - but there are such
    pretty bourgeois country houses, much prettier than Ville
    d'Avray, etc., to my thinking. Seems that Desmoulins, the
    man who did Japan, was here, but has gone. So if you
    can send me some money toward the end of the week, what I have
    will last me till then, but I haven't any for a longer
    time.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">I would also ask you for 10 meters of canvas if it does
    not inconvenience you; but if, seeing that it is near the end
    of the month, it should inconvenience you, would you send 20
    sheets of Ingres paper.</label></p>

    <p>These I need in any case so as not to waste time.
    There is a lot to draw here. Dear fellow, having thought it
    over, I do not say that my work is good, but the thing is that
    I can do less bad stuff. Everything else, relations with
    people, is very secondary, because I haven't the gift for that.
    I can't help that.</p>

    <p>Not working or working less would cost double,
    that is all I can see. <i>If</i> we look for another road to success
    than the natural road of work - which we shall hardly do. Look
    here, if I work, people here are just as likely to come to my
    house without my going to see them purposely as if I took steps
    to make acquaintances.</p>

    <p>It is by working that you meet people, and that is the best
    way. Besides, I am quite convinced that this is your opinion
    and Jo's too. I can do nothing about my illness.<label content="health.general"> I am suffering
    a little just now - the thing is that after that long seclusion
    the days seem like weeks to me.</label></p>

    <p>I felt that in Paris and here too, but serenity will come as
    my work gets on a bit. However that may be, I do not regret
    being back, and things will go better here. I'll be very glad
    if some time from now you were to come here one Sunday with
    your family.</p>

    <p>You will see clearly that in order to come to understand the
    country and the way of life, seeing other countries as all to
    the good.</p>

    <p>But I find the modern villas and the bourgeois country
    houses almost as pretty as the old thatched cottages which are
    falling into ruin. Mmes. Daubigny and Daumier, they say, are
    still staying here, at least I am sure that the former is.</p>

    <p>When you can, you might send me Bargue's Exercises au fusain
    for a while. I need it urgently, I will copy them so as to keep
    the copies for good.</p>

    <p>Very hearty handshakes,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
