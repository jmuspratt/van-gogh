  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I got your telegraph order for 50 francs on Monday morning,
    and thank you very much for it. Only I have not received your
    letter yet, and I am rather surprised.</p>

    <p>I have had a letter from Gauguin, who says he got a letter
    from you with 50 Fr. enclosed, which touched him greatly, and
    in which you said something of the plan. As I had sent you my
    letter to him, he had not yet received the more definite
    proposal when he wrote.</p>

    <p>But he says that he knows from experience, because when he
    was with this friend Laval in Martinique they managed much
    better together than when they were alone, so that he quite
    agreed with me as to the advantages there would be in living
    together.</p>

    <p>He says that the pains in his bowels still continue, and he
    seems to me to be very depressed.</p>

    <p>He speaks of some hopes he has of finding a capital of
    600,000 francs to set up as a dealer in impressionist pictures,
    and that he will explain his plan, and would like you to head
    the enterprise. I should not be surprised if this hope is a
    fata morgana, a mirage of destitution, the more destitute you
    are - especially if you are ill - the more you think of such
    possibilities. To me this scheme simply looks like another
    proof of his breaking down, and it would be better to get him
    away as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>He says that when sailors have to move a heavy load, or
    weigh anchor, so as to be able to lift a very heavy weight, and
    to make a huge effort, they all sing together to keep them up
    to the mark and give them vim.</p>

    <p>That is just what artists lack! So I should be very much
    surprised if he is not glad to come, but in addition to the
    hotel and travelling expenses, there is the doctor's bill as
    well, so it will be pretty steep.</p>

    <p>But I think he ought to leave the debts unpaid, giving some
    pictures as security - if he is coming here, and if the people
    do not agree to that, to leave the debts as they are, without
    pictures as security. I was obliged to do the same thing to get
    to Paris, and though I lost a lot of things, it cannot be
    helped in a case like this, and it is better to get away no
    matter how than to go to rack and ruin where you are.</p>

    <p>I have not gone to Saintes-Maries; they have finished
    painting the house, and I have had to pay for that, and then I
    had to get in a fairly big stock of canvases; so out of 50
    francs I have got one louis left, and it is only Tuesday
    morning, so it was hardly possible for me to go, and I am
    afraid next week will be just as bad.</p>

    <p>I was glad to hear that Mourier has come to stay with
    you.</p>

    <p>If Gauguin would rather take the risk of going into business
    again, and if he really hopes to do something in Paris, Good
    Lord! let him go, but I think that he would be wise to come
    here at least for a rest; there is someone here who has been to
    Tonkin, and came back ill from that delightful place - he has
    recovered here.</p>

    <p>I have two or three new drawings, and two or three new
    painted studies too.</p>

    <p>One day I went to Tarascon, but unfortunately there was such
    a blazing sun and so much dust that day that I came back with
    an empty bag. I have heard of two Monticellis in Marseilles, a
    bunch of flowers at 250 francs, and some figures. It was that
    friend of Russell's McKnight, who had seen them there. I should
    very much like to go to Marseilles sometime.</p>

    <p>I keep on finding very beautiful and interesting subjects
    here, and in spite of the worry about the expense, I think that
    there is a better chance in the South than in the North.</p>

    <p>If you saw the Camargue and many other places, you would be
    surprised, just as I was, to find that they are exactly in
    Ruysdael's style.</p>

    <p>I am working on a new subject,<art id=0412> fields green and yellow as
    far as the eye can reach</art>. I have <art id=1484>already </art>drawn
    it<art id=1483> twice</art>, and I
    am starting it again as a painting; it is exactly like a
    Salomon Konink - you know, the pupil of Rembrandt who painted
    vast level plains. Or it is like Michel, or like Jules
    Dupr&eacute; - but anyway it is very different from rose
    gardens. It is true that I have only been through one part of
    Provence, and that in the other part there is the kind of
    scenery that you get in Claude Monet, for instance.</p>

    <p>I am very curious to know how Gauguin will get on. He says
    that he disposed of thirty-five thousands' worth of
    impressionist stuff at Durand Ruel's in his time, and that he
    hopes to do the same for you. But it is so wretched when your
    health begins to bother you. I think myself that the most solid
    asset Gauguin has now is his painting, and the best business he
    could do - his own pictures. Probably he has written you
    already. I replied to his letter last Saturday.</p>

    <p>I think it would come very heavy to pay all that he owes,
    and the journey, etc., etc. <i>If Russell bought a picture from
    him</i>, but he has the house that he is building, which leaves
    him short of money. I think, however, that I shall write too
    that effect. I have to send him something myself for our
    exchange, and if Gauguin wants to come, then I could ask him
    quite confidently. It is quite certain that if one could buy
    his pictures at their present price in exchange for the money
    given Gauguin, there would be no risk of losing money. I should
    very much like you to have all his pictures of Martinique.
    Well, let's do what we can. With a handshake, I hope you will
    write soon.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>What is the bust of a woman by Rodin in the Salon? It cannot
    be the bust of Mrs. Russell, he must be working on that now
    though.</p>

    <p>Hasn't my friend Mourier a lordly accent? Bropaply he sdill
    trinks gognac mit vatter?</p>
