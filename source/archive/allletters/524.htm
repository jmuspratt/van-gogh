    <p>Letter 524<br>
     Arles, c. 14 August 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I spent yesterday evening with the 2<sup>nd</sup>
    lieutenant; he expects to leave here on Friday, then he will
    stop a night at Clermont, and from Clermont he will send you a
    wire to tell you by what train he will arrive Sunday morning.
    The roll he is bringing contains 35 studies, among which there
    are many I am desperately dissatisfied with, but which I am
    sending anyway, since at all events they will give you a vague
    idea of the very fine subjects there are in this country.</p>

    <p>For instance, there is <art id=0448>a rough sketch I made of myself laden
    with boxes, props, and canvas on the sunny road to Tarascon</art>. There is <art id=0426>a view
    of the Rhone in which the sky and the water are the colour of absinthe, with a blue bridge and
    figures of little black urchins</art>; there is <art id=0422>the sower</art>, and <art id=0427>a
    washing place</art>, and others as well, which have not come off at all and are unfinished,
    especially one big landscape with brushwood.</p>

    <p>What has happened to <art id=0394>the Souvenir de Mauve</art>? Not having heard
    any word about it, I have been inclined to think that Tersteeg
    must have said something disagreeable to you about it, to the
    effect that it would be refused, or some such unpleasantness.
    Needless to say, I shan't fret over it if this is so.</p>

    <p>Just now I am working on a study like this</p>

    <p>[<art id=640_V-T_5240>Here appears the sketch of "Men Loading Boats."</art>]</p>

    <p>of <art id=0449>boats seen from the quay above, the two boats are pink
    tinged with violet, the water is bright green, no sky, a
    tricolour on the mast. A workman with a barrow
    is unloading sand</art>. I have <art id=1462>a drawing of it as well</art>.</p>

    <p>Have you received the three drawings of the garden? In the
    end they'll refuse to take any more of them at the post office,
    because they are too big.</p>

    <p>I am afraid that I shall not get a rather beautiful model;
    she promised, but then - as it appears - picked up some change
    by going on a long weekend, and now has something better to do.
    She was extraordinary, the expression like that one by
    Delacroix, the figure primitive and strange.</p>

    <p>I endure these things with patience, failing any other way
    of bearing them, but this continual difficulty with models is
    maddening. One of these days I hope to make a study of
    oleanders. If I painted prettily like Bouguereau, people would
    not be ashamed to let themselves be painted, but I think that I
    have lost models because they thought that they were
    &ldquo;badly done,&rdquo; because &ldquo;it was only pictures
    full of painting&rdquo; that I did. The poor little souls are
    afraid of being compromised and that people will laugh at their
    portraits. But it is almost enough to make you lose heart when
    you think that you could do something if people had more good
    will. I cannot resign myself to saying - &ldquo;sour
    grapes&rdquo; -it does not console me for not having more
    models.</p>

    <p>Well, I must have patience and look around again for
    others.</p>

    <p>Our sister will soon be coming now to spend some time with
    you. I am sure she will enjoy herself.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">It is a gloomy enough prospect to have to say to myself that
    perhaps the painting I am doing will never be of any value
    whatever. If it was worth what it cost to do, I could say,
    &ldquo;I never bothered my head about money.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But as things are, on the contrary it absorbs me. But there
    it is, and anyhow I must go on and try to do better.</label></p>

    <p>Very often I think that it would be wiser to go to Gauguin,
    instead of recommending the life here to him. I am so afraid
    that after all he will complain of having been upset. Would it
    really be possible for us to live at home here, and could we
    make both ends meet, seeing that it is a new experiment? We can
    figure what it would cost in Brittany, whereas I haven't the
    slightest idea about here. I still find life pretty expensive,
    and you don't get anywhere complaining to the people here. Beds
    and some furniture would have to be bought here, and then there
    would be the cost of his journey and everything he owes.</p>

    <p>It seems to me to be risking more than we ought, when
    Bernard and he spend so little in Brittany. Anyway, we must
    decide soon, and I for my part have no preference. It is simply
    a question of deciding where we have the best likelihood of
    living cheaply. I must write Gauguin today to ask him what he
    pays for models, and if he has any.</p>

    <p>You see, when one is getting old, one must really rule out
    illusions, and count the cost before embarking on things. And
    if when one is younger one can believe that it's possible to
    get a living by unremitting work, it becomes more and more
    doubtful now. I already told Gauguin in my last letter that if
    we painted like Bouguereau we could hope to make money by it,
    but that the public will never change, and it likes only easy,
    pretty things. With a more austere talent, you cannot count on
    profit from your work; most of the people intelligent enough to
    like and understand impressionist pictures are and will remain
    too poor to buy them. Will Gauguin or I work the less for that?
    - no - but we shall be forced to submit deliberately to poverty
    and social isolation. And to begin with, let's settle down
    where life costs the least. If success comes, so much the
    better, so much the better if we find ourselves in easier
    circumstances someday.</p>

    <p>What touches me most deeply in Zola's L'&OElig;uvre is the
    figure of Bongrand-Jundt. What he says is so true. &ldquo;You
    think, you poor souls, that when an artist has established his
    talent and his reputation, he is safe. On the contrary,
    henceforth he is denied producing anything which is not
    perfect. His reputation itself forces him to take more pains
    over his work, as the chances of selling grow fewer. At the
    least sign of weakness, the whole jealous pack will fall on him
    and destroy that very reputation and the faith that the
    changeable and treacherous public has temporarily had in
    him.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Even stronger than this is what Carlyle says &ldquo;You know
    the glowworms in Brazil that shine so that in the evening
    ladies stick them into their hair with pins; well, fame is a
    fine thing, but look you, to the artist it is what the hairpin
    is to the insects.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You want to succeed and shine, but do you know what
    it is you desire?&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">So I have a horror of success, I am afraid of &ldquo;the
    morning after the night before&rdquo; of an impressionist
    success, even these difficult days will later seem to us
    &ldquo;the good old times!&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>Well, Gauguin and I must look ahead, we must contrive to
    have a roof over our heads, beds, in short, the absolute
    necessities, to stand the siege of failure which will <i>last
    all our lives</i> and we must settle down in the cheapest
    place. Then we shall get the quiet which is necessary if we are
    to produce much, even if we sell little or nothing.</p>

    <p>But if our expenses exceed our income, we should be mistaken
    if we hoped that all could be put right by selling our
    pictures. On the contrary, we should be obliged to get rid of
    them at any price and at the wrong moment.</p>

    <p>To conclude, we must live almost like monks or hermits, with
    work for our master passion, and surrendering our ease.</p>

    <p><i>Nature and fine weather</i> are the advantages of the
    South; but I think that Gauguin will never give up the fight in
    Paris, he has it too much at heart, and believes in a lasting
    success more than I do. That will do me no harm; on the
    contrary, perhaps I am too pessimistic. Let's leave him this
    illusion then, but let's realize that what he will always need
    is his daily bread and shelter and paints. That is the crack in
    his armour, and it is because he is getting into debt now that
    he will be knocked out in advance.</p>

    <p>If we two come to his aid, we are in fact making his victory
    in Paris possible.</p>

    <p>If I had the same ambitions as he, we probably should not
    agree. But I neither care about success for myself nor about
    happiness; I do care about the permanence of this vigorous
    attempt by the impressionists, I do care about this question of
    shelter and daily bread for them. And I think it's a crime that
    I should have it when two could live on the same money.</p>

    <p>If you are a painter, they think you are either a fool or a
    rich man; a cup of milk costs you a franc, a slice of bread
    two, and meanwhile your pictures are not selling. That is what
    makes it necessary to combine as the old monks did, and the
    Moravian Brothers of our Dutch heaths.</p>

    <p>I can already see that Gauguin is hoping for success, he
    cannot do without Paris, he does not realize the
    <i>eternity</i> of poverty. You understand that under the
    circumstances it is all the same to me whether I stay or go. We
    must let him fight his battle, he is sure to win. He would feel
    that he was doing nothing if he were too far from Paris, but
    for our own part let's keep our utter indifference to success
    or failure.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I had begun to sign canvases, but I soon stopped, because it
    seemed too foolish. On one marine there is an excessively red
    signature, because I wanted a red note in the green.</label> But you
    will see them soon. The end of the week will be a little
    difficult, so I hope to get your letter a day earlier rather
    than a day late.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
