  <body>
    <p>My dear comrade Bernard,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter, but I am somewhat surprised to hear
    you say, &ldquo;Oh, impossible to do Gauguin's portrait!&rdquo;
    Why impossible? What nonsense is this! I won't insist, and we
    won't say another word about this exchange once and for all.
    <sup>1</sup> So, on his part too Gauguin hasn't even thought of
    doing yours. And such fellows call themselves portraitists;
    living so long together and not making up their minds to pose
    for each other, and they will separate without having painted
    each other's portrait! All right, I won't insist. And I repeat,
    there is no longer any question of an exchange.</p>

    <p>Well then, I hope someday to paint your portrait and
    Gauguin's myself, as soon as we get together, which is bound to
    happen.</p>

    <p>In short, I think that I am going to do <art id=0473>the portrait of the
    second lieutenant of the Zouaves whom I told you about, and who
    is on the point of leaving for Africa.</art></p>

    <p>Why haven't you replied with a single word to my question
    about your intentions with regard to your military service?</p>

    <p>Now let's speak for a moment about your saying that you are
    thinking of coming here and spending the winter in Arles. I
    have expressly installed myself in such a way that I can put
    somebody up if necessary. But what if Gauguin comes? He has not
    definitely declined the offer yet; but even if I could take you
    in, I don't see how you could feed yourself well at less than 3
    francs a day, and I should prefer to say 4 francs.</p>

    <p>Of course, if we were hard up, we could have a lot of cheap
    meals in the studio; one can certainly always economize in this
    way. But I tell you, life here is a little more expensive than
    at Pont-Aven. I think you are only paying 2.50 francs a day -
    aren't you? - board, lodging and everything included. And if -
    what would tempt you the most - you were going to paint in the
    brothels - which is most certainly excellent - it can't be done
    free for nothing here!</p>

    <p>So let it go until you have your uniform; in this respect
    soldiers - here and elsewhere - can get a lot of things free
    for nothing.</p>

    <p>Take my own case, it is true that I have just done that
    study of <art id=0463>the &ldquo;Night Caf&eacute;,&rdquo; </art>but nevertheless, though it
    is a free-love hotel, where from time to time you may see a
    whore sitting at a table with her fellow, I myself have not
    been able to do a brothel in the exact sense of the word, just
    because if I were to do it a little satisfactorily and
    seriously, it would cost me more money than I can possibly
    afford. So I refrain from starting that picture until I feel
    strong enough financially to bring it off. Now listen, I don't
    want to say that we shan't go and have a glass of beer there;
    we shall make acquaintances there, we shall work partly from
    imagination, partly from the model. And if we should want to, I
    don't say it would be impossible to do it, but at present I for
    one am in no hurry at all. Plans so often fall through, however
    well the calculations are made, whereas by relying on chance
    and working from day to day, without any fixed purpose, one
    does a lot of unexpected things.</p>

    <p>So I cannot possibly recommend to you to come here for the
    express purpose - undoubtedly excellent in itself - of painting
    brothels. I repeat, once you are a soldier you will have a
    splendid opportunity for that, and it would probably be as well
    for your own sake to wait until you have your uniform. But, my
    dear comrade Bernard, the thing I want to say to you clearly
    and frankly is, Go spend your time in Africa. The South will
    charm you and make a great artist out of you. Gauguin himself
    owes his superiority to the South. I myself have now seen the
    stronger sunlight here for months, and the result is that,
    after this experience, those who maintain their position best
    from the point of view of colour are Delacroix and Monticelli;
    those painters of whom it is said erroneously nowadays that
    they are pure romantics, fellows with an exaggerated
    imagination. In short, you see, the South which is painted so
    dryly by G&eacute;r&ocirc;me and Fromentin is from here [Arles]
    on already essentially a country whose intimate charm can be
    interpreted only by the colour of the colourist.</p>

    <p>I hope you will write me again soon.</p>

    <p>I wouldn't venture to take it upon myself to urge anyone to
    come here. If someone comes here of his own accord, well,
    that's his own business; but as for recommending it, I'll never
    do that. As for me, I'll stay here, and of course I should be
    pleased if you were to spend the winter here.</p>

    <p>A handshake.</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Vincent</p>
