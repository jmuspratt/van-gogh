  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is time that you heard from me again.</p>

    <p>You must know that Rappard has been here for about twelve
    days, and now he has gone. Of course, he sends his best
    regards. We have taken many long walks together - have been,
    for instance, several times to the heath, near Seppe, to the
    so-called Passievaart, a big swamp. There Rappard painted a
    large study (1 meter by 50cm.) in which there was much that was
    good. Beside that, he did about ten small sepias, also in the
    Liesbosch.</p>

    <p>While he was painting, I made a drawing in pen and ink of
    another <art id=845>spot in the swamp</art>, where all the water
    lilies grow (near the road to Roozendaal). We also went to
    Prinsenhage together, but Uncle was ill in bed again. I think
    Rappard makes progress in his work. From what he told me, he
    has got a nicely furnished studio at home. Now this week he is
    going to Loosdrecht, where he intends to stay a month. He too
    works <i>regularly</i> and hard.</p>

    <p>I bought Cassagne's Trait&eacute; d'Aquarelle and am
    studying it; even if I should not make any watercolours, I
    shall probably find many thing in it, for instance, about sepia
    and ink. For until now I have drawn exclusively in pencil
    accented and worked up by the pen, sometimes a reed pen, which
    has a broader stroke. What I have been doing lately demanded
    that way of working, because the subjects required much
    <i>drawing</i> - drawing in perspective, too, for instance, a
    few workshops in the village here, a forge, a carpenter's shop
    and the workshop of a maker of wooden shoes.</p>

    <p>Willemien has left now, and I am sorry; she poses very well
    - I made <art id=849>a drawing of her</art> and of another girl who stayed here.
    I put a sewing machine into that drawing. Nowadays
    there are no more spinning wheels, and it is a great pity for
    painters and draughtsmen; but something has come in its place
    that is no less picturesque, and that is the sewing
    machine.</p>

    <p>What about your coming here this summer, is there any chance
    of its really happening? I hope so.</p>

    <p>Rappard seems to have a boat of his own there at Loosdrecht;
    that must be fine.</p>

    <p>From Loosdrecht he intends to go to Gelderland.</p>

    <p>He would very much like to meet you, and I promised him that
    if you came and I knew it beforehand, I should let him know,
    because he would then try to arrange to meet you.</p>

    <p>I do not know whether he intends to go back to Paris; he did
    not speak of it at all. Nor do I know if this is a sign that he
    does not think about it, or that, on the contrary, il couve son
    projet [he hatches his plans]. When I think that he is only
    twenty-three years old, and more things of that sort, I should
    not be surprised if the latter were the case.</p>

    <p>I hope you will write me if you can spare a moment. If you
    could by any chance send me the Salon's catalogue, I should be
    greatly obliged to you.</p>

    <p>Rappard told me he was going to buy all Cassagne's books. He
    has trouble with his perspective, and I know of no better
    remedy for this ailment; at least, if I am quite cured of it, I
    shall have those books to thank for it - that is to say, I put
    into practice the theory they contain. However, practice is a
    thing one cannot buy along with books; if that were so, there
    would be a larger sale of them, I suppose.</p>

    <p>And now adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
