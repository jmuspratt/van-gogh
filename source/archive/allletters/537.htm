    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Probably I shall hear from you tomorrow morning, but I have
    time to write tonight, and the week has been rather
    eventful.</p>

    <p>I expect to go to live in the house tomorrow, but as I have
    bought some more things and have still more to add to them, and
    I am only speaking of what is strictly necessary - you must
    again send me 100 francs instead of 50.</p>

    <p>If I reckon 50 francs for myself for the past week and
    deduct them from the 300 francs you sent, all that is left,
    even with another extra 50 francs, is no more than the exact
    price of the two beds. So you will see that in spite of that I
    have already bought many other things beside the beds and the
    bedding, I have already spent the greater part of the 50 francs
    for the week, and I have partly economized on both beds by
    having one of them somewhat plainer.</p>

    <p>I am convinced that in the end we shall do well by
    furnishing the studio. And I already feel freer in my work, and
    less harried by unnecessary annoyances than I have been.</p>

    <p>Only if, as I hope, I take more pains with the style and
    quality of my work, it will go a little more slowly, or rather
    I shall have to keep the pictures with me longer. That is, if
    they are subjects that are connected and complement each other.
    And also because there will be some pictures which I certainly
    do not want to send you till they are bone dry.</p>

    <p>In this last category there is a square size 30 canvas, a
    <art id=0468>corner of a garden with a weeping tree, grass, round clipped
    cedar shrubs and an oleander bush</art>. The same
    corner of the garden, that is, which you have already had <art id=0428>a
    study of in the last parcel</art>. But this one is
    bigger, there is a citron sky over everything, and also the
    colours have the richness and intensity of autumn. And besides
    it is in even heavier paint than the other one, plain and
    thick. That is picture number one this week.</p>

    <p>The second represents <art id=0467>the outside of a caf&eacute;, with the
    terrace lit up by a big gas lamp in the blue night, and a
    corner of a starry blue sky</art>.</p>

    <p>The third picture this week is <art id=0476>a portrait of myself,
    <i>almost colourless</i>, in ashen tones against a background
    of pale veronese green</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I purposely bought a mirror good enough to enable me to work
    from my image in default of a model, because if I can manage to
    paint the colouring of my own head, which is not to be done
    without some difficulty, I shall likewise be able to paint the
    heads of other good souls, men and women.</p>

    <p>The problem of painting night scenes and effects on the spot
    and actually by night interests me enormously. This week I have
    done absolutely nothing but paint and sleep and have my meals.
    That means sittings of twelve hours at a stretch.</label></p>

    <p>I read in the literary supplement of Saturday's Figaro (15
    September) the description of an impressionist house. This
    house was built with bricks - as it were like the bottoms of
    bottles - of convex glass, violet glass. With the sunshine
    reflected in it, and the yellow refractions, the effect was
    incredible. To support these walls of glass bricks, shaped like
    violet-coloured eggs, they had invented a support of black and
    gilt iron representing the weird branches of Virginia creeper
    and other climbing plants. This violet house was right in the
    middle of a garden where all the paths were of bright yellow
    sand. The ornamental flower borders were of course most unusual
    in colouring. The house is, if I remember correctly, in
    Auteuil.</p>

    <p>Without changing anything in this house either now or
    afterward, I want all the same to make it an artist's house
    through the decorations. That will come. A good handshake. I
    went for a splendid walk by myself today among the
    vineyards.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
