  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have been to Amsterdam this week. I hardly had time to see
    anything but the museum. I was there three days, I went on
    Tuesday and came back on Thursday. The result is that I am
    <i>very</i> glad I went in spite of the cost, and I made up my
    mind not to go so long without seeing pictures again.</p>

    <p>On account of the expenses I had put this trip off and off,
    like so many other things. But it is far better that I can no
    longer think this the right way. It is too important for my
    work, and when I look at the old masters, whose technique I
    understand much better now than before, then for the rest I
    need perhaps very little conversation.</p>

    <p>I do not know whether you remember the one to the left of
    the &ldquo;Night Watch,&rdquo; as pendant of &ldquo;The
    Syndics,&rdquo; there is a picture (unknown to me till now) by
    <art id=leanco>Frans Hals and P. Codde,</art> about twenty officers full length.
    <sup>1</sup> Did you ever notice that??? that alone - that one
    picture - is worth the trip to Amsterdam - especially for a
    colourist. There is a figure in it, the figure of a
    flag-bearer, in the extreme left corner, right against the
    frame - that figure is in grey, from top to toe, I shall call
    it pearl-grey - of a peculiar neutral tone, probably the result
    of orange and blue mixed in such a way that they neutralize
    each other - by varying that keynote, making it somewhat
    lighter here, somewhat darker there, the whole figure is as if
    it were painted with one same grey. But the leather boots are
    of a different material than the leggings, which differ from
    the folds of the trousers, which differ from the waistcoat -
    expressing a different material, differing in relation to
    colour - but all one family of grey. But just wait a
    moment!</p>

    <p>Now into that grey he brings blue and orange - and some
    white; the waistcoat has satin bows of a divine soft blue, sash
    and flag orange - a white collar.</p>

    <p>Orange, &ldquo;blanc,&rdquo; bleu, as the national colours
    were then - orange and blue, side by side, that most splendid
    colour scale, against a background of a grey, cleverly mixed by
    uniting just those two, let me call them poles of electricity
    (speaking of colours though) so that they annihilate each other
    against that grey and white. Further, we find in that picture -
    other orange scales against other blue, further, the most
    beautiful blacks against the most beautiful whites; the heads -
    about twenty of them, sparkling with life and spirit, and a
    technique! a colour! the figures of all those people superb and
    full size.</p>

    <p>But that orange blanc bleu fellow in the left
    corner&hellip;I seldom saw a more divinely beautiful figure. It
    is unique.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Delacroix would have raved about it - absolutely raved. I
    was literally rooted to the spot. Well you know &ldquo;The
    Singer,&rdquo; that laughing fellow - a bust in a
    greenish-black with carmine, carmine in the flesh colour
    too.</label></p>

    <p>You know the bust of the man in yellow, citron amorti, whose
    face, by the opposition of tones, has become a dashing masterly
    bronze, purplish (violet?).</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">B&uuml;rger has written about <art id=jbride>Rembrandt's &ldquo;Jewish
    Bride,&rdquo;</art> just as he wrote about van der Meer of Delft,
    <sup>2</sup> as he wrote about &ldquo;The Sower&rdquo; by
    Millet, as he wrote about Frans Hals, with devotion, and
    surpassing himself. &ldquo;The Syndics&rdquo; is perfect, is
    the most beautiful Rembrandt; but &ldquo;The Jewish
    Bride&rdquo; - not ranked so high, what an intimate, what an
    infinitely sympathetic picture it is, painted d'une main de
    feu. You see, in &ldquo;The Syndics&rdquo; Rembrandt is true to
    nature, though <i>even there</i>, and always, he soars aloft,
    to the very highest height, the infinite; but Rembrandt could
    do more than that - if he did not have to be <i>literally</i>
    true, as in a portrait, when he was free to <i>idealize</i>, to
    be a poet, that means Creator. That's what he is in &ldquo;The
    Jewish Bride.&rdquo; How Delacroix would have understood that
    picture. What a noble sentiment, infinitely deep.</label></p>

    <p>&ldquo;Il faut &ecirc;tre mort plusiers fois pour peindre
    ainsi&rdquo; [One must have died several times to paint like
    that], how true it is here. As to the pictures by Frans Hals -
    he always remains on <i>earth</i> - one can speak about them.
    Rembrandt is so deeply mysterious that he says things for which
    there are no words in any language. Rembrandt is truly called a
    <i>magician</i>&hellip;that's not an easy calling.</p>

    <p>I have packed several still lifes, which you will receive
    next week, together with <art id=0113>two souvenirs</art> from <art id=0211>Amsterdam</art>,
    which I caught on the wing, and also a
    few drawings. In a few days I shall also send you a book by de
    Goncourt, Ch&eacute;rie. De Goncourt is always beautiful, and
    his way of working is so honest and he drudged on it so
    hard.</p>

    <p>In Amsterdam I saw two pictures by Isra&euml;ls, &ldquo;The
    Fishermen of Zandvoort,&rdquo; and - one of his very latest -
    an old woman huddled together like a bundle of rags near the
    bedstead in which the corpse of her husband lies.</p>

    <p>Both pictures are masterpieces, I think. Let them jabber
    about technique as much as they like, in Pharisaical, hollow,
    hypocritical terms - the true painters are guided by that
    conscience which is called sentiment, their soul: their brains
    aren't subject to the pencil, but the pencil to their brains.
    Besides, the canvas is afraid of the real painter, and not the
    painter afraid of the canvas.</p>

    <p>In Amsterdam I also saw pictures of today, Witkamp and
    others. Witkamp is one of the best, reminds one of Jules
    Breton; others whom I have in mind but I shall not name, who
    always talk about what <i>they</i> call technique, I found
    <i>weak in that very technique</i>.</p>

    <p>You know all those cold grey tones which they think
    distinguished, but which are flat and uninteresting, childishly
    mixed. Nowadays they bring on the market ordinary colours
    purposely mixed with pure white, for the convenience of
    painters who paint in what they call a distinguished light
    colour scale.</p>

    <p>Just listen, <i>the technique</i>, the colouring, the
    modelling of &ldquo;The Fishermen of Zandvoort,&rdquo; for
    instance, is in my opinion Delacroix-like and superb; today's
    cold flat greys are technically not worth much, but remain
    <i>paint</i>, and with Isra&euml;ls one forgets the paint. But
    remember, I do not mean Jaap Maris, Willem Maris, Mauve,
    Neuhuys, who work in the right manner, each in his own colour
    scale, Blommers too. But those painters' school, their
    followers, Theo, I don't think are worth much.</p>

    <p>I have also seen the Fodor museum. &ldquo;The
    Shepherd&rdquo; by Decamps is really a masterpiece; do you
    remember the Meissonier, a sketch of a deathbed? The Diaz?</p>

    <p>Well, Bosboom, Waldorp, Nuyen, Rochussen, the
    <i>original</i> painters of that period of forty years back - I
    always like to see them.</p>

    <p>Rochussen possesses an &eacute;lan like Gavarni's.</p>

    <p>The still lifes I am sending are colour studies, I intend to
    make more of them; don't think this is useless. After a while
    they will get darker, but in a year, for instance, they will be
    better than now, when, being dry to the core, they will have
    got a solid varnish. If you use some drawing pins and put a
    great number of my studies, the old as well as the new ones,
    pell-mell on a wall of your room, then I think you will see
    that there is a connection between those studies, that the
    various colours harmonize.</p>

    <p>Speaking of black - the more I see of those pictures in a
    cold, childish colour scheme, the more I am glad that my
    studies are found too black.</p>

    <p>Look at &ldquo;The Fishermen of Zandvoort&rdquo; and see
    what colours it is painted with - it is painted with red, with
    blue, with yellow, with black and some dirty white, with brown
    (everything well mixed and broken), or isn't it? When
    Isra&euml;ls says that one must not paint black, he certainly
    never means what they now make of it, he means that there must
    be colour in the shadows, but that excludes neither a single
    colour scheme, however dark it may be, nor of course that of
    the blacks and browns and deep blues.</p>

    <p>But what's the good of thinking about it; it is much better
    to think of Rembrandt, of Frans Hals, of Isra&euml;ls, than to
    think of that fashionable impotency.</p>

    <p>I am writing you rather a long letter - though perhaps you
    may not believe what I say about the colours, and though you
    may find me pessimistic when I say that much of what is called
    delicate grey is a very ugly grey; though you may find me
    pessimistic or worse when I also disapprove of the smooth
    polishing of faces, hands and eyes, because the great masters
    all worked in quite a different way, perhaps by and by your own
    study of art, which I am glad you took up again thoroughly,
    will change you too.</p>

    <p>Now I have another favour to ask; that acquaintance of mine
    in Eindhoven, who went with me to Amsterdam, bought at Uncle
    Cor's: B&uuml;rger's Mus&eacute;es de la Hollande, Van der Hoop
    Rotterdam, but they did not have the first volume,
    Mus&eacute;es de la Haye et d'Amsterdam. However, we must have
    it; it is out of print, but you will be able to pick one up
    somewhere, and he will even pay 10 fr. for it, though
    preferably less of course. I shall send you the money
    immediately, as it is to be his and on that condition he has
    given me the order. So will you try to get it, please?</p>

    <p>If you find one, first read it through once more yourself,
    it is so beautiful.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">I did not enter Uncle Cor's shop with him.</label></p>

    <p>The small panels I painted in Amsterdam were done in a great
    hurry. One even in the waiting room of the station, when I was
    too early for the train, the other in the morning, before I
    went to the museum at 10 o'clock. Yet I am sending them to you,
    look upon them as &ldquo;Dutch tiles,&rdquo; on which something
    is dashed off in a few strokes.</p>

    <p>As to the end of the month, boy, I am literally cleaned out,
    what's to be done? Can't you send 20 fr. more, or however
    little it may be? Next month I also have to pay for colours,
    the first of November, 25 guilders rent.</p>

    <p>As to connections for my work, I spoke with somebody about
    it, and whenever I go again, I shall take some work with me.
    There is a general slackness which makes it easy enough to find
    an occasion for exhibition. Let us paint much, this is
    necessary if we want to have success; just because times are
    slack we must work hard; then, instead of finding all harbours
    closed to us, we will one day sweep the seas with a broomstick
    in the mast.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
