  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>My hearty congratulations for Father's birthday, and thanks
    for your letter, which I was very glad to receive just now. I
    congratulate you especially on the operation being
    over.<sup>1</sup> Such things as you describe make one shudder!
    May the worst be over now, at least the crisis is past! Poor
    woman! <label content="attitude.women">If women do not always show in their thoughts the energy
    and elasticity of men, who are disposed towards reflection and
    analysis, we cannot blame them, at least in my opinion, because
    in general they have to spend so much more strength than we in
    suffering pain. They suffer more and are more sensitive.</label></p>

    <p>And though they do not always understand our thoughts, they
    are sometimes truly capable of understanding when one is good
    to them. Not always, though, but &ldquo;the spirit is
    willing<i>,</i>&rdquo; and there is in women sometimes a
    curious kind of goodness.</p>

    <p>There must be a great load off your mind now that the
    operation is over.</p>

    <p>What a mystery life is, and love is a mystery within a
    mystery. It certainly never remains the same in a literal
    sense, but the changes are like the ebb and flow of the tide
    and leave the sea unchanged.</p>

    <p><label content="health.eyes">Since I wrote to you last, I have given my eyes some rest
    and it has done me good, though they still ache now and
    then.</label></p>

    <p>Do you know what has come into my mind, that in the first
    period of a painter's life one unconsciously makes it very hard
    for oneself - a feeling of not being able to master the work -
    by an uncertainty as to whether one will ever master it - by a
    great ambition to make progress, by a lack of self-confidence -
    one cannot banish a certain feeling of agitation, and one
    hurries oneself though one doesn't like to be hurried.</p>

    <p>This cannot be helped, and it is a time which one must go
    through, and which in my opinion cannot and should not be
    otherwise.</p>

    <p>In the studies, too, one is conscious of a nervousness and a
    certain dryness which is the exact opposite of the calm, broad
    touch one strives for, and yet it doesn't work well if one
    applies oneself too much to acquiring that broadness of
    touch.</p>

    <p>This gives one a feeling of nervous unrest and agitation,
    and one feels an oppression as on summer days before a
    thunderstorm. I had that feeling again just now, and when I
    have it, I change my work, just to make a new start.</p>

    <p>That trouble one has at the beginning sometimes gives an
    awkwardness to the studies.</p>

    <p>But I do not take this as a discouragement, because I have
    noticed it in myself as well as in others, who afterwards just
    slowly got rid of it.</p>

    <p>And I believe that <i>sometimes</i> one keeps that
    <i>painful</i> way of working one's whole life, but not always
    with so little result as in the beginning. What you write about
    Lhermitte is quite in keeping with the review of the exhibition
    of Black and White. They, too, speak about the bold touch which
    can almost be compared only to Rembrandt's. I should like to
    know such an artist's conception of Judas; you write of his
    having drawn Judas before the scribes, and I think that Victor
    Hugo could describe that in detail, <i>so that one would see
    it</i>, but to paint those expressions would be more difficult
    still.</p>

    <p>I found a page by Daumier: &ldquo;ceux qui ont vu un
    drame&rdquo; [those who have seen a Drama] and &ldquo;ceux qui
    ont vu une vaudeville.&rdquo; [those who have seen a vaudeville
    show] I have developed a growing longing to see more of
    Daumier's work. There is pith and a sober depth in him, he is
    witty and yet full of sentimental passion; sometimes, for
    instance in &ldquo;The Drunkards,&rdquo; and possibly also in
    &ldquo;The Barricade,&rdquo; which I do not know, I find a
    passion which can be compared to the white heat of iron.</p>

    <p>The same thing occurs in certain heads by Frans Hals, for
    instance, it is so sober that it seems cold; but when you look
    at it for a short while you are astonished to see how someone
    working apparently with so much emotion and so completely
    wrapped up in nature had at the same time the presence of mind
    to put it down with such a firm hand. I found the same thing in
    studies and drawings by de Groux; perhaps Lhermitte operates
    also at that white heat. And Menzel too.</p>

    <p>There are sometimes passages in Balzac or Zola, for
    instance in P&egrave;re Goriot<i>,</i> where words reach a
    degree of passion that is white-hot.</p>

    <p>I sometimes think I will make an experiment, and try to work
    in quite a different way, that is, to dare more and to risk
    more, but I am not sure that I should not first do more by way
    of studying the figure directly from the model.</p>

    <p>I am also looking for a way to shut off the light in the
    studio, or to let it in as I please. It doesn't fall enough
    from above, I think, and there is too much of it. For the time
    being I shut it off with cardboard now and then, but I must try
    and get the landlord to produce some shutters.</p>

    <p>What was in the letter I told you I had torn up was quite in
    keeping with what you say.</p>

    <p>But while finding more and more that one is not perfect
    oneself, and makes mistakes, and that other people do likewise,
    so that difficulties continually arise which are the opposite
    of illusions, I think that those who do not lose courage and
    who do not become indifferent, ripen through it, and one must
    bear hardships in order to ripen.</p>

    <p>Sometimes I cannot believe that I am only thirty years old,
    I feel so much older.</p>

    <p>I feel older <i>only</i> when I think that most people who
    know me consider me a failure, and how it really might be so,
    if some things do not change for the better; and when I think
    it <i>might be so</i>, I feel it so vividly that it
    quite depresses me and makes me as downhearted as if it were
    really so. In a calmer and more normal mood I am sometimes glad
    that thirty years have passed, and not without teaching me
    something for the future, and I feel strength and energy for
    the next thirty years, if I should live that long.</p>

    <p>And in my imagination I see years of serious work before me,
    and happier ones than the first thirty.</p>

    <p>How it will be in reality doesn't depend <i>only</i> on
    myself, the world and circumstances must also contribute to
    it.</p>

    <p>What concerns me and is a source of responsibility is that I
    should make the most of the circumstances and try my best to
    make progress.</p>

    <p>The age of thirty is, for the working man, just the
    beginning of a period of some stability, and as such one feels
    young and full of energy.</p>

    <p>But, at the same time, a phase of life is past. This makes
    one melancholy, thinking some things will never come back. And
    it is no silly sentimentalism to feel a certain regret. Well,
    many things really begin at the age of thirty, and certainly
    all is not over then. But one doesn't expect out of life what
    one has already learned that it cannot give, but rather one
    begins to see more and more clearly that life is only a kind of
    sowing time, and the harvest is not here.</p>

    <p>Perhaps that's the reason that one sometimes feels
    indifferent toward the opinion of the world, and if that
    opinion depresses us all too strongly, one may throw it
    off.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I had better tear up this letter as well.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">I understand perfectly that you are quite absorbed by the
    condition of the woman; that is one of the things which are
    necessary for her rescue, and also for her recovery.</label></p>

    <p>For one must throw oneself headlong into it, and the English
    saying is true: &ldquo;If you want it well done, you must do it
    yourself, you mustn't leave it to others.&rdquo; That means
    that one must keep in hand the care in general and the
    management of the whole.</p>

    <p>We had a few real spring days, for instance last Monday,
    which I enjoyed very much.</p>

    <p>The cycle of the seasons is a thing which is strongly felt
    by the people. For instance, in a neighbourhood like the Geest
    and in those courts of almshouses or &ldquo;homes of
    charity,&rdquo; the winter is always a difficult, anxious and
    oppressive time, and spring is a deliverance. If one pays
    attention, one sees that such a first spring day is a kind of
    Gospel message.</p>

    <p>And it is pathetic to see so many grey, withered faces come
    out of doors on such a day, not to do something special, but as
    if to convince themselves that spring is there. So, for
    instance, all kinds of people, of whom one would not expect it,
    throng the market around the spot where a man sells crocuses,
    snowdrops, bluebells and other bulbs. Sometimes a dried-up
    government clerk, apparently a kind of Jusserand in a
    threadbare black coat with greasy collar - that <i>he</i>
    should be beside the snowdrops is a pretty picture! I think the
    poor people and the painters have in common that feeling for
    the weather and the cycle of the seasons. Of course everybody
    feels it, but for the well-to-do middle-class it is not so
    important, and it doesn't affect much their frame of mind in
    general. I thought it a characteristic saying for a navvy:
    &ldquo;In winter I suffer as much from the cold as the winter
    corn does.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Now for your patient too spring will be welcome, may it do
    her good! How terrible that operation was, at least I was
    frightened by the description.</p>

    <p>Rappard is recovering, did I tell you he had brain fever? It
    will be some time before he can go to work again, but he is
    starting to take a walk now and then.</p>

    <p><label content="health.eyes">If my eyes do not improve, I'll follow your advice and bathe
    them with tea. As it is they are getting better, so for the
    present I'll leave them alone. For they never troubled me
    before, except once this winter when I had toothache, so I
    believe it is nothing but strain and overwork.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, lately my eyes can stand the fatigue of
    drawing better than previously.</label></p>

    <p>Write soon again if you can, and believe me, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I do not know whether you know those little almshouses on
    the Brouwersgracht opposite the hospital. I should like to draw
    there when the weather permits. This week I made a few
    scratches there already. They are a few rows of small houses
    with little gardens which I think belong to the charity
    board.</p>
