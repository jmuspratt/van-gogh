    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I haven't written you for quite a long time; first of all I
    waited for an answer to my last letter, but when it was not
    forthcoming I supposed this was because you had gone to
    Drenthe. Then I got a lot of work to do, as a result of which
    couldn't find the time to write these last weeks. But now
    please try to find a little time to let me know what you have
    been doing, and especially to tell me how your large picture of
    the &ldquo;Fish Market&rdquo; is progressing.</p>

    <p>Now I'll go on writing about myself. This summer I saw a
    house at Eindhoven which belongs to a retired goldsmith, who is
    rich now, and who has several times got together a collection
    of antiques which he resold. Now this man paints a little, and
    in his house (crowded again with beautiful and ugly antiques)
    he has a room whose walls he wants to paint himself. He has a
    plan for it. When I went to see him there were six panels, each
    one and a half meters long and sixty centimeters high [approx.
    5' by 2'], which he wants to fill with something, and on which
    he intended to paint a Last Supper, among other things,
    according to a cartoon which was done, so to speak, in a modern
    Gothic style. <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Then I told him that - as it was a dining room - the
    appetites of those sitting at the table there would be
    considerably more stimulated, in my opinion, if they saw scenes
    from the rural life of the district on the walls instead of
    mystical Last Suppers. The good man did not deny this. And,
    after he had visited my studio, I made six preliminary sketches
    for him of subjects from country life - &ldquo;Sower,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Plougher,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wheat Harvest,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Potato Planting,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shepherd,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Winter Scene with Ox Wagon.&rdquo; And now I am working
    on them.<label content="business.sales"> But on condition that I paint the six canvases <i>for
    myself</i> but that I bear his dining room in mind, for
    instance with regard to their size; he will pay the expenses of
    models and paint, whereas the canvases remain my property, and
    will be returned to me after he has copied them. </label>This enables
    me to do things that would get too expensive if I had to pay
    for everything. And it's a job I enjoy doing and which I'm
    working hard at. But on the other hand I must exert myself
    quite a bit to explain things to him while he is doing the
    copying. I have already finished painted sketches in the
    ultimate size of about five by two feet of the
    &ldquo;Plougher&rdquo; [F 1142, JH 512] and the
    &ldquo;Sower&rdquo; [F 1143, JH 509] and the
    &ldquo;Shepherd.&rdquo; [F 0042, JH 517]. I have smaller ones
    of the &ldquo;Wheat Harvest&rdquo; [JH 508] and the &ldquo;Ox
    Wagon in Winter.&rdquo; [F 1144, JH 511]. So I suppose you can
    imagine that I am not exactly sitting idle these days.</p>

    <p>Have I told you that I have done another &ldquo;Woman
    Spinning&rdquo; and also another &ldquo;Weaver&rdquo;?</p>

    <p>I have received an excellent book on J. F. Millet by
    Sensier, and I have bought myself a book by Blanc, Grammaire
    des Arts du Dessin, on the strength of a passage quoted from it
    in Artistes de mon Temps. This book treats of pretty much the
    same problems as the little book by Vosmaer, but I myself
    greatly prefer reading Blanc. You can read the book by Blanc,
    and the one about Millet too, if you like.</p>

    <p>Regards - from my parents too - and believe me.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
