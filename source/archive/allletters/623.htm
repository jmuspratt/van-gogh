  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your last letter; I hope Wil has recovered
    from her indisposition and that it was no worse than you said.
    Many thanks also for the package of canvas and paints which has
    just arrived.</p>

    <p>I have enough subjects for pictures in my head for when the
    weather will let me work outside.</p>

    <p>I am pleased with what you say of <art id=0647>the copy after Millet,
    &ldquo;La Veill&eacute;e.&rdquo;</art> The
    more I think about it, the more I think that there is
    justification for trying to reproduce some of Millet's things
    which he himself had no time to paint in oil. Working thus on
    his drawings or on his woodcuts is not purely and simply
    copying. Rather it is translating - into another language -
    that of colour - the impressions of light and shade in black
    and white. So I have just finished <art id=0649>the three </art>other<art id=0684> &ldquo;Hours</art>
    of <art id=0686>the Day,&rdquo;</art> after the woodcuts by Lavielle.
    It has taken me a lot of time and trouble. For you know that I already did the
    &ldquo;Travaux des Champs&rdquo; last summer. Now I haven't
    sent these reproductions - you'll see them someday - because
    they were more groping attempts than these, but all the same
    they have been very useful to me for the &ldquo;Hours of the
    Day.&rdquo; Later on, who knows, perhaps I shall be able to
    make lithographs of them.</p>

    <p>I am curious to know what M. Lauzet will say of them.</p>

    <p>They will take quite a month more to dry, the three last
    ones, but once you get them, you will see clearly that they
    have been done out of a profound and sincere admiration for
    Millet. Then, whether they are someday criticized or despised
    as copies, it will nonetheless be true that they have their
    justification in the attempt to make Millet's work more
    accessible to the great general public.</p>

    <p>Now, I am going to speak to you again about what I think we
    could do for the future, to cut expenses. At Montevergues there
    is an asylum where one of the employees was an attendant. He
    tells me that one pays only 22 sous per day there, and that the
    patients are even clothed by the establishment. Further they
    make them work on the land that belongs to the property; and
    there is also a forge, a carpenters shop, etc. Once they get to
    know me a little, I do not believe that they would forbid me to
    paint; then there is always the point that it is less expensive
    for one thing, and for another, that one can work on something.
    Therefore one is not miserable there with something to do,
    which is good. But aside from the idea of Montevergues, if I
    return to Holland, are there not establishments there also
    where one works and where it is not expensive and where one has
    the right to take advantage of? While I do not know if
    Montevergues accepts foreigners, there would probably be a bit
    higher rate and especially admission difficulties, that it
    would be better to forget it.</p>

    <p>I have to tell you that that reassures me somewhat to think
    things can be simplified. Because now it turns out to be too
    expensive, and the idea of going to Paris and then to the
    country, without having any other resource to offset the cost
    except painting, would be making the pictures expensive
    enough.</p>

    <p>You should discuss it with C. M. someday, if you see him,
    and tell him frankly that I shall try my best, and that I have
    no preference at all.</p>

    <p>I have seen Mr. Peyron again this morning, he tells that he
    leaves me at complete liberty to amuse myself, and that it is
    necessary for me to guard against depression as much as I can.
    Well, it is good advice to think about, and it is also an
    obligation. Now, you understand that in an establishment where
    invalids work the land, I would find many subjects for studies
    and drawings, and that I would not be in the least bit
    miserable there. Well, it is necessary to think of these things
    while one has the time.</p>

    <p>I believe that if I came to Paris, I would not at first do
    anything but draw Greek casts again, because it is always
    necessary for me to study.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">For the moment, I feel very well and I hope that that will
    remain so.</p>

    <p>And I have the same hope that it will get even better, if I
    return to the North.</label></p>

    <p>Don't forget that a broken pitcher is a broken pitcher and
    therefore in no way do I have any pretensions. I think that at
    home in Holland they always value painting more or less, so
    that an institution would hardly object to letting me do it.
    However, over and above painting, it would be important to have
    the opportunity for an occupation, and it would cost less.
    Hasn't the country, and working in it, always been to our
    taste? And are we not a bit indifferent, you as much as I, to
    life in a big city?</p>

    <p>I must tell you that at times I feel too well to be idle,
    and I fear that I would not make anything good coming to Paris.
    I am able, and I very much want to earn some money with my
    painting, and it would be necessary to make enough that my
    expenses do not exceed their value, and even that the money
    spent could be returned little by little.</p>

    <p>To talk of something else, I cannot manage to see the South
    like the good Italians - Fortuny, Jimenez, Tapir&oacute;
    and others - on the contrary, I see it more and more with a
    Northerner's eye! It is not, believe me, that I should not like
    to be able to live as before, without this preoccupation with
    my health. Anyway, we will make the attempt <i>once</i>, but
    probably not <i>twice</i> in the spring, if this passes away
    completely.</p>

    <p>Today I got the 10 francs which were still with M. Peyron.
    When I go to Arles, I shall have to pay three month's rent for
    the room where my furniture is, that will be in February. This
    furniture, I think, will be useful, if not to me, then to some
    other painter who wants to establish himself in the country. In
    case I leave, wouldn't it be wiser to send it to Gauguin, who
    will probably spend more time in Brittany, than to you, who
    will not have any place to put it? That's another thing we must
    think of in time.</p>

    <p>I think that by giving three heavy old chests to someone, I
    could get out of paying the rest of the rent and perhaps the
    packing cost. I paid about 30 francs for them. I will write a
    note to Gauguin and De Haan to ask if they intend to stay in
    Brittany, and if they would like me to send the furniture, and
    then if they would wish me to go there too. I will pledge
    myself to nothing, only I shall say that most probably I am not
    staying on here. This week I am going to start on <art id=0632>the
    snow-covered field</art> and <art id=0668>Millet's &ldquo;The
    First Steps,&rdquo;</art> in the same size as the
    others. Then there will be six canvases in a series, and I can
    tell you, I have put much thought into the disposition of the
    colours while working on these last three of the &ldquo;Hours
    of the Day.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>You see nowadays there are so many, many people who do not
    feel they are made for publicity, but who support and reinforce
    what others do. People who translate books, for example. Or
    engravers, lithographers. Take Vernier, for instance, and
    Lerat.</p>

    <p>So that means that I do not hesitate to make copies. I
    should so much like, if I had time to travel, to copy Giotto's
    work, that painter who would be as modern as Delacroix, if he
    were not primitive, yet so different from the other primitives.
    However, I have not seen much of his work, but there is one
    piece which is comforting.</p>

    <p>So what I think I shall do in painting is <art id=0667>the &ldquo;Men
    Drinking&rdquo; by Daumier</art> and the<art id=0669> &ldquo;Convict Prison&rdquo; by
    R&eacute;gamey</art>. You will find them among the wood engravings.</p>

    <p>For the moment I am busy with the Millets, but this means
    that I shall not lack things to work on.</p>

    <p>So even half locked up, I shall be able to occupy myself for
    a good while.</p>

    <p>What the impressionists have found in colour will develop
    even more, but many forget the tie which binds them to the
    past, and I will strive to show that I have little belief in a
    rigorous division between impressionists and others. I think it
    is very fine that in this century there have been painters like
    Millet, Delacroix and Meissonier, who <i>cannot be
    surpassed</i>. For though we do not like Meissonier as much as
    some people, there's no getting away from it when you see his
    &ldquo;Readers,&rdquo; his &ldquo;Halting Place,&rdquo; and so
    many other pictures, it is something. And then we leave out
    what is absolutely his strongest point, that is to say the
    military painting, because we like it less than the
    country.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, to be just, one must really say that what he
    has done cannot be surpassed or changed. Once more I hope our
    sister is better. Kind regards to all,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent.</p>

    <p>[The beginning of the postscript is missing]</p>

    <p>&hellip;. exaggerated in the work. That parents who are
    ignorant of painting should cease loving a child who is a bit
    different from the others - but even if they understood
    painting, how could one reproach them with it in this society
    of money and soldiers? So, it would not be unfortunate for him
    if he should do his military service, it would only mean
    acknowledging in time that he is defeated by fate. What has
    become of Vignon? After all, this much is certain, what is
    important is not playing the part of a proud man or having
    great hopes for the future. Let's take the terrible realities
    for what they are, and if it should be necessary for me to give
    up painting, I think I should do so. At any rate, being in
    better health than I have been for two years, I will again do
    my best to find some job or other. I have often told myself
    that if I had had a calmer temperament two years ago, like
    Seurat's for instance, I should have been able to resist.</p>
