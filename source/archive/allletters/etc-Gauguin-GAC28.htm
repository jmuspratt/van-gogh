    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I wanted to write to your brother but I know than you see him
    every day and I am afraid of boring him, occupied as he is from
    morning to night by business. </p>

    <p>I left to work in Brittany, (still a rage to paint), and I had
    good hopes to have funds for that. </p>

    <p>The little that I sold served to pay for the few pressing debts
    and in one month I am going to be without anything. Zero is a negative strength. </p>

    <p>I don't want to press your brother, but a little word from you on this topic
    would calm me, or at least would make me be patient. My god, these questions of
    money are terrifying for an artist!</p>

    <p>And if it is necessary to give some <i>discounts</i> don't worry, as long as I find
    some funds. I have just spent 15 days in bed with a fever and I am starting to
    work again. If I can last 5 to 6 months I believe that I will do some good canvases. </p>

    <p>An encouraging word in answer if it is possible.</p>

    <p>Ever Yours, </p>

    <p>Paul Gauguin. </p>

    <p>Pont-Aven at Mme. Gloanec </p>

    <p>Finisterre </p>
