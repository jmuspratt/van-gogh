  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter; I was interested to learn that you
    are working on your picture &ldquo;The Tile Painters&rdquo;
    <sup>1</sup> again. I also found something in your letter which
    bears on your coming here, which was all the more reason for me
    to decide to send you one of these days the rest of the wood
    engraving duplicates that I have, as I think you would
    <i>not</i> like to wait for them any longer than necessary. You
    will, as I see it, <i>after</i>looking them over, consider
    various of the sheets not unsatisfactory possessions. I have
    also taken apart the Graphic Portfolio and inserted the items
    among my loose sheets. This is the reason why you have already
    got Herkomer's &ldquo;Low Lodginghouse,&rdquo; and a number of
    the best ones in the present batch too. I am sending you the
    ordinary prints of some of the sheets whose duplicates I got in
    this way, but also some others which are impressions from the
    book itself, which means that they are not prints from cliches
    but impressions of the original blocks.</p>

    <p>In the present package you will at last find some things by
    Boyd Houghton, namely &ldquo;Shaker Evans,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Liverpool Harbour,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mail in the
    Wilderness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Niagara Falls.&rdquo; After you
    have seen my Boyd Houghtons from the first year of the Graphics
    you will understand more clearly what I wrote about the
    importance of this master's work. Van der Weele saw them too
    this week and was struck by them.</p>

    <p>This week I have been working on drawings of figures with
    wheelbarrows - perhaps for lithographs too - but how do I know
    what will come of it? - I just go on drawing, that's all. As I
    told you just now, Van der Weele came to see me during the
    week. I had just been working from the model, and we held an
    art show of pictures from the Graphic spread out on a
    wheelbarrow that had been the attribute of the model I had been
    drawing. We looked at one sheet by Boyd Houghton with special
    attention - I already wrote you about it once - it represents a
    corridor in the offices of the Graphic at Christmas. The
    artists' models come to wish them a Merry Christmas, and most
    probably to receive tips. Most of the models are invalids - a
    man on crutches leads the procession - his coattail is held by
    a blind man, who is carrying another man on his back who cannot
    walk at all - his coattail again is held by a second blind man,
    who is followed by a wounded man with a bandage around his
    head, and after him come others shuffling along. I said to Van
    der Weele, &ldquo;Just tell me - do you think we use <i>enough
    models</i>??&rdquo; Van der Weele answered, &ldquo;When
    Isra&euml;ls came to my studio the other day, and saw my large
    picture of the sand carts, he said, I advise you above all to
    use a lot of models.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, I believe that many would use more models if they had
    a bit more money - but if we only spent every tenpence we could
    spare on them all the same...!<sup>2</sup> It would be
    wonderful if the artists combined, and there was some place
    where the models could meet every day, as in the old days of
    the <i>Graphic.</i></p>

    <p>Well, however that may be, <i>let's encourage each other to
    do it,</i> and let's inspire each other as much as we can to
    work, on, not in the manner the dealers want us to, but with
    virile strength, truth, good faith and honesty. All of which
    has in my opinion a direct bearing on working from the model.
    It seems to be some kind of fate that what one produces in this
    fashion is called &ldquo;unpleasing&rdquo;; but I think that
    this imaginary but very active prejudice would have to yield to
    <i>contrary</i> efforts on the part of the painters, provided
    these painters agreed among themselves, and helped and backed
    each other up, and no longer let the dealers be the only ones
    to speak to the public, but spoke up themselves once in a while
    too; for although I am willing to admit that what a painter
    would say about his own work would not always be understood, I
    am still of the opinion that a better seed would be sown in the
    field of public opinion in this way than the seeds the dealers
    and such fellows customarily sow according to a never-changing
    formula - convention &hellip;</p>

    <p>These thoughts cannot but lead me to the question of
    exhibitions. You are working for exhibitions - all right - I
    for my part most decidedly don't hold with exhibitions. I used
    to attach more value to them than I do now - I don't know why -
    formerly I looked upon exhibitions otherwise than I do now -
    perhaps I once had rather too good an opportunity to look
    behind the scenes at some proceedings connected with
    exhibitions - and perhaps it is not merely indifference on my
    part when I say that many people are mistaken about the results
    of an exhibition. I don't want to expatiate on this theme at
    present, I only want to say this, Speaking for myself, I expect
    more good from a uniting of <i>painters</i> actuated by mutual
    sympathy and singleness of purpose and warm friendship and
    loyalty than from a uniting of their <i>works</i> by means of
    exhibitions.</p>

    <p>I do not venture to infer from the fact that I see a number
    of pictures hanging together in the same hall that there is a
    spirit of unity and mutual respect and wholesome co-operation
    among those who made said pictures, etc. I consider this latter
    exigency - whether it is to be or not to be - so important that
    very little else can be counted important except in connection
    with achieving spiritual unity, and however important some
    other things may be considered by themselves, no substitute
    can ever make up for the lack of this unity; and the lack of it
    means the lack of sure ground to stand on. I don't at all
    desire that exhibitions, etc., should be discontinued, but what
    I do desire is a reform, or rather a renewal and strengthening,
    of painters' societies and of the co-operation among painters,
    all of which would have such an influence that even exhibitions
    would actually become useful.</p>

    <p>As regards your &ldquo;Tile Painters&rdquo; - and I was
    interested to hear that you have started working on it again -
    I am extremely curious to know what it is and how it will turn
    out. I am interested in everything connected with this picture
    or your other pictures, and all that I see of them or hear of
    them arouses my sympathy - whether or not they are going to be
    sent to an exhibition leaves me as indifferent as the kind of
    frame you have put around them.</p>

    <p>Well, adieu. Write again soon.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
