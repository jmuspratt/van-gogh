    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I was at <i>Van der Weele's</i> last Sunday. I saw a picture
    of his there that was by far the most beautiful of his work
    that I know. It represented some sand carts near the edge of a
    canal or ditch - &ldquo;In the Mist.&rdquo; The subject, as
    well as the conception and execution, showed some affinity,
    perhaps, with Mauve's work. <sup>1</sup> It was done in the
    same vein, but had enough personality to be absolutely
    original, and distinctly his. The size was rather large. I am
    telling you this in order to state that in my opinion Van der
    Weele is one of the &ldquo;rising men.&rdquo; I wish you knew
    him personally; I think the wood engravings might easily lead
    to your getting acquainted. Either you could - sooner or later
    - take the sheets in question (the Herkomer, I mean, and what
    you may find besides) to him, or you could let him have them
    through me as intermediary, allowing me to mention that you are
    the donor, and to tell him that you have already seen some of
    his work and would like to get in touch with him - or something
    of the sort. I mean, in short, that if you could come into
    contact with him somehow, you would find him a man you'd like
    to keep in touch with, and you'd probably become <i>real
    friends</i><i>.</i></p>

    <p>I sent you a roll of wood engravings today; they are the
    double-page engravings from the Graphic<i>.</i> I have some
    more, but some of them are unsuitable for rolling because tears
    in them have been repaired and they are mounted, and there are
    also less important ones. But first of all these are sheets I
    am sure you don't have, and they are such besides that, if you
    <i>should</i> have them, I could give them to Van der Weele. So
    please check whether or not you have them, and if so return
    them.</p>

    <p>You can select the other ones later on; but seeing that, if
    you should come here, we should need all our time for other
    things too, I think it advisable to look over the most
    important wood engravings in this way. Then that part of the
    job at least is finished.</p>

    <p>As soon as I have time I shall sort out the smaller ones too
    provisionally and send you those which I think you don't have
    for closer verification. For the present I am including only
    two of the smaller Lan&ccedil;ons, which, as they are French,
    might slip my memory when I sort out the Graphics later on, and
    which you would undoubtedly like to have - unless you have them
    already. Isn't the &ldquo;Boarding School&rdquo; by Hol superb?
    And &ldquo;Ploughing&rdquo; and &ldquo;Claxton [Caxton]
    Printing&rdquo; by Small?</p>

    <p>You are no doubt having winter weather again in Utrecht.
    Herewith a little scratch from my window. I think it such an
    enormously pleasant thing to be sitting by the fire in the
    twilight, looking out the window at a landscape in the
    snow.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I have found the &ldquo;black mountain crayon&rdquo; I wrote
    you about here in this city too; it is something which was
    virtually unknown to me until recently. But now I discover that
    it is not so rare - and perhaps you know it, and have it
    already. If not, I think it a suitable material for finishing
    drawings up.</label></p>

    <p>Adieu, old fellow, a handshake in thought - write soon and
    believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
