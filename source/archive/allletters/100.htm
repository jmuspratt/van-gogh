  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You remember that night at Dordrecht when we walked together
    through the town, around the Great Church and through so many
    streets, and along the canals - in which the old houses and the
    lights from the windows were reflected? You spoke then about
    the description of a day in London by Th&eacute;ophile Gautier,
    the coachman for a wedding party in front of the door of a
    church on a stormy foggy day: I saw it all before me. If that
    struck you, you will also appreciate the pages I enclose.
    [Lamartine's Cromwell<i>.</i> Vincent copied three full pages,
    part of which is added to this letter.] I read them on a very
    stormy day last week: it was in the evening, and the sunset
    threw a ruddy glow on the gray evening clouds, against which
    the masts of the ships and the row of old houses and trees
    stood out; and everything was reflected in the water, and the
    sky threw a strange light on the black earth, on the green
    grass with daisies and buttercups, and on the hushes of white
    and purple lilacs, and on the elderberry bushes of the garden
    in the yard.</p>

    <p>In London I had read that book of Lamartine's, and I was
    very much struck by it; the last pages especially made a deep
    impression on me again. Tell me what you think of it.<label content="feelings.nostalgia"> These
    places mentioned in it - Hampton Court with its avenues of
    linden trees full of rookeries; Whitehall overgrown with ivy at
    the back; and the square bordering St. James's Park where one
    can see Westminster Abbey - they are all before me, and the
    weather and the gloomy atmosphere: cela m'emp&ecirc;che de
    dormir. [It keeps me from sleeping.]</label></p>

    <p>Were you in Etten Sunday? I certainly hope so, and that you
    had a pleasant day. I gathered this from a sentence in the last
    letter from Etten, &ldquo;We expect Theo probably next
    Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>This evening I have to go to Uncle Stricker's. Went to early
    service yesterday morning, heard a sermon on the text:
    &ldquo;Do you want to be healthy?&rdquo; - how they that be
    whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. After that
    I heard Uncle Stricker in the well-known Amstel Church on II
    Cor. 4: I 8: For the things which are seen are temporal; but
    the things which are not seen are eternal.</p>

    <p>Toward the end there was a passage in which he spoke with
    much rapture and exclaimed, &ldquo;But love remains&rdquo;; how
    we are tied together by God with bonds that are in His hand,
    and in them lies our strength, for they are old and do not
    easily break.</p>

    <p>I am very busy, so &agrave; Dieu; perhaps I will continue
    this letter tonight, a handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Today when I passed the flower market on the Singel, I saw
    something very pretty. A peasant was standing selling a whole
    bunch of pots with all kinds of flowers and plants; ivy was
    behind it, and his little girl was sitting between it all, such
    a child as Maris would have painted, so simple in her little
    black bonnet, and with a pair of bright, smiling eyes. She was
    knitting; the man praised his ware - and if I could have spared
    the money I should have liked only too well to buy some - and
    he said, pointing unintentionally at his little daughter also,
    &ldquo;Doesn't it look pretty?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>5 June</p>

    <p>Yesterday evening I was at Stricker's. M. M., who is engaged
    to Paul, was also there; she reminds me of Ellen in The Wide,
    Wide World. Her father was a very clever clergyman, an
    extraordinary man, an intimate friend of Uncle Stricker's. We
    walked along the Buitenkant and the embankment near the East
    railway. I cannot describe to you how beautiful it was there in
    the twilight. Rembrandt, Michel and others have sometimes
    painted it: the ground dark, the sky still lit by the glow of
    the setting sun, the row of houses and steeples against it,
    lights in the windows everywhere, and the whole mirrored in the
    water. And the people and the carriages like little black
    figures, such as one sees sometimes in a Rembrandt. We were so
    struck by the beauty of it that we began to talk about many
    things.</p>

    <p>I sat up writing late last night and was up again early this
    morning, it was such beautiful weather. At night there is also
    a beautiful view of the yard; everything is dead quiet then,
    and the lamps are burning and the starlit sky is over it
    all.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;When all sounds cease, God's voice is heard under the
    stars.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Write me soon and tell me if that part about Cromwell isn't
    taken from the very heart of London.</p>

    <p>Youth of Cromwell [Quoted in French]</p>

    <p>The family soon lost its wealth. He retired to a small
    estate he possessed amidst the marshes of Huntingdon. The
    barren, rough and morose character of this shore district, the
    monotonous horizon, the muddy river, the clouded skies, the
    meager trees, the infrequent cottages, the rude habits of the
    inhabitants, were such as to make the young man's nature
    concentrated and gloomy. The soul of a land seems to enter into
    that of man. Often a lively, ardent and profound faith seems to
    emanate from a poor and dismal country; like country, like man.
    The soul is a mirror before it becomes a home.</p>

    <p>One domestic grief overtook Cromwell, touching him deeply in
    this period of growing ascendancy in his life; one is
    astonished to see tears in the eyes of a man who had watched,
    dry-eyed, the unfortunate Charles I being torn from the arms of
    his children to die. He lost his ninety-four-year-old
    mother&hellip;</p>
