  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>As you see, I am writing you from The Hague.</p>

    <p>I have been here since Sunday. You know Mauve had planned to
    come and stay in Etten for a few days. I was afraid that
    something would prevent it or that the visit would be too
    short, and I thought, I will try it in another and I hope
    better way.</p>

    <p>I said to Mauve, Do you approve of my coming here for a
    month or so, and occasionally troubling you for some help and
    advice? After that I shall have overcome the first petites
    mis&egrave;res of painting, and then I shall go back to the
    Heike.</p>

    <p>Well, Mauve at once sat me down before <art id=001>a still life with a
    pair of old wooden shoes and some other objects</art>, so I could set
    to work. And I also go to him for drawing in
    the evening.</p>

    <p>I am staying in a little inn near Mauve, where I pay 30
    guilders a month for a room and breakfast. So if I may count on
    the 100 fr. from you, I can manage.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">And Mauve gives me hope that perhaps I shall soon make
    something saleable. I can assure you that this simple sentence
    of Mauve's pleased me more than a cartload of Jesuistical
    compliments would have.</label></p>

    <p>Perhaps Mauve will soon write you himself.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile&rdquo; I have been to Amsterdam. Uncle
    Stricker was rather angry, though he gave vent to it in more
    polite words than &ldquo;God damn you.&rdquo; But nevertheless
    I am not sorry I paid that visit. <label content="feelings.love">What must be done now? For
    you know that I came back no less in love than I went, but not
    because she had encouraged me; on the contrary, she made me for
    a moment - or rather, for twenty-four hours - profoundly
    miserable, but when I thought it over I seemed to see some
    light after all. When I thought it over, I say, and somewhat
    more seriously than romanticism or sentimentality would allow.
    But it looks less and less like gathering strawberries in
    spring; well, the strawberries will no doubt come in due
    time.</label></p>

    <p>I also went to see Mr. Tersteeg, and among the painters I
    met (the merry) Weissenbruch and Jules Bakhuizen, and De
    Bock.</p>

    <p>In short, Theo, I think I shall daily become more realistic
    in everything. Thank God she is something very real, too.</p>

    <p>Mauve and Jet send you their compliments, believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>P.S. As soon as Mauve allows it, I will send you another
    drawing; but he says that I must keep all my <i>studies</i>,
    especially those of the figure. But within a relatively short
    time, Mauve says, I shall learn to make little
    watercolours.</p>
