  <body>
    <p>Nuenen, 1<sup>st</sup> half July 1885</p>

    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>To my regret I have not yet discovered any reply from you.
    The more I think about it the more I feel that I shall
    personally not be at all sorry to be done with you - unless you
    withdraw once and for all a correspondence that - in my opinion
    - is hardly a credit to you. But I repeat that I am willing to
    look upon the whole business as a misunderstanding, and not to
    alter our friendly relations, provided that you realize
    yourself - that you were mistaken.</p>

    <p>As I don't want things to drag on on any account, I beg you
    to answer me before the end of the week. And I shall know,
    according to the contents of your letter, what to decide.</p>

    <p>In case you do not write this week - <i>I no longer
    desire your reply</i>. And then time will tell whether
    your remarks about my work and my person were justified or not
    - were made in good faith or not.</p>

    <p>With greetings,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
