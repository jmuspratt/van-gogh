  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I've a good deal to say about your calling my last letter
    &ldquo;particularly unpleasant.&rdquo; In the first place this
    - some time ago you wrote me quite a number of unpleasant
    things which I have been hearing from you and others for over
    fifteen years now - and that's a long time - about domestic
    relations here.</p>

    <p>And especially added to this &ldquo;that you are
    suspicious.&rdquo; If it had only been the former, it is
    probable that I should have paid no more attention to it.</p>

    <p>But your additional remark about your suspiciousness was a
    bit too much me, and I have repeatedly begged you to withdraw
    the word or to explain it, for I will not tolerate such a thing
    being said to me without my asking for an explanation.</p>

    <p>In my last letter I compared suspiciousness in general to
    looking through black glasses.</p>

    <p>And I said the ugliest misunderstandings were caused by
    it.</p>

    <p>And this is true.</p>

    <p>If you on your part <i>turn this inside out</i> now, and
    write me, &ldquo;You make me think of old people who are always
    saying that in their young days everything was better,
    meanwhile forgetting that they themselves have changed,&rdquo;
    this does not stagger me in the least.</p>

    <p>The thing we were discussing was suspiciousness, <i>which
    was not mentioned by me but by yourself</i>, i.e. on your part
    with regard to <i>me</i>; first apply what you say about old
    people to this, and after that see whether it may apply to me.
    If it <i>does</i> apply to me after that - then I shall have to
    reform.</p>

    <p>As to what I wrote about a certain atmosphere at home, which
    I have more opportunity to observe than I care for, I am much
    afraid it is only too true.</p>

    <p>As in your letter you ask me how it is that you no longer
    hear me say, &ldquo;I should like to be like this or like
    that&rdquo; <i>the fact is</i> that in my opinion those who
    proclaim most loudly that they &ldquo;want to be like this or
    like that&rdquo; are the ones who try least to improve
    themselves.</p>

    <p>As a rule those who say it don't do it.</p>

    <p>If I should want to utter some such wish, I should hardly do
    it in the atmosphere of our present relations.</p>

    <p>So <i>this</i> is the cause - and seeing that I strenuously
    exert myself to improve my work there is no need for me to be
    forever lapsing into wishful exclamations.</p>

    <p>I am sorry you did not send L'Illustration, for I have
    followed Renouard's work pretty regularly, and for many years I
    have saved up what he did for L'Illustration. And this is one
    of the most splendid, which I think would delight you too.</p>

    <p>When one orders the old Illustrations in the bookshops, at
    least here, one does not get them. I do wish you could get it
    for me. If it is too much trouble for you, then forget it, but
    heaven knows it is not so much trouble after all.</p>

    <p>And - apres tout - please note that with regard to that
    suspiciousness, and what I wrote you by way of rejoinder, this
    was not done so much because I won't suffer you and others to
    think whatever they like of me, but I cautioned you that it
    would give you little satisfaction if your character congealed
    in that mold.</p>

    <p>Considering that you say repeatedly that you know me better
    than others do, and that it still all ends in suspicion, then
    it is serious enough for me to protest against it, to protest
    firstly against that &ldquo;knowing me so well,&rdquo; and
    secondly against &ldquo;being suspicious.&rdquo; I went through
    such an affair with Father - I decline to start all over again
    with Father No. II.</p>

    <p>If I had resisted Father from the start instead of remaining
    silent, nothing much would have happened.</p>

    <p>So don't resent me telling you unreservedly what I think of
    it. That is better for both of us. <label content="feelings.ambition">And for the rest, old
    fellow, I think I am working a bit too hard to doubt that it
    will not be long before I shall be able somewhat to lighten the
    financial burden I am imposing on you. Maybe it will take
    longer than I think agreeable, to you as well as to me, but
    plodding on is a way that will not lead to complete
    failure.</label></p>

    <p>And if I insist on taking vigorous measures, it is to
    obviate the possibility of quarreling. For the
    <i>possibility</i> of a quarrel is gone at the very moment I
    find the means to cover my financial needs. Then my work will
    no longer be at issue, and now it is.</p>

    <p>Therefore don't despair. But now it's wretched for both of
    us. *</p>

    <p>Thanks for the remittance.</p>

    <p>Goodbye.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>* And to me my work is valuable; I must paint a lot - and
    therefore I am continually in want of models, which - at a time
    when my work is difficult and exhausting - is an additional
    reason for thinking it rather dismal to get suspicions in
    exchange. Never mind, it is a period I have to go through, and
    one does not paint in order to have an easy time of it.</p>
