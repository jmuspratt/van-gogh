  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your letter today, and also one from friend
    Rappard in the same mail. Let me begin by thanking you for the
    money.</p>

    <p>And let me add at once that I appreciate it that both you
    and Rappard approve of my coming here. This gave me courage at
    a moment when I myself was hopelessly discouraged about my
    coming here, and bitterly regretted it,<label content="attitude.father"> because on my part I
    perceived deep in the background of all the discussions I had
    with Father a je ne sais quoi of cold reticence over
    reconciliation, a cold evasiveness, which made me desperate
    because I saw that there would remain a cancerous root which
    would later make everything as impossible as in the past.</label></p>

    <p>But your letter and a very intelligent, very kind, very
    cordial letter from friend Rappard, and both your opinions that
    my journey hither might bring about some good, have induced me
    not to consider the case as lost yet, but to practice patience
    and wisdom.</p>

    <p>Have patience with me, brother, and do not suspect me of ill
    will.</p>

    <p>As for me, in many respects I know Father very intimately
    and thoroughly, and in the matter we are faced with it is
    impossible for me to leave things as they are. I had to get
    Father's opinion about this and that in order to compare it
    with certain precedents. For instance, I directed the
    conversation to subjects that had nothing to do with the matter
    in question, and then I got enough troubles.</p>

    <p>Do you know, your advice &ldquo;do not speak to them about
    certain things&rdquo; makes me think you refer to one
    particular thing, of which you take a correct view.</p>

    <p>But in reality that question of long ago was of the utmost
    importance (at least to me personally, I mean) - entering upon
    a new future with Father is once again a highly important
    thing, which nobody can ask me to engage upon, leaving things
    as they are.</p>

    <p>At the moment, particularly after the receipt of your
    letter, Father and I are on the best possible terms, and Father
    is not even disinclined to make certain arrangements.</p>

    <p>Besides, I want you to know I quite agree with you that they
    mean well - I do not suspect them of consciously <i>wishing</i>
    any adversity to befall me, although at times they bring it on
    me, or of <i>intentionally</i> putting obstructions in my way,
    although occasionally I am thwarted by them (&ldquo;not without
    good intentions,&rdquo; as Mauve would express it). But
    Father's character is highly variable and at the same time
    highly obstinate - (I know, most people do not know this) -
    Father's character is dark (rayon noir, I once reminded you),
    Father has a very narrow-minded or rather icy cold quality. I
    cannot express this, I can only feel it. I have often thought
    this problem over, I have paid a great deal of attention to
    Father, I know Father from various angles, very often I have
    tried to come to an agreement with Father, yet I <i>do not</i>
    think Father <i>good</i><i>.</i> I <i>cannot</i> declare that I
    think Father straightforward or simple or clear-headed
    enough.</p>

    <p>And now there is, and there will remain, a je ne sais quoi
    that worries me, and at the back of it all I am aware of the
    same fatal atmosphere as in the past.</p>

    <p>I was struck by the fact, Theo, that friend Rappard
    <i>now</i> writes that he had perceived that during the summer
    of the year I stayed at Etten I changed so much (it was then
    that I met her). And at the same time he hints that he
    understands <i>something</i> happened then, <i>though he does
    not know what</i><i>.</i> As I see it, Father and Mother and
    some others acted with very little delicacy at the time.</p>

    <p>If you should be able to agree with me on that, Theo, I
    should like to say to you, They show the same lack of delicacy
    now, and you should know something of it.</p>

    <p>So, although you need not attach much importance to some
    conversations with Father in the beginning, by which I only
    attempted to discover what Father thought of things, although
    all this means nothing, and at the present moment some
    arrangement might he made, which in many respects would make my
    work easier for me and give me the inner quiet to work, yet I
    see at the outset a je ne sais quoi, especially in Father,
    which fills me with anxiety, a heavy, still anxiety about the
    future.</p>

    <p>Keeping the peace with Father is a hard job. Once again I
    understand my own rebellious attitude in the previous period. I
    do not say it will lead to nothing, but I point out - it will
    be difficult. You will point out to me what I know full well
    myself, that in many respects I personally am very difficult to
    deal with. Yes, that is true, and I must take it into account,
    too. There is an excuse for me, and that is the passion and the
    frequent absorption which everyone who paints, writes, or
    composes must needs have.</p>

    <p>Does the same apply to Father? No - it is something else. If
    you should say, But Father is also a thinker and a writer -
    then I answer, I wish he were this in another way, for now I
    cannot call him happy. I say this more sadly than you may
    think; what I say <i>is serious</i><i>.</i> Is it impossible
    for you to enter into my feelings?</p>

    <p>I wrote you my last letter in a moment's desperation, of
    which the real purport was, &ldquo;I <i>cannot</i> do it after
    all.&rdquo; And I thought a decisive separation from Father,
    irrevocable and with &eacute;clat, the only thing I could do.
    &ldquo;If I do not do this, I should seem to be of one mind
    with a person whose principles I do not even respect, and I
    cannot stand the least appearance of being in agreement with
    him, for I am dead against him, absolutely in opposition to
    him.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But now today I received your letter, and at the same time a
    letter from Rappard, written in a tone which I can understand
    and appreciate. And after another discussion with Father, we
    have arrived at a provisional arrangement and calmness.</p>

    <p>A calmness which perhaps is &ldquo;It,&rdquo; but which to a
    far greater extent is not &ldquo;It.&rdquo; Que faire?</p>

    <p>I hereby declare that, for myself, I agree with Rappard when
    he says, &ldquo;Stay at home for a <i>long</i> time&rdquo; - he
    stresses this.</p>

    <p>There are a lot of reasons for this, Theo. Oh, if only you
    could see all that I see in it - how much security it might
    grant us for the future! - I hope it will prove to be
    possible.</p>

    <p>In Father's case there is an eternal contrast between what
    he says and what he does, but it took me a long time to
    discover it and to understand that usually Father is not
    conscious of it, so that one is often unable to decide whether
    he really wanted to do what he actually did. I shall tell you
    frankly, brother, what I think of it. Father does not always
    know what he <i>does</i> - though he chooses his words
    awfully systematically, his actions are most haphazard.</p>

    <p>In short, <i>it will be a hard job</i> to get good results
    from my stay here.</p>

    <p>However, the circumstances are such as to make it urgently
    necessary that an arrangement is brought about that will really
    be carried through.</p>

    <p>I have proposed that the room that can most easily be spared
    shall be used to keep my things in, and if necessary as a
    studio, in case not only <i>I</i> but <i>you and I</i> think it
    necessary and suitable that I work at home for a time,
    especially when there are financial reasons to force us to it.
    Business is business, and it is clear enough to you as well as
    to me that this is a good arrangement.</p>

    <p>I have been too long without this resting place, and I think
    that it must be settled in this way if we want to succeed in
    our enterprise.</p>

    <p>I believe it is possible, and I shall have the courage to
    start it when you and I agree that we must carry it through and
    settle that you will not be vexed with me if, in case of some
    disagreement with Father, I do not take it as seriously as I
    did two years ago.</p>

    <p>I will go my own way quietly and follow your advice
    <i>not</i>to speak with Father about several things provided
    only that I find in you the person to whom I <i>can</i> speak
    about them, and to whom I can say, I should like to do this or
    that, for this or that reason.</p>

    <p><i>Then</i> I <i>can</i> leave Father out of it, and
    <i>not</i> discuss the problems with Father. But it was
    necessary to break the ice, and this I did by going to Nuenen,
    and on that occasion I <i>had</i> <i>to</i> have an explanation
    with Father; however, <i>I am going to leave it at
    that</i>.</p>

    <p>I can tell you now that I have succeeded in getting Father's
    permission to fix a room here.</p>

    <p>If you approve of it, <i>this will become my regular
    storeroom and my studio in times when we have no money to be
    elsewhere</i>. And about further arrangements and business, I
    will not speak first with Father but with you - and you and I
    together will get Father so far that things will steadily
    improve in the long run too.</p>

    <p>I think you will approve of my having insisted on getting
    some fixed arrangement. I think it <i>decidedly a good
    thing</i> that I shall have a studio here (though I shall not
    always be in that studio).</p>

    <p>So let's stick to that, and let this letter, and not the
    last one, be our starting point. Well, brother, I am only
    writing you on this one subject, but your letting me know what
    you think of the Paris trade is very important to me. I
    <i>shall let you do whatever you want to do, even in case you
    should turn to painting, for in the latter case I am convinced
    you would land on your feet</i><i>.</i></p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Yes - que faire? I tell you I do not choose to go through
    the same experiences as two years ago. <i>It does not depend on
    me alone</i> (no more than it depended <i>on me alone</i> at
    the time) to keep the peace. <i>Can, must</i> one keep the
    peace with Father?</p>

    <p>Perhaps you do not understand this - my even saying
    &ldquo;must,&rdquo; my going so far as to say that. I shall
    give you an example: if they should reproach you, Rappard, or
    me with something - suppose <i>undeservedly</i> - we should
    never budge, we should answer back, and we should make them
    feel our nails a little. But because we are what we are, we
    should <i>never</i> say, You must not reproach me with
    anything. We should say, <i>Reproach me as much as you like, I
    am a match for you</i><i>.</i> Father sees sacrilege in
    observations <i>that are not reproaches at all</i>,
    observations unavoidable when discussing things. Observations
    that one should never avoid if they refer to things about which
    an understanding must be arrived at before one engages in an
    enterprise. Proudhon says, &ldquo;La femme est la
    d&eacute;solation du juste&rdquo; - I think one can feel and
    understand this pronouncement, although one does not claim to
    be &ldquo;un juste&rdquo; oneself, or to be looked upon as
    such. Although in general a clergyman, and in particular
    Father, is certainly not a <i>woman</i>, there is something
    equally unutterably hopeless in his way of speaking and
    acting.</p>

    <p>A phenomenon I have often tried to analyze, but which
    remains a mystery to me, for which I can give no other and no
    more correct definition than Hugo's words: &ldquo;Il a le rayon
    noir,&rdquo; or the words of somebody else, &ldquo;The gentlest
    of all cruel men.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I say this to explain what I think, and in order to throw
    light on the problem which we face. <i>You</i> will gradually
    have begun to understand that usually my mind is calm.</p>

    <p>But now, what is to be done? If it were possible, it would
    be an excellent thing if I could get a studio at home. In
    Rappard's case things went marvellously well, and Rappard
    writes me, &ldquo;I considered it <i>your greatest
    misfortune</i> that you could not live at home.&rdquo; And this
    is true, and I felt it terribly, not only afterward, but also
    at the moment, two years ago now, when I had to face it. Father
    did not do this intentionally - I say Father has little
    delicacy of feeling, and even now, although I at last told him
    so for the first time, Father does not yet know that it was a
    great difficulty for me. Father still says - and this is
    something so icy cold that I shudder when I think of it -
    Father says after two years <i>that in the past he acted
    according to his convictions and principles</i><i>.</i> An
    ordinary person, you or I, if we had done something like that,
    we should, I believe - I hope - I trust - have already
    regretted it for a long, long time, whether it was our fault or
    not. If you say Father did not mean to do so much harm, it may
    be true, but what one means to do is one thing, and the result
    of what one does is another. However, Father's convictions are
    undoubtedly well-intentioned and all that - but as for myself I
    hope his Honour is not going to acquire new convictions of the
    same kind.</p>

    <p>[Enclosed in letter 348] What Father is like you may see
    from what he went on to say, for instance, after stating that
    he could not take back anything of what he did in the past and
    so on, which in fact embodies a basic implacability. He
    -immediately followed up with, &ldquo;But we do not lack
    indulgence.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Indulgence combined with implacability.</p>

    <p>This too is in reality a &ldquo;d&eacute;solation du
    juste.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In short, <i>this</i> is what Father is - he is &ldquo;<i>a
    stupid one</i>.&rdquo; To speak with whom is unutterably
    hopeless for me.</p>

    <p>If Father were not Father, I should not worry, but can one
    always act as if one's father did not exist? This is impossible
    for me too.</p>

    <p>But the fact is that I am not the man to swallow
    &ldquo;indulgence&rdquo; when basically I see
    implacability.</p>

    <p>Every once in a while C. M. also used to trot out the word
    &ldquo;unpardonable.&rdquo; And people like Father and C. M.
    stick to it - and act upon it year after year - save for
    &ldquo;indulgence.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Bah, I think it's utterly disgusting. Approving of it, and
    entering into it - no! Then I prefer a refreshing row, and I
    personally will not mince words. You see what I am, brother,
    and think whatever you like, but never suppose that I will have
    anything to do with that sophism of indulgence together with
    implacability.</p>

    <p>I want to be reconciled &ldquo;<i>efficaciously&rdquo;</i> -
    <i>effectively</i><i>,</i> thoroughly, else I prefer an open
    disagreement, a conflict, in such a way that the world can
    perceive it - ah well&hellip;.</p>

    <p><i>Vivre tout haut</i> is simply one's duty - one should not
    act like the Jesuits and their kind.</p>
