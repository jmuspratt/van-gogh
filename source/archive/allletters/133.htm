  <body>
    <p>My Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am writing to you rather reluctantly because, for a good
    many reasons, I have kept silent for such a long time. To some
    extent you have become a stranger to me, and I to you perhaps
    more than you think. It is probably better for us not to go on
    like that. It is probable that I would not have written to you
    even now, were it not that I feel obliged, compelled, to do so
    - because, be it noted, you yourself have compelled me to.</p>

    <p>I heard in Etten that you had sent 50 francs for me. Well, I
    have accepted them. With reluctance, of course, with a feeling
    of some despondency, of course, but I have reached a sort of
    impasse, am in trouble, what else can I do? And so I am writing
    to thank you.</p>

    <p>As you may know, I am back in the Borinage. Father said he
    would prefer me to stay somewhere near Etten, but I refused and
    I believe I was right to do so. To the family, I have,
    willy-nilly, become a more or less objectionable and shady sort
    of character, at any rate a bad lot. How then could I then be
    of any use to anyone? And so I am inclined to think the best
    and most sensible solution all round would be for me to go away
    and to keep my distance, to cease to be, as it were. What the
    moulting season is for birds - the time when they lose their
    feathers - setbacks, misfortune and hard times are for us human
    beings. You can cling on to the moulting season, you can also
    emerge from it reborn, but it must not be done in public.</p>

    <p>The thing is far from amusing, not very exhilarating, and so
    one should take care to keep out of the way. Well, so be
    it.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">Now, though it is a fairly hopeless task to regain the trust
    of an entire family, one which has perhaps never been wholly
    weaned from prejudice and other equally honourable and
    respectable qualities, I am not entirely without hope that, bit
    by bit, slowly but surely, the good relationship between one
    and all may be restored. In the first place I should be glad to
    see this good relationship - to put it no more strongly than
    that - restored at least between Father and me, and further, I
    set great store by seeing it restored between the two of us. A
    good relationship is infinitely preferable to a
    misunderstanding.</label></p>

    <p>Now I must trouble you with certain abstract matters, hoping
    that you will listen to them patiently. I am a man of passions,
    capable of and given to doing more or less outrageous things
    for which I sometimes feel a little sorry. Every so often I say
    or do something too hastily, when it would have been better to
    have shown a little more patience. Other people also act rashly
    at times, I think.</p>

    <p>This being the case, what can be done about it? Should I
    consider myself a dangerous person, unfit for anything? I think
    not. Rather, every means should be tried to put these very
    passions to good effect.</p>

    <p>To mention just one by way of an example, I have a more or
    less irresistible passion for books and the constant need to
    improve my mind, to study if you like, just as I have a need to
    eat bread. You will understand that. When I lived in other
    surroundings, surroundings full of pictures and works of art, I
    conceived a violent, almost fanatical passion for those
    surroundings, as you know. And I do not regret that, and even
    now, <i>far from home, I often feel homesick for the land of
    pictures</i></p>

    <p>You may remember that I knew very well (and it may be that I
    know it still) what Rembrandt was or what Millet was or Jules
    Dupr&eacute; or Delacroix or Millais or Matthijs Maris.</p>

    <p>Well, today I am no longer in those surroundings, yet they
    say that what is known as the soul never dies but lives on for
    ever, continuing to seek for ever and again.</p>

    <p>So instead of succumbing to my homesickness I told myself:
    your land, your fatherland, is all around. <label content="psychology.depression">So instead of giving
    in to despair I chose active melancholy, in so far as I was
    capable of activity, in other words I chose the kind of
    melancholy that hopes, that strives and that seeks, in
    preference to the melancholy that despairs numbly and in
    distress. </label>I accordingly made a more or less serious study of
    the books within my reach, such as the Bible and Michelet's La
    r&eacute;volution Fran&ccedil;aise, and then last winter
    Shakespeare and a little Victor Hugo and Dickens and Beecher
    Stowe and recently &AElig;schylus and then various less
    classical writers, a few great minor masters. You know, don't
    you, that Fabritius and Bida are counted among the minor
    masters?</p>

    <p>Now anyone who becomes absorbed in all this is sometimes
    considered outrageous, `shocking,' sinning more or less
    unwillingly against certain forms and customs and proprieties.
    It is a pity that people take that amiss.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">You know, for example, that I have often neglected my
    appearance. I admit it, and I also admit that it is `shocking.'</label>
    But look here, lack of money and poverty have something to do
    with it too, as well as a profound disillusionment, and
    besides, it is sometimes a good way of ensuring the solitude
    you need, of concentrating more or less on whatever study you
    are immersed in. One essential study is that of medicine. There
    is scarcely anybody who does not try to acquire some knowledge
    of it, who does not at least try to grasp what it is about (and
    you see, I still know absolutely nothing about it). And all
    these things absorb you, preoccupy you, set you dreaming,
    musing and thinking.</p>

    <p>Now for the past five years or so, I don't know how long
    exactly, I have been more or less without permanent employment,
    wandering from pillar to post. You will say, ever since such
    and such a time you have been going downhill, you have been
    feeble, you have done nothing. Is that entirely true?</p>

    <p>What is true is that I have at times earned my own crust of
    bread, and at other times a friend has given it to me out of
    the goodness of his heart. I have lived whatever way I could,
    for better or for worse, taking things just as they came. It is
    true that I have forfeited the trust of various people, it is
    true that my financial affairs are in a sorry state, it is true
    that the future looks rather bleak, it is true that I might
    have done better, it is true that I have wasted time when it
    comes to earning a living, it is true that my studies are in a
    fairly lamentable and appalling state, and that my needs are
    greater, infinitely greater than my resources. But does that
    mean going downhill and doing nothing?</p>

    <p>You might say, but why didn't you go through with
    university, continue as they wanted you to? To that I can only
    reply that it was too expensive, and besides, the future then
    looked no better than it does now, along the path I am now
    taking.</p>

    <p>And I must continue to follow the path I take now. If I do
    nothing, if I study nothing, if I cease searching, then, woe is
    me, I am lost. That is how I look at it - keep going, keep
    going come what may.</p>

    <p>But what is your final goal, you may ask. That goal will
    become clearer, will emerge slowly but surely, much as the
    rough draught turns into a sketch, and the sketch into a
    painting through the serious work done on it, through the
    elaboration of the original vague idea and through the
    consolidation of the first fleeting and passing thought.</p>

    <p>You should know that it is the same with evangelists as it
    is with artists. There is an old academic school, often odious
    and tyrannical, the `abomination of desolation', in short, men
    who dress, as it were, in a suit of steel armour, a cuirass, of
    prejudice and convention. When they are in charge, it is they
    who hand out the jobs and try, with much red tape, to keep them
    for their proteges and to exclude the man with an open
    mind.</p>

    <p>Their God is like the God of Shakespeare's drunken Falstaff,
    &ldquo;the inside of a church.&rdquo; Indeed, by a strange
    coincidence, some evangelical (???) gentlemen have the same
    view of matters spiritual as that drunkard (which might
    surprise them somewhat were they capable of human emotion). But
    there is little fear that their blindness will ever turn into
    insight.</p>

    <p>This is a bad state of affairs for anyone who differs from
    them and protests with heart and soul and all the indignation
    he can muster. For my part, I hold those academicians who are
    not like these academicians in high esteem, but the decent ones
    are thinner on the ground than you might think.</p>

    <p>Now, one of the reasons why I have no regular job, and why I
    have not had a regular job for years, is quite simply that my
    ideas differ from those of the gentlemen who hand out the jobs
    to individuals who think as they do. It is not just a question
    of my appearance, which is what they have sanctimoniously
    reproached me with. It goes deeper, I do assure you.</p>

    <p>I am telling you all this not to complain, not to make
    excuses for matters in which I may perhaps have been somewhat
    at fault, but simply to tell you the following: during your
    final visit last summer when we were walking together near that
    abandoned mineshaft which they call &ldquo;La
    Sorci&egrave;re,&rdquo; you reminded me of another walk we once
    took at another time near the old canal and the mill at
    Rijswijk, and, you said, we used to agree about many things,
    but, you added, &ldquo;You have changed since then, you are no
    longer the same.&rdquo; Well, that is not entirely true. What
    has changed is that my life then was less difficult and my
    future seemingly less gloomy, but as far as my inner self, my
    way of looking at things and of thinking is concerned, that has
    not changed. But if there has indeed been a change, then it is
    that I think, believe and love more seriously now what I
    thought, believed and loved even then.</p>

    <p>So you would be mistaken should you continue to think that I
    have become less keen on, say, Rembrandt, Millet, or Delacroix
    or whoever or whatever, for the reverse is the case, but there
    are many different things worth believing and loving, you see -
    there is something of Rembrandt in Shakespeare, something of
    Correggio or of Sarto in Michelet and something of Delacroix in
    Victor Hugo, and there is also something of Rembrandt in the
    Gospel or, if you prefer, something of the Gospel in Rembrandt,
    it comes to much the same thing, provided you understand it
    properly, do not try to distort it and bear in mind that the
    elements of the comparisons are not intended to detract in any
    way from the merits of the original individuals.</p>

    <p>And in Bunyan there is something of M. Maris or of Millet, a
    reality that, in a manner of speaking, is more real than
    reality itself, something hitherto unknown that, if only you
    can read it, will tell you untold things. And in Beecher Stowe
    there is something of Ary Scheffer.</p>

    <p><?showImage("149_V-T_1330");?>
    </p>

    <p>Now, if you can forgive someone for immersing himself in
    pictures, perhaps you will also grant that the love of books is
    as sacred as that of Rembrandt, indeed, I believe that the two
    complement each other.</p>

    <p>I very much admire the portrait of a man by Fabritius that
    we stood looking at for a long time in the gallery in Haarlem
    one day when we took another walk together. Admittedly, I am as
    fond of Dickens's `Richard Cartone' [Sydney Carton] in his
    Paris &amp; Londres in 1793 [A Tale of Two Cities], and I could
    point to other particularly gripping characters in other books
    with a more or less striking resemblance. And I think that
    Kent, a character in Shakespeare's &ldquo;King Lear,&rdquo; is
    as noble and distinguished a man as that figure by Th. de
    Keyser, though Kent and King Lear are reputed to have lived
    much earlier.</p>

    <p>Let me stop there, but my God, how beautiful Shakespeare is,
    who else is as mysterious as he is; his language and method are
    like a brush trembling with excitement and ecstasy. But one
    must learn to read, just as one must learn to see and learn to
    live.</p>

    <p>So please don't think that I am renouncing anything, I am
    reasonably faithful in my unfaithfulness and though I have
    changed, I am the same, and what preys on my mind is simply
    this one question: what am I good for, could I not be of
    service or use in some way, how can I become more knowledgeable
    and study some subject or other in depth? That is what keeps
    preying on my mind, you see, and then one feels imprisoned by
    poverty, barred from taking part in this or that project and
    all sorts of necessities are out of one's reach. As a result
    one cannot rid oneself of melancholy, one feels emptiness where
    there might have been friendship and sublime and genuine
    affection, and one feels dreadful disappointment gnawing at
    one's spiritual energy, fate seems to stand in the way of
    affection or one feels a wave of disgust welling up inside. And
    then one says &ldquo;How long, my God!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, that's how it is, can you tell what goes on within by
    looking at what happens without? There may be a great fire in
    our soul, but no one ever comes to warm himself by it, all that
    passers-by can see is a little smoke coming out of the chimney,
    and they walk on.</p>

    <p>All right, then, what is to be done, should one tend that
    inward fire, turn to oneself for strength, wait patiently - yet
    with how much impatience! - wait, I say, for the moment when
    someone who wants to comes and sits down beside one's fire and
    perhaps stays on? Let him who believes in God await the moment
    that will sooner or later arrive.</p>

    <p>Well, right now it seems that things are going very badly
    for me, have been doing so for some considerable time, and may
    continue to do so well into the future. But it is possible that
    everything will get better after it has all seemed to go wrong.
    I am not counting on it, it may never happen, but if there
    should be a change for the better I should regard that as a
    gain, I should rejoice, I should say, at last! So there <i>was
    something after all!</i></p>

    <p>But, you will say, what a dreadful person you are, with your
    impossible religious notions and idiotic scruples. If my ideas
    are impossible or idiotic then I would like nothing better than
    to be rid of them. But this is roughly the way I see things. In
    Le Philosophe sous les Toits by Souvestre you can read what a
    man of the people, a simple craftsman, pitiful if you will,
    thinks of his country: &ldquo;Tu n'as peut-&ecirc;tre jamais
    pens&eacute; &agrave; ce que c'est la patrie, reprit-il, en me
    posant une main sur l'&eacute;paule; c'est tout ce qui
    t'entoure, tout ce qui t'a &eacute;lev&eacute; et nourri, tout
    ce que tu as aim&eacute;. Cette campagne que tu vois, ces
    maisons, ces arbres, ces jeunes filles qui passent l&agrave; en
    riant, c'est la patrie! Les lois qui te prot&egrave;gent, le
    pain qui paye ton travail, les paroles que tu &eacute;changes,
    la joie et la tristesse qui te viennent des hommes et des
    choses parmi lesquels tu vis, c'est la patrie! La petite
    chambre o&ugrave; tu as autrefois vu ta m&egrave;re, les
    souvenirs qu'elle t'a laiss&eacute;s, la terre o&ugrave; elle
    repose, c'est la patrie! Tu la vois, tu la respires partout!
    Figure toi, tes affections et tes besoins, tes souvenirs et ta
    reconnaissance, r&eacute;unis tout &ccedil;a sous un seul nom
    et ce nom sera la patrie.&rdquo; [You may never have thought
    what your country really is, he continued, placing his hand on
    my shoulder; it is everything around you, everything that has
    raised and nourished you, everything that you have loved. This
    countryside that you see; these houses, these trees, these
    young girls laughing as they pass, that is your country! The
    laws that protect you, the bread that rewards your labour, the
    words you speak, the joy and sorrow that come from the people
    and things in whose midst you live, that is your country! The
    little room where you used in days gone by to see your mother,
    the memories she left you, the earth in which she rests, that
    is your country! You see it, you breathe it, everywhere!
    Imagine your rights and your duties, your affections and your
    needs, your memories and your gratitude, gather all that
    together under a single name, and that name will be your
    country.]</p>

    <p>In the same way I think that everything that is really good
    and beautiful, the inner, moral, spiritual and sublime beauty
    in men and their works, comes from God, and everything that is
    bad and evil in the works of men and in men is not from God,
    and God does not approve of it.</p>

    <p>But I cannot help thinking that the best way of knowing God
    is to love many things. Love this friend, this person, this
    thing, whatever you like, and you will be on the right road to
    understanding Him better, that is what I keep telling myself.
    But you must love with a sublime, genuine, profound sympathy,
    with devotion, with intelligence, and you must try all the time
    to understand Him more, better and yet more. That will lead to
    God, that will lead to an unshakeable faith.</p>

    <p>To take an example: one man will love Rembrandt, genuinely,
    and that man will surely know that there is a God, he will
    really believe it. Another will make a thorough study of the
    French Revolution - he will not be an unbeliever, he will see
    that there is a supreme authority that manifests itself in
    great affairs. Yet another has recently attended a free course
    of lectures at the great university of sorrow and has heeded
    the things he saw with his eyes and heard with his ears, and
    has reflected upon them. He too will come to believe in the end
    and will perhaps have learned more than he can tell.</p>

    <p>Try to grasp the essence of what the great artists, the
    serious masters, say in their masterpieces, and you will again
    find God in them. One man has written or said it in a book,
    another in a painting. Just read the Bible and the Gospel, that
    will start you thinking, thinking about many things, thinking
    about everything, well then, think about many things, think
    about everything, that will lift your thoughts above the
    humdrum despite yourself. We know how to read, so let us
    read!</p>

    <p>Now then, you may well have bouts of being a little
    absent-minded, a little dreamy, indeed there are some who
    become too absent-minded, a little too dreamy. That may indeed
    have happened with me, but all in all that is my own fault,
    maybe there as a reason for it, perhaps I was lost in thought
    for one reason or another, anxious, worried, but one gets over
    that in the end. The dreamer sometimes falls into the doldrums,
    but is said to emerge from them again. And the absent-minded
    person also makes up for it with bouts of perspicacity.
    Sometimes he is a person whose right to exist has a
    justification that is not always immediately obvious to you, or
    more usually, you may absent-mindedly allow it to slip from
    your mind. Someone who has been wandering about for a long
    time, tossed to and fro on a stormy sea, will in the end reach
    his destination. Someone who has seemed to be good for nothing,
    unable to fill any job, any appointment, will find one in the
    end and, energetic and capable, will prove himself quite
    different from what he seemed at first.</p>

    <p>I am writing somewhat at random, writing whatever flows from
    my pen. I should be very happy if you could see in me something
    more than a kind of fain&eacute;ant [idler]. For there is a
    great difference between one idler and another idler. There is
    someone who is an idler out of laziness and lack of character,
    owing to the baseness of his nature. If you like, you may take
    me for one of those. Then there is the other kind of idler, the
    idler despite himself, who is inwardly consumed by a great
    longing for action who does nothing because his hands are tied,
    because he is, so to speak, imprisoned somewhere, because he
    lacks what he needs to be productive, because disastrous
    circumstances have brought him forcibly to this end. Such a one
    does not always know what he can do, but he nevertheless
    instinctively feels, I am good for something! My existence is
    not without reason! I know that I could be a quite a different
    person! How can I be of use, how can I be of service? There is
    something inside me, but what can it be? He is quite another
    idler. If you like you may take me for one of those.</p>

    <p>A caged bird in spring knows perfectly well that there is
    some way in which he should be able to serve. He is well aware
    that there is something to be done, but he is unable to do it.
    What is it? He cannot quite remember, but then he gets a vague
    inkling and he says to himself, &ldquo;The others are building
    their nests and hatching their young and bringing them
    up,&rdquo; and then he bangs his head against the bars of the
    cage. But the cage does not give way and the bird is maddened
    by pain. &ldquo;What a idler,&rdquo; says another bird passing
    by - what an idler. Yet the prisoner lives and does not die.
    There are no outward signs of what is going on inside him; he
    is doing well, he is quite cheerful in the sunshine.</p>

    <p>But then the season of the great migration arrives, an
    attack of melancholy. He has everything he needs, say the
    children who tend him in his cage - but he looks out, at the
    heavy thundery sky, and in his heart of hearts he rebels
    against his fate. I am caged, I am caged and you say I need
    nothing, you idiots! I have everything I need, indeed! Oh!
    please give me the freedom to be a bird like other birds!</p>

    <p>A kind of idler of a person resembles that kind of idler of
    a bird. And people are often unable to do anything, imprisoned
    as they are in I don't know what kind of terrible, terrible, oh
    such terrible cage.</p>

    <p>I do know that there is a release, the belated release. A
    justly or unjustly ruined reputation, poverty, disastrous
    circumstances, misfortune, they all turn you into a prisoner.
    You cannot always tell what keeps you confined, what immures
    you, what seems to bury you, and yet you can feel those elusive
    bars, railings, walls. Is all this illusion, imagination? I
    don't think so. And then one asks: My God! will it be for long,
    will it be for ever, will it be for eternity?</p>

    <p>Do you know what makes the prison disappear? Every deep,
    genuine affection. Being friends, being brothers, loving, that
    is what opens the prison, with supreme power, by some magic
    force. Without these one stays dead. But whenever affection is
    revived, there life revives. Moreover, the prison is sometimes
    called prejudice, misunderstanding, fatal ignorance of one
    thing or another, suspicion, false modesty.</p>

    <p>But to change the subject - if I have come down in the
    world, you have in a different way come up in it. And if I have
    forfeited sympathy, you have gained it. I am glad of that, I
    say that it in all sincerity, and it will always give me
    pleasure. If you lacked seriousness or consideration, I would
    be fearful that it might not last, but since I think that you
    are very serious and very considerate, I tend to believe it
    will!</p>

    <p>But if you could see me as something other than a idler of
    the bad sort, I should be very happy.</p>

    <p>For the rest, if I can ever do anything for you, be of some
    use to you, know that I am at your disposal. Now that I have
    accepted what you have given me, you are, should I be able to
    render you some service, in a position to ask me. It would make
    me happy, and I should take it a sign of trust. We have moved
    rather far apart and may in certain respects have perhaps
    different views, but some time, some day, one of us may be of
    service to the other.</p>

    <p>For now I shake your hand, thanking you once again for
    having been so good to me. If, one of these days, you feel like
    writing, my address is, chez Ch. Decrucq, Rue du Pavillon 8,
    Cuesmes, near Mons, and know that it will do me good to hear
    from you.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
