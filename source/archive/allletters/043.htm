    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Just another few words to cheer myself as well as you. I
    advised you to dispose of your books, and advise it still. Be
    sure to do it, it will give you peace of mind. But at the same
    time be careful not to become narrow-minded, or afraid of
    reading what is well written, quite the contrary, such writings
    are a <i>source of comfort in life.</i></p>

    <p>`Que toutes les choses qui sont v&eacute;ritables, toutes les
    choses qui sont honn&ecirc;tes, toutes les choses qui sont
    justes, tout les choses qui sont pures, toutes les choses qui
    sont amiables, tout les choses qui sont de bonne
    r&eacute;putation, et o&ugrave; il y a quelque vertu, et qui
    sont dignes de louange, que toutes ces choses occupent vos
    pens&eacute;es'. [Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things
    are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are
    pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
    good report; and if there be any virtue, and if there be any
    praise, think on these things.]</p>

    <p>Seek only for light and freedom and do not immerse yourself
    too deeply in the worldly <i>mire</i>.</p>

    <p>How I should like to have you here, to show you the
    Luxembourg and the Louvre, etc., but I have the feeling that
    you, too, will be coming here one day.</p>

    <p>I have had quite a good letter from Anna, I am sending it on
    to you, but please let me have it back when you have read
    it.</p>

    <p>Father once wrote to me, &ldquo;Do not forget the story of
    Icarus, who wanted to fly to the sun, and having reached a
    certain height lost his wings and fell into the sea.&rdquo; You
    may often feel that neither Anna nor I are what we hope to
    become and that we still lag a long way behind Father and other
    people, that we lack soundness and simplicity and sincerity.
    One does not become <i>simple</i> and true overnight. But let
    us persevere, <i>and above all have patience. He who believes,
    does not hasten</i>. Still, there is a difference between our
    desire to become Christians and that of Icarus to fly to the
    sun.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">To my mind, there
    is nothing wrong with having a reasonably
    strong body, so make sure you feed yourself properly, and if
    you feel very hungry sometimes, or rather, have a good
    appetite, then eat well. I assure you that that is what I do
    myself often enough, and <i>above all used to do</i>.
    Especially bread, in my opinion, my boy, and don't be too shy
    about it. &ldquo;Bread is the staff of life,&rdquo; the English
    say (although they like meat as well, on the whole far too
    much).</label></p>

    <p>And now, write again soon and about everyday matters, too,
    for a change. Take care of yourself and give my regards to
    anyone who asks about me. Let us hope we see each other in a
    month or two. I shake you warmly by the hand in my thoughts,
    and am always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
