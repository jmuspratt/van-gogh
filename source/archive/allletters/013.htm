  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter. My warm good wishes for a very
    happy New Year. I know you are doing well at The Hague, because
    Mr. Tersteeg told me so. I can see from your letter that you
    are taking a keen interest in art, and that's a good thing, old
    fellow. I'm glad you like Millet, Jacque, Schreyer, Lambinet,
    Frans Hals, etc., for as Mauve says, &ldquo;That's it.&rdquo;
    That painting by Millet, L'ang&eacute;lus du soir,
    &ldquo;that's it,&rdquo; indeed - that's magnificent, that's
    poetry. How I wish I could have another talk with you about
    art; but we'll just have to keep writing to each other about
    it. <i>Admire</i> as much as you can; most people <i>don't
    admire enough</i>.</p>

    <p>Here are the names of a few the painters I particularly
    like. Scheffer, Delaroche, H&eacute;bert, Hamon, Leys, Tissot,
    Lagye, Boughton, Millais, Thijs [Matthijs] Mans, De Groux, De
    Braekeleer, Jr., Millet, Jules Breton, Feyen-Perrin,
    Eug&egrave;ne Feyen, Brion, Jundt, George Saal, Isra&euml;ls,
    Anker, Knaus, Vautier, Jourdan, Jalabert, Antigna,
    Compte-Calix, Rochussen, Meissonier, Zamacois, Madrazo, Ziem,
    Boudin, G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, Fromentin, de Tournemine, Pasini,
    Decamps, Bonington, Diaz, Th. Rousseau, Troyon, Dupr&eacute;,
    Paul Huet, Corot, Jacque, Otto Weber, Daubigny, Wahlberg,
    Bernier, &Eacute;mile Breton, Chenu, C&eacute;sar de Cock,
    Mile. Collart, Bodmer, Koekkoek, Schelfhout, Weissenbruch, and
    last [but] not least, Maris and Mauve.</p>

    <p>But I could carry on like that for I don't know how long,
    and then there are still all the old masters, and I am sure I
    have forgotten some of the best of the modern ones.</p>

    <p>Do go on doing a lot of walking and keep up your love of
    nature, for that is the right way to understand art better and
    better. Painters understand nature and love her and <i>teach us
    to see</i>.</p>

    <p>And then there are painters who never do anything that is no
    good, who cannot do anything bad, just as there are ordinary
    people who can do nothing but good.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.people">I'm getting on very well here. I've got a delightful home
    and I'm finding it very pleasurable taking a look at London and
    the English way of life and the English people themselves,</label> and
    then I've got nature and art and poetry, and if that isn't
    enough, what is? But I haven't forgotten Holland and especially
    not The Hague and Brabant.</p>

    <p>We are busy at the office doing stocktaking, but it will all
    be over in 5 days, we got off more lightly than you did in The
    Hague.</p>

    <p>I hope that, like me, you had a happy Christmas.</p>

    <p>And so, my boy, best wishes and write to me soon, Je
    t'&eacute;cris un peu au hasard ce qui me vient dans ma plume
    [I have written to you in this manner just as it came into my
    pen], I hope you'll be able to make something of it.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, regards to everybody at work and to anybody else
    who asks after me, especially everybody at Aunt Fie's and at
    the Haanebeeks'.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I am enclosing a few lines for Mr. Roos.</p>
