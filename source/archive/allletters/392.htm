  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Enclosed are some more scratches of studies of heads. <label content="Theo.work">At
    home I heard you have had a good year, and had an offer of 1000
    francs a month, which you refused. I can understand that once
    at G. &amp; Co., you want to stay there; it was one of the
    first great houses, perhaps it might still be able to outlive
    many rivals.</label></p>

    <p>I think, however, that every year it will become more
    difficult to follow the routine which has hitherto been
    maintained in the art trade, and will it be possible to find a
    new method of doing business now? Perhaps not.</p>

    <p>And yet - unless new tactics are going to be employed -
    doesn't the danger threaten more every day that, because of the
    fall of some big firm or other, for instance, some things will
    drop in price, which drop will cause a panic all round? I
    really think this is not merely an imaginary danger. Prices
    have risen to their present height within a relatively short
    time - let's say, within forty years at the most. And would
    more time than that be necessary for them to tumble down the
    mountain? As a rule it is easier to go downhill than up. But
    for all that - there is something in art which will always make
    at least a chance of extending the buying public possible.
    Only, I repeat, will they create this new public? If not, I
    personally am afraid it will go down as fast as it has
    risen.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.apprehension">I've hardly ever begun a year with a gloomier aspect, in a
    gloomier mood, and I do not expect any future of success, but a
    future of strife.</label></p>

    <p>It is dreary outside, the fields a mass of lumps of black
    earth and some snow, with mostly days of mist and mire in
    between, the red sun in the evening and in the morning, crows,
    withered grass, and faded, rotting green, black shrubs, and the
    branches of the poplars and willows rigid, like wire, against
    the dismal sky. This is what I see in passing, and it is quite
    in harmony with the interiors, very gloomy, these dark winter
    days.</p>

    <p>It is also in harmony with the physiognomy of the peasants
    and weavers. I don't hear the latter complain, but they have a
    hard time of it. A weaver who works steadily, weaves, say, a
    piece of sixty yards a week. While he weaves, a woman must
    spool for him, that is, supply the shuttles with yarn, so there
    are two who work and have to live on it.</p>

    <p>On that piece of cloth he makes a net profit, for instance,
    of 4.50 guilders a week, and nowadays when he takes it to the
    manufacturer, he is often told that he cannot come with another
    piece for two weeks. So not only are wages low, but work is
    pretty scarce too.</p>

    <p>Consequently, there is often something agitated and restless
    about these people.</p>

    <p>It is a different spirit from that of the miners, among whom
    I lived during the year of strikes and many accidents. That was
    even worse, yet it is often pathetic here too; the people are
    quiet, and literally <i>nowhere</i> have I heard anything
    resembling rebellious speeches.</p>

    <p>But they look as little cheerful as the old cab horses or
    the sheep transported by steamer to England.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, I hope you will be able to send money, I have not
    quite a guilder left, and must have a model for a few hours
    more today, so tomorrow I shall be at a dead end, but maybe
    your letter will come.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
