    <p>PERSONAL MEMORIES OF VINCENT VAN GOGH DURING HIS STAY AT
    AMSTERDAM</p>

    <p>by Dr. M. B. Mendes da Costa</p>

    <p>It was probably in the year 1877 or thereabouts that the
    Reverend Mr. J. P. Stricker, a preacher universally respected
    in Amsterdam, asked me whether I was willing to give lessons in
    Latin and Greek to his cousin Vincent, son of the Reverend Mr.
    T. van Gogh, clergyman at Etten and De Hoeven, to prepare him
    for his matriculation. I was warned that I would not be dealing
    with any ordinary boy, and was apprised of his ways, so
    different from ordinary human behavior. However, this did not
    discourage me in the least, particularly as the Reverend Mr.
    Stricker spoke with much love of Vincent himself as well as of
    his parents.</p>

    <p>Our first meeting, of so much importance to the relationship
    between master and pupil, was very pleasant indeed. <label content="lifestyle.appearance">The
    seemingly reticent young man - our ages differed but little,
    for I was twenty-six then, and he was undoubtedly over twenty -
    immediately felt at home, and notwithstanding his lank reddish
    hair and his many freckles, his appearance was far from
    unattractive to me. In passing, let me say that it is not very
    clear to me why his sister speaks of his &ldquo;more or less
    rough exterior&rdquo;; it is possible that, since the time when
    I knew him, because of his untidiness and his growing a beard,
    his outward appearance lost something of its charming
    quaintness; but most decidedly it can never have been rough,
    neither his nervous hands, nor his countenance, which might
    have been considered homely, but which expressed so much and
    hid so much more.</label></p>

    <p>I succeeded in winning his confidence and friendship very
    soon, which was so essential in this case; and as his studies
    were prompted by the best of intentions, we made comparatively
    good progress in the beginning - I was soon able to let him
    translate an easy Latin author. Needless to say, he, who was so
    fanatically devout in those days, at once started using this
    little bit of Latin knowledge to read Thomas a Kempis in the
    original.</p>

    <p>So far everything went well, including mathematics, which he
    had begun studying with another master in the meantime; but
    after a short time the Greek verbs became too much for him.
    However I might set about it, whatever trick I might invent to
    enliven the lessons, it was no use. &ldquo;Mendes,&rdquo; he
    would say - we did not mister each other any more -
    &ldquo;Mendes, do you seriously believe that such horrors are
    indispensable to a man who wants to do what I want to do: give
    peace to poor creatures and reconcile them to their existence
    here on earth?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And I, who as his master naturally could not agree, but who
    felt in my heart of hearts that he - mind, I say <i>he</i>,
    Vincent van Gogh! - was quite right, I put up the most
    formidable defense I was capable of; but it was no use.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;John Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> is of much
    more use to me, and Thomas a Kempis and a translation of the
    Bible; and I don't want anything more.&rdquo; I really do not
    know how many times he told me this, nor how many times I went
    to the Reverend Mr. Stricker to discuss the matter, after which
    it was decided again and again that Vincent ought to have
    another try.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.masochism">But before long the trouble would start afresh, and then he
    would come to me in the morning with an announcement I knew so
    well, &ldquo;Mendes, last night I used the cudgel again,&rdquo;
    or, &ldquo;Mendes, last night I got myself locked out
    again.&rdquo; It should be observed that this was some sort of
    self-chastisement resorted to whenever he thought he had
    neglected a duty. In fact, during those days he lived in his
    uncle's house, Rear Admiral J. van Gogh, director and commander
    of the naval base at Amsterdam; the house was a big building
    inside the naval dockyard. Well, whenever Vincent felt that his
    thoughts had strayed further than they should have, he took a
    cudgel to bed with him and belabored his back with it; and
    whenever he was convinced he had forfeited the privilege of
    passing the night in his bed, he slunk out of the house
    unobserved at night, and then, when he came back and found the
    door double-locked, was forced to go and lie on the floor of a
    little wooden shed, without bed or blanket. He preferred to do
    this in winter, so that the punishment, which I am disposed to
    think arose from mental masochism, might be more severe.</label></p>

    <p>He knew quite well that I was displeased by such
    announcements on his part, and therefore, to appease me as much
    as possible, he would, either before his confession or the day
    after, go to the park which was then the Oosterbegraaf-plaats
    [East Cemetery], his favorite walk, in the early morning, and
    pick some snowdrops for me there, preferably from under the
    snow. At the time I was living in Jonas Daniel Meyer Square and
    had my study on the third floor.<label content="lifestyle.appearance"> In my mind's eye I can still
    see him come stepping across the square from the Nieuwe
    Herengracht Bridge, without an overcoat as additional
    self-chastisement; his books under his right arm, pressed
    firmly against his body, and his left hand clasping the bunch
    of snowdrops to his breast; his head thrust forward a little to
    the right, and on his face, because of the way his mouth
    drooped at the corners, a pervading expression of indescribable
    sadness and despair.</label> And when he had come upstairs, there would
    sound again that singular, profoundly melancholy, deep voice:
    &ldquo;Don't be mad at me, Mendes; I have brought you some
    little flowers again because you are so good to me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As far as I can see, to be angry under such circumstances
    would have been impossible for anybody, not just for me, who
    had soon discovered that in those days he was consumed by a
    desire to help the unfortunate. I had noticed it even in my own
    home, for not only did he show great interest in my deaf and
    dumb brother, but at the same time he always spoke kindly to
    and about an aunt of ours whom we had taken in, an impecunious,
    slightly deformed woman who was slow-witted, and spoke with
    difficulty, thus provoking the mockery of many people. This
    aunt tried to make herself useful by &ldquo;minding the
    bell,&rdquo; and as soon as she saw Vincent approach, she would
    run as quickly as her short old legs would carry her to the
    street door in order to welcome him with a &ldquo;<i>Good</i>
    morning Mister Van Gort.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mendes,&rdquo; Vincent used to say, &ldquo;however
    much that aunt of yours may mutilate my name, she is a good
    soul, and I like her very much.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As I was not so very busy in those days, he often stayed
    talking for a while after the lesson, and naturally we often
    discussed his former profession, the art dealing business. He
    had kept quite a number of the prints which he had collected in
    those days, little lithographs after paintings, etc. He brought
    them to show me repeatedly, but they were always completely
    spoiled: the white borders were literally covered with
    quotations from Thomas a Kempis and the Bible, more or less
    connected with the subject, which he had scrawled all over
    them. Once he made me a present of <i>De Imitatione
    Christi,</i> without any intention of converting me, only to
    acquaint me with the deep humanity of it.</p>

    <p>In no way could I guess in those days - no more than anyone
    else, himself included - that in the depths of his soul lay
    dormant the future visionary of colour.</p>

    <p>I remember only the following incident. Proud of the fact
    that I could do it with the money I had earned myself, I had
    exchanged my Smyrna carpet, at least fifty years old and nearly
    threadbare, which had covered the floor of my room, for a very
    modest but brightly coloured cowhair one. &ldquo;Mendes!&rdquo;
    Vincent said when he saw it, &ldquo;I hadn't expected this of
    you! Do you really think this finer than those old faded
    colours which had so much in them?&rdquo; And Mendes was
    ashamed of himself, for he felt that this queer boy was
    right.</p>

    <p>Our intercourse lasted for less than a year. By then I had
    come to the conclusion that he would never be able to pass the
    required examination; so what Mrs. Du Quesne tells us, namely
    that he had mastered Latin and Greek within a few months, is
    incorrect, as well as the statement that Vincent stopped at the
    very moment he was to start on his academic course proper. No,
    at least a year before he could have reached this point, even
    with the utmost exertion on his part, I advised his uncle,
    wholly in conformity with Vincent's own wishes, to let him
    stop. And so it happened.</p>

    <p>After our cordial leave-taking before he went to the
    Borinage, I never saw him again. From there one letter from him
    to me, and an answer from me to him, and...after that,
    nothing...</p>
