  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Your letter and its contents, literary as well as financial,
    were very welcome, and I thank you warmly for it. In the first
    place, I was especially glad to hear that perhaps it will not
    be so very long before you come to Holland again. I should like
    very much to know as soon as it is possible for you to decide
    whether it will be before or after New Year's. Am very glad
    that you sent off the studies. These days, when I am making
    many new ones, I feel so strongly that I must try to keep my
    studies after the model together. How delightful it would be if
    I could consult with you about the work more, but we are too
    far away from each other.</p>

    <p>Recently I saw, and I also have it in my collection, a large
    wood engraving after a picture by Roll, &ldquo;Une Gr&egrave;ve
    de Charbonniers&rdquo; [Miners' Strike]. Perhaps you know that
    painter, and if so, what have you seen of his work? This one
    represents the entrance to a mine, before which there are
    groups of men and women and children who have evidently stormed
    the building. They are standing or sitting around an overturned
    cart, and are kept in order by mounted police. One fellow is
    about to throw a stone, but a woman is trying to seize his arm.
    The characters are excellent, and it is drawn roughly and
    vigorously; I am certainly sure it is painted quite in
    accordance with the nature of the subject. It is not like Knaus
    or Vautier, but done with more passion, as it were - hardly any
    details, everything massed and simplified - but there is much
    style in it. There is such expression and atmosphere and
    feeling, and the movements of the figures - the different
    actions - are masterfully expressed. I was greatly impressed by
    it, so was Rappard, to whom I also sent one. It was in
    <i>L'Illustration,</i> but in an old number.</p>

    <p>By chance I have another one by an English draughtsman,
    Emslie, whose subject is men going down into a mine to assist,
    if possible, the injured, while women stand waiting. One seldom
    comes across such subjects.</p>

    <p>As to the one by Roll, I myself was once present at such a
    scene, complete in every detail, and I think the beauty of his
    picture is that it expresses such a situation so accurately,
    though one finds but very few of the details in it. I thought
    of a saying by Corot, &ldquo;Il y a des tableaux o&ugrave; il
    n'y a rien et <i>pourtant tout y est.&rdquo;</i> [There are
    pictures in which there is nothing and yet <i>everything is in
    them.</i>] There is something grand and classic in the whole,
    in the composition and in the lines, in a beautiful historical
    painting; and that is a quality which is as rare nowadays it
    always has been and always will be. It reminds me a little of
    G&eacute;ricault, namely, &ldquo;Le Radeau de la
    M&eacute;duse&rdquo; [The Raft of The Medusa], and at the same
    time of Numkaczy, for instance.</p>

    <p>This week I have drawn a few heads and also some children's
    figures and a few old men from the almshouse.</p>

    <p>I agree with you in what you say about those small drawings,
    namely that the one of the little bench is done in more of an
    old-fashioned manner. But - I did it more or less on purpose,
    and will perhaps do it again sometime. However greatly I may
    admire many pictures and drawings that are made especially with
    a view to the delicate grey harmonious colour, and the local
    tone, yet I believe that many artists, who aimed less at this,
    and are called old-fashioned now, will always remain green and
    fresh because their manner <i>had, and will keep</i>, its own
    raison d'&ecirc;tre.</p>

    <p>To tell you the truth, I couldn't spare either the old- or
    the new-fashioned manner. Too many beautiful things have been
    done too unusually well for me to prefer one to the other
    systematically. And the changes which the moderns have made in
    art are not always for the better; not everything means
    progress - neither in the works nor in the artists themselves -
    and often it seems to me that many lose sight of the origin and
    the goal, or in other words, they do not stick to the
    point.</p>

    <p>Your description of that night effect again struck me as
    very beautiful. It looks very different here today, but
    beautiful in its own way, for instance, the grounds near the
    Rhine railway station: in the foreground, the cinder path with
    the poplars, which are beginning to lose their leaves; then the
    ditch full of duckweed, with a high bank covered with faded
    grass and rushes; then the grey or brown-gray soil of spaded
    potato fields, or plots planted with greenish purple-red
    cabbage, here and there the very fresh green of newly sprouted
    autumn weeds above which rise bean stalks with faded stems and
    the reddish or green or black bean pods; behind this stretch of
    ground, the red-rusted or black rails in yellow sand; here and
    there stacks of old timber - heaps of coal - discarded railway
    carriages; higher up to the right, a few roofs and the freight
    depot - to the left a far-reaching view of the damp green
    meadows, shut off far away at the horizon by a greyish streak,
    in which one can still distinguish trees, red roofs and black
    factory chimneys. Above it, a somewhat yellowish yet grey sky,
    very chilly and wintry, hanging low; there are occasional
    bursts of rain, and many hungry crows are flying around. Still,
    a great deal of light falls on everything; It shows even more
    when a few little figures in blue or white smocks move over the
    ground, so that shoulders and heads catch the light.</p>

    <p>I think, however, that in Paris everything probably looks
    much cleaner and less chilly. For the chilliness even
    penetrates the house, and when one lights a pipe, it seems damp
    from the drizzling rain. But it is very beautiful.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.loneliness">But it's on days like
    this that one would like to go and see
    some friend or would like a friend to come to the house; and
    it's on days like this that one has an empty feeling when one
    can go nowhere and nobody comes. But it's then that I feel how
    much the work means to me, how it gives tone to life, apart
    from approval or disapproval; and on days which would otherwise
    make one melancholy, one is glad to have a will.</label></p>

    <p>I had a model for a few hours today, <art id=986>a boy with a spade,
    hod-carrier by trade</art>, a very intriguing type - flat nose, thick
    lips and very coarse, straight hair - yet whenever he does
    something, there is grace in the figure, at least style and
    -character. I think I shall have some good
    models this winter; the owner of the yard has promised to send
    me the ones who come to ask for work, which often happens in
    the slack season. I am always glad to give them a few sixpences
    for an afternoon or morning, for that is just what I want. I
    see no other way than to work from the model. Of course one
    must not extinguish one's power of imagination, but the
    imagination is made sharper and more correct by continually
    studying nature and wrestling with it. Next Sunday I hope to
    have the same boy again. Then I should like to draw him as if
    he were towing one of the boats filled with stones, which one
    often sees in the canal here.</p>

    <p>Working out-of-doors is over now - I mean, sitting quietly,
    for it is getting too chilly - so we shall have to take up our
    winter quarters.</p>

    <p>I look forward to the winter with pleasure; it is a
    delightful season, when one can work regularly. I have some
    hope I shall get on well. I need not tell you that I sincerely
    hope you will get back the money in question. As you know, I
    carried painting and watercolours further than I originally
    intended, and now I have to pay for it by being hard up. But we
    shall get over that, and it must not be a reason for slacking
    off. I now vary my work by drawing a great deal from the model,
    though that is also rather expensive, but it fills my
    portfolios in proportion to its emptying my purse.</p>

    <p>If you do not have the whole sum by the twentieth of the
    month, send me part of it; but I would rather receive it a day
    sooner than later, as I have to pay the week's rent on that
    day.</p>

    <p>The house continues to please me, except that one wall is
    very damp. I can work here with a model much better than at the
    other studio. I can even work with several people at the same
    time, for instance, two children under an umbrella,<art id=988> two women
    standing</art> talking, <art id=991>a man and woman arm-in-arm</art>, etc.</p>

    <p>But how short a spring and summer we have really had.
    Sometimes it seems to me as if there had been nothing between
    last autumn and this one, but perhaps it is because of my
    illness lying between. <label content="health.fatigue">I feel quite normal now, except when I
    am very tired; then I sometimes have a day or half a day when I
    feel indescribably weak and faint, much more so now than
    before. However, I do not pay attention to it any more, for I'm
    getting sick of it, and I can't afford to be ill, as I have too
    much work to do. At such times taking a long walk to
    Scheveningen or somewhere often helps me.</label></p>

    <p><label content="art.material">Well, be sure to write by the twentieth, I have had to buy
    some Whatman paper and brushes. You cannot believe how many
    things one sometimes needs.</label> Well, it's the same with every
    painter.</p>

    <p>A handshake in thought, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
