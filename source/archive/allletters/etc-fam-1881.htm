    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>14 February 1881</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">It seems as if the melancholy mood caused by our worries
    about Vincent has much diminished since we heard that good news
    about your promotion&hellip;</label>It is very kind of you that you are
    willing to assist us a little in those expenses for Vincent. I
    can assure you that it will not be a negligible relief to us,
    for the months fly by and every time the necessary sum has to
    be available. I sent him forty guilders in the beginning of
    January, twenty guilders on 22 January, thirty-five guilders on
    7 February. Yet, it should not get you into any troubles
    yourself. For the moment he is cared for, but in the beginning
    of March he will need something again. Does it suit you to take
    care of it already then, or shall I do it; tell me frankly.</p>
