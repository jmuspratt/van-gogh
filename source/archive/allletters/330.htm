  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>This time I am writing to you from the remotest corner of
    Drenthe, where I have arrived after an endless passage by barge
    through the heathland.</p>

    <p>I don't think I shall be able to do justice to the
    countryside because words fail me, but imagine the banks of the
    canal as miles and miles of, say, Michels or Th. Rousseaus, Van
    Goyens or Ph. de Konincks.</p>

    <p>Level planes or strips, varied in colour, that grow narrower
    and narrower as they approach the horizon. Accentuated here and
    there by a turf hut or small farmhouse or a few stunted
    beeches, poplars, oaks - peat stacked up everywhere and barges
    constantly passing by with peat or bulrushes from the marshes.
    Here and there skinny cows, subtle in colour, quite often sheep
    and pigs.</p>

    <p>In general the figures that now and then put in an
    appearance on the flats are full of character; and sometimes
    they have an exquisite charm. I drew, amongst others, a little
    woman on the barge, wearing crape round her casque brooches
    because she was in mourning, and then a mother with a baby -
    the latter had a purple shawl over its head. [The headdress is
    a kind of golden casque worn by Frisian women. It consists of
    two oval plates with ornamental spirals at the temples. Over
    these plates is worn a cap of stiff lace with wide frills.
    Often this (costly) headgear is very becoming.] There are lots
    of Ostade types among them, physiognomies that put one in mind
    of pigs or crows, but now and then a little figure who is like
    a lily among the thorns.</p>

    <p>In short, I am very pleased with this trip, for I am full of
    what I have seen.</p>

    <p>This evening the heath was inexpressibly lovely. There is a
    Daubigny in one of the Boetzel Albums which conveys the effect
    precisely. The sky was of an inexpressibly delicate lilac-white
    - the clouds not fleecy, for they were joined together more,
    but in tufts covering the whole sky in tones of more or less
    lilac-grey-white, with a single small break through which the
    blue gleamed. Then, at the horizon, a glorious red streak, the
    surprisingly dark stretch of brown heath underneath and a host
    of little low-roofed huts against the brilliant red streak.</p>

    <p>In the evening this heath often has the kind of effect the
    English call &ldquo;weird&rdquo; and &ldquo;quaint.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The fantastic silhouettes of Don Quixote-like mills or
    curious monsters of drawbridges are profiled against the
    vibrant evening sky. Such villages look wonderfully cosy in the
    evening sometimes, with the reflections of little lighted
    windows in the water, or in the mud and puddles.</p>

    <p>Before I started out from Hoogeveen, I painted a few studies
    there, among others <art id=0017>a large moss-roofed farm</art>.
    For I had had paint sent from Furn&eacute;e, <label content="psychology.depression">as I thought on
    the subject like you wrote in your letter, that by absorbing
    myself in my work, and quite losing myself in it, my mood would
    change, and it has already greatly improved.</label></p>

    <p>But at times - like those moments when you think of going to
    America - I think of enlisting for the East Indies; but those
    are miserable, gloomy moments, when one is overwhelmed by
    things, and I could wish you might see those silent moors,
    which I see here from the window, for such a thing calms one
    down, and inspires one to more faith, resignation,
    steady work. In the barge I drew several studies, but I stayed
    a while here to paint some. I am quite near Zweeloo, where,
    among others, Liebermann has been; and besides, there is a part
    here where you still find large, very old turf huts, that have
    not even a partition between the stable and the living room. I
    intend first of all to visit that part one of these days.</p>

    <p>But what tranquillity, what expanse, what calmness in this
    landscape; one feels it only when there are miles and miles of
    Michels between oneself and the ordinary world. I cannot give
    you a permanent address as yet, as I do not exactly know where
    I shall be for the next few days, but by 12th October <i>I
    shall be at Hoogeveen</i>, and if you send your letter
    at the usual time <i>to the same address</i>, I shall find it
    there, on the 12th, at Hoogeveen.</p>

    <p>The place where I am now is Nieuw Amsterdam.</p>

    <p>Father sent me a postal order for ten guilders, which,
    together with the money from you, makes me able to paint a
    little now.</p>

    <p>I intend to settle for a long time at the inn where I am
    now, if I can easily reach from there that district with the
    large old turf huts, as I should have better light and more
    space there. As to that picture you mention, by that
    Englishman, with the lean cat and the small coffin, though he
    got his first inspiration in that dark room, he would hardly
    have been able to paint it in that same spot, <label content="art.technique">for if one works
    in too dark a room, the work usually becomes too light, so that
    when one brings it out to the light, all the shadows are too
    weak. I just had that experience when I painted from the barn
    an open door and a glimpse into the little garden.</label></p>

    <p>Well, what I wanted to say is that there will be a chance to
    remove that obstacle too, for here I can get a room with good
    light, which can be heated in winter. Well, lad, if you do not
    think any more about America, nor I of Harderwijk [The place
    where Volunteers for the East Indian army enlisted] I hope
    things will work themselves out, I admit your explanation of C.
    M.'s silence may be right, but sometimes one can be careless
    purposely. On the back of the page you will find a few
    scratches. I write in haste, it is already late.</p>

    <p>How I wish we could walk here together, and paint together.
    I think the country would charm and convince you. Adieu, I hope
    you are well and are having some luck. During this excursion I
    have thought of you continually. With a handshake,</p>

     Yours, Vincent</p>
