  <body>
    <p>Thursday evening</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and the enclosed. I was in Etten
    again when I received it; as I told you, I had arranged this
    with Mauve. But now you see I am back again in The Hague. On
    Christmas Day I had a violent scene with Father, and it went so
    far that Father told me I had better leave the house. Well, he
    said it so decidedly that I actually left the same day.</p>

    <p>The real reason was that I did not go to church, and also
    that if going to church was compulsory and if I was
    <i>forced</i> to go, I certainly should never go again out of
    courtesy, as I had done rather regularly all the time I was in
    Etten. But oh, in truth there was much more at the back of it
    all, including the whole story of what happened this summer
    between Kee and me.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.clergy">I do not remember ever having been in such a rage in my
    life. I frankly said that I thought their whole system of
    religion horrible, and just because I had gone too deeply into
    those questions during a miserable period in my life, I did not
    want to think of them any more, and must keep clear of them as
    of something fatal.</label></p>

    <p>Was I <i>too</i> angry, <i>too</i> violent? Maybe - but even
    so, it is settled now, once and for all.</p>

    <p>I went back to Mauve and said, &ldquo;Listen, Mauve, I
    cannot stay in Etten any longer, and I must go and live
    somewhere else, preferably here.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, Mauve said, &ldquo;Then stay.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And so I have rented a studio here, that is, a room and an
    alcove which can be arranged for the purpose, cheap enough, on
    the outskirts of the town, in Schenkweg, ten minutes from
    Mauve. Father said if I wanted money, he would lend it to me if
    necessary, but this is impossible now, I must be quite
    independent of Father. How? I do not know yet, but Mauve will
    help me if necessary, and I hope and believe you will too, and
    of course I will work and try as hard as I can to earn
    something.</p>

    <p>I am in for it now, and the die is cast. At an inconvenient
    moment, but how can it be helped?</p>

    <p>I must have some simple furniture, and besides, all my
    expenses for drawing and painting materials will increase.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">I must also try to dress somewhat better.</label></p>

    <p>It is a risky affair, a question of sink or swim. But
    someday I should have had to set myself up, so what shall I
    say? It has happened sooner than I expected.<label content="attitude.father"> As to the relation
    between Father and me, that will not be redressed so very
    easily. The difference in our views and opinions is too great.</label>
    It will be a hard pull for me; the tide rises high, almost to
    the lips, and perhaps higher still - how can I know? But I will
    fight my battle, and sell my life dearly, and try to win and
    get the best of it.</p>

    <p>January 1 I shall move into the new studio. I will take the
    simplest furniture, a wooden table and a few chairs. I would be
    satisfied with a blanket on the floor instead of a bed. But
    Mauve wants me to get a bed, and will lend me the money if
    necessary.</p>

    <p>As you can imagine, I have a great many cares and worries.
    But still it gives me a feeling of satisfaction to have gone
    <i>so</i> far that I cannot go back again; and though the path
    may be difficult, I now see it clearly before me.</p>

    <p>Of course I must ask you, Theo, if you will occasionally
    send me what you can spare without inconveniencing yourself.
    And send it to me rather than give it to others, for if it is
    possible, we must not get Mauve mixed up in the financial
    affairs. His helping me with advice in art matters is already
    of such enormous value. But he insists on my buying, for
    instance, a bed and a few pieces of furniture. He says, I will
    lend you the money if necessary. And according to him I must
    dress somewhat better and not try to skimp too much.</p>

    <p>I will soon write you at greater length. I <i>will not
    consider it a misfortune</i> that things have gone so far; on
    the contrary, notwithstanding all kinds of emotions, I feel a
    certain calm. There is safety in the midst of danger. What
    would life be if we hadn't courage to attempt anything?</p>

    <p>I have been walking around everywhere to find that studio,
    in town as well as in Scheveningen. Scheveningen is terribly
    expensive. This studio costs only 7 guilders a month - it's the
    furniture that makes it so expensive. But once one has a house
    of one's own, it is a good possession and gives one a more
    solid footing. The light comes from the south, but the window
    is large and high, and I think the room will look very pleasant
    after a while. You can imagine that I feel quite animated. How
    will my work be a year from now? If I could only express what I
    feel! Well, Mauve understands all this, and he will give me as
    much technical advice as he can - the things which fill my head
    and my heart must be expressed in drawings or pictures.</p>

    <p>Mauve himself is very busy with a large picture of a fishing
    smack drawn as far as the dunes by horses.</p>

    <p>I think it delightful to be in The Hague, and I find so many
    beautiful things here, I must try to express something of it.
    Adieu, boy, a handshake in thought and write soon, believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Kind regards from Mauve and Jet.</p>

    <p>I have a little money left, but how long will it last? I
    must stay at the inn until January 1. Address your letters, A.
    Mauve, Uileboomen 198. I go there almost every day.</p>
