    <p>[The envelope of this letter is addressed to: Furn&eacute;e,
    Korte Poten, The Hague, and bears the postmark: Nuenen, 3
    August 1885.]</p>

    <p>Dear Mr. Furn&eacute;e, <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>In reply to your postcard I want to submit a few things to
    you for your consideration.</p>

    <p>I wrote you that after my father's death I had taken a house
    of my own here, and I requested you to have patience, as I
    should soon be able to send you the money.</p>

    <p>But look here, perhaps you know that until now I have
    received financial help from my brother, who is an art dealer
    in Paris. I am making progress with my work, and the chances of
    selling are better than they used to be; but at the same time
    this is the very moment when financial assistance from others
    has been completely discontinued, and I am exclusively
    dependent on my own work. My father's decease as well as my
    wish to be quite on my own are two changes that for the time
    being make me even poorer than I was before.</p>

    <p>And look here - suppose you draw a bill of exchange on me,
    well, I <i>cannot</i> pay cash; if I have it, it will be 10
    guilders one time and 5 guilders another, and to earn these I
    shall have to pay for canvas, colours, brushes again. So if you
    should demand payment, you would have to resort to extreme
    measures (if you should insist on ready money), i.e. selling my
    furniture and my other possessions. These consist of a small
    number of old chairs and a plain wooden worktable, and the long
    and short of it is that they are of so little value that the
    whole lot together, in a village like the one I live in, would
    not bring 10 guilders.</p>

    <p>So what will you gain by doing this? If you really want to,
    I should not much care, but it would most decidedly not bee the
    way to get your money; but if you will wait, I will pay you in
    full.</p>

    <p>If you should draw your bill and take these tremendous
    measures - well, it would be to my advantage.</p>

    <p><i>I have only one thing</i>, and that is steadily
    improving: I mean my pictures and my drawings.</p>

    <p>What I hear people say about them is good as well as bad,
    and they can all think whatever they like of them. But as for
    the present case - seeing that they represent my only means of
    paying you, what do you want?</p>

    <p>Will you wait until I sell something and settle my account?
    <i>All right</i> - I am not dishonest, and I <i>shall</i> pay
    you as soon as I have the money.</p>

    <p>Do you want me to send you some of my work, so that you will
    be able to show it to art lovers?</p>

    <p>There is nothing I should like better.</p>

    <p>I have inherited - not a single cent.</p>

    <p>In the first place my father was not rich, and in the second
    place not one of the children has claimed his or her portion of
    the inheritance.</p>

    <p>I don't think you will be the loser if you try to achieve
    some success with my paintings. I am willing to send you a
    number of them, and perhaps they will not disappoint you. It
    might mean that I should not only be able to pay you, but also
    to buy even more colours.</p>

    <p>At present I need colours quite as much as money.</p>

    <p>As I am <i>very much afraid of being in debt</i>, I do not
    run up high bills, I buy very little and only cash down, and I
    use only the colours I get brayed here.</p>

    <p>If I am forced to let you wait, it is because I have to wait
    even worse myself.</p>

    <p>As for drawing a bill of exchange, I tell you emphatically
    that I do not appeal to your clemency, that you would, however,
    have to take extreme measures, and I add that it would be to my
    advantage, as I possess literally nothing but my tools. Please
    answer this letter in any case, for you should know that if you
    draw a bill, you will <i>not</i> gain your object, and that
    later on I shall certainly not pay you, seeing that in that
    case you will have lost your rights. But <i>you will be
    paid</i>, either if on your part you are willing to try and
    dispose of some of my work for me, or if you will wait until I
    sell something of what I have on hand here.</p>

    <p>I offer you my apologies for all this, but the circumstances
    I related are my excuse. However, I am not doing so badly, and
    <i>above all things you should not despair of getting your
    money</i>; it will be all right, but I myself have to wait
    worse and longer than you.</p>

    <p>With regards,</p>

    <p>Yours obediently, Vincent van Gogh</p>

    <p>One last word.</p>

    <p>If I were dishonest, certainly no moment could be more
    opportune than the present to get rid of a few small debts by
    letting you draw your bill of exchange, and then passively
    awaiting developments. But I need not be disturbed by the
    comparatively small amount I have to pay. I work too hard to
    believe that I work in vain. If I said to you and Leurs, to
    whom I owe another 25 guilders, go ahead with your bills,
    <i>you</i>, and not <i>I</i>, would be the losers.</p>

    <p>Please note once and for all that I am not exactly afraid of
    bills of exchange. I buy nearly everything cash down and I
    regulate my requirements so much in accordance with my ready
    money that now and then weeks pass without my spending a single
    guilder except on bread.<label content="business.sales"> Last year I had an ugly setback in the
    matter of the decoration of a dining room, which I did for
    somebody who would not pay me. </label>If you take into consideration
    that notwithstanding all my exertions I have not yet recovered
    from the deficit thus occasioned - the colours I got from you
    and Leurs last year were destined for that purpose - you will
    understand that the year was not lucrative for me. I have no
    friends - and yet I tell you, do not despair of getting your
    money!</p>

    <p>But could you manage to show some of my work at The Hague?
    That would be the best thing, and in this way you would serve
    your own interests as well as mine. I don't ask high prices,
    and the amount in question is not big. And therefore I suggest
    you try it. I haven't any money, less than ever before, as this
    is a period in which I am making myself independent of all
    subsidies. <sup>2</sup></p>
