    <p>[The first and last part of this letter are missing;
    probably it was the answer to the remittance of January
    20.]</p>

    <p>You will say that I write pretty often. I can't help it, for
    as you have taken me into your confidence, I must tell you that
    it touched me very deeply. It is curious in such cases, that it
    is so very difficult to know how far one must go. You, too,
    will experience this. <label content="Theo.mistress">One asks oneself, &ldquo;Must I help this
    woman and, for the rest, see her only as a friend, or must I
    choose this woman for my wife, with whom I want to live forever
    - is she or isn't she the one?&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>I think you have not been without this struggle, and perhaps
    are still in the midst of it. It would seem rather unnatural to
    me if it were otherwise.</p>

    <p>I, at least, had that struggle, and it was so difficult that
    for myself I <i>could</i> not answer those questions when
    circumstances forced me to make a decision.</p>

    <p>For I thought, I do not have the means to maintain two
    separate households, but perhaps I have them for <i>one</i>,
    and so I must tell her how things are, what I might be able to
    do and what I certainly could not do. Perhaps we'll be able to
    struggle through together, but I haven't enough unless we live
    together. Perhaps the struggle is similar for you, but in a
    different form. I remember a saying of yours last year which I
    thought very correct and true, &ldquo;Marriage is such a queer
    thing.&rdquo; Yes, indeed, it certainly is. Then you said to
    me, &ldquo;Do not marry her,&rdquo; and I admitted then that
    circumstances were such that it was better not to talk about it
    for the time being. And you know that since then I have not
    mentioned it again, but she and I have remained true to each
    other. And just because I cannot think you were wrong in saying
    then, &ldquo;Do not marry her,&rdquo; I give you your own words
    to consider; and besides, you will think of it yourself, for it
    is not I who say so, but you yourself. And I remind you of it
    only because I think it was well it didn't take place at once.
    Don't let that idea go, for it is a good thing for love to
    ripen, so that marriage becomes subordinate to it. It is safer
    and it doesn't hurt anybody.</p>

    <p>First of all, I want to tell you one thing which will be
    perfectly obvious to you. Whether it gets you in trouble or
    not, I respect the noble feeling which prompted you to help
    her, and because I respect it, I hope you will think me worthy
    of your confidence even though you may encounter greater or
    lesser difficulties.</p>

    <p>However, I do not take a melancholy view of the matter, but
    am quite hopeful of a good result - that is, happiness for you
    and for her. But I repeat - it is probable that sooner or later
    a crisis will occur, arising from a kind of mutual
    disappointment - if there were a child, it would be a kind of
    lightning rod for you both. But in your case there isn't, so
    especially when the crisis comes - not <i>now</i>, but
    <i>later</i> - confide in me and consult me; for there are
    cliffs on which, alas, many a love is wrecked which might have
    been saved. When one has got past those rocks, a period of
    clear sailing follows.</p>

    <p>Though I have written you often, I am very hard at work. I
    cannot tell you how I long to speak with you about many things.
    Tomorrow I get a sou'wester for the heads. Heads of fishermen,
    old and young, that's what I have been thinking of for a long
    time, and I have made one already, then afterward I couldn't
    get a sou'wester. Now I shall have one of my own, an old one
    over which many storms and seas have passed.</p>
