  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I must tell you that Rappard has been here, and that I
    borrowed 25 guilders from him, promising to pay them back next
    autumn. I was very glad to see him - he came in the morning and
    stayed till the last train in the evening, and we spent the
    whole day looking at the studies, and drawings, and he also
    made a sketch in printer's ink and turpentine, just to see what
    it was like. Now I am going to him tomorrow, to see his work
    and his studio. It was a thoroughly pleasant day. He was rather
    changed both in appearance and in manner. I personally like him
    much better now than before. He has become broader in the
    shoulders, and I think broader in his views on many things
    too.</p>

    <p>Well, the money he advanced me has helped me to get many
    things which I absolutely needed.</p>

    <p>Among other things,<label content="art.support"> I ordered large sketching blocks for
    working out-of-doors.</label> And I had to buy a pair of trousers, and
    tomorrow I shall have to pay the fare to Utrecht. But it has
    helped me a great deal.</p>

    <p>I was also surprised by a very short visit from Father. I
    think he rather liked the workmen's figures I am working
    on.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">Among the blocks I ordered with Rappard's money is also one
    for watercolours;</label> I tried it at once, a cottage in the dunes
    with a wheelbarrow, etc., in the foreground, and a small figure
    of a digger in the background. Oh, Theo, some day or other I
    shall surely get the knack of making watercolours.</p>

    <p>These last days, or rather weeks, I have had the very
    pleasant company of a young land surveyor who tried his hand at
    drawing [Furn&eacute;e]. He once showed me drawings, which I
    thought very bad, and I told him why I thought them so bad.</p>

    <p>Of course I never expected to hear from him again after
    that; but one day he returned - he has more leisure now, might
    he come with me to work outdoors? Well, Theo, the fellow has
    got the knack of landscape drawing so well that at present he
    brings home really charming sketches of meadow, wood and dune.
    But he still has to pass an examination in October, and his
    father does not want him to spend so much time on drawing. But
    in my opinion he can very well combine his profession of land
    surveyor with drawing.</p>

    <p>He is the kind of fellow Rappard was when we first knew
    him.</p>

    <p>The things he made before I knew him were horrible daubs,
    most of them hideous. I began by telling him that at first he
    had to confine himself to drawing for some time. I made him
    draw many things which he did not like at all, but he trusted
    me in this. Now this morning he asked me if he couldn't try his
    hand at painting again, and <i>now</i> it came off very well,
    and he has scraped off all his old things.</p>

    <p>I am longing for a letter from you; Rappard sends you his
    best regards.</p>

    <p>Are you well, and how is your patient doing? Father told me
    you had written something about coming this summer. I can
    hardly tell you how much I long for it.</p>

    <p>In the Salon's illustrated catalogue I saw &ldquo;La
    Moisson&rdquo; [Harvest] by Lhermitte. That looks good. How
    thoroughly it expresses the action of the peasant figure!</p>

    <p>Well, adieu, I hope your letter will arrive soon, for I have
    gone through my money again. I saw Arnold in town with somebody
    else, perhaps Trip <sup>1</sup>, they were walking with Mauve,
    but I saw them only from a distance. As Mauve was in the
    middle, it reminded me of &ldquo;Le Christ Entre Deux
    Larrons&rdquo; [Christ between Two Thieves], or the group
    silhouetted against a sunny wall made me think of somebody
    arrested by two policemen.</p>

    <p>However, these are merely imaginings, &ldquo;things as they
    might be seen.&rdquo; Good luck, boy. A handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
