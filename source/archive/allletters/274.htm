  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter of the 9th of March, and for the
    enclosed.<label content="Theo.mistress"> Is your patient improving? I hope in this case
    &ldquo;no news is good news.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If it has been as cold in Paris as it was here last week, it
    cannot have agreed very well with her.</label></p>

    <p>When you say that you sometimes wish we could talk together
    more, about a variety of things in art, I for my part have that
    longing continually, and sometimes very strongly.</p>

    <p>So often I should like to know your opinion about this or
    that, about some studies, etc., for instance, if they might be
    of some use, or if it would be advisable, for some reason or
    other, to go more deeply into them.</p>

    <p>So often I should like to have some more information about
    things on which you are better informed than I, and I should
    like to know more about the state of things, I mean what kind
    of work the painters are producing. One can write about it to
    some extent, but writing takes time, and one cannot always get
    to it, nor can one go enough into detail.</p>

    <p>And just now, owing to a piling up of studies, it would be
    worth a great deal to me if we could talk things over together,
    and I should also like so much to have you see how the studio
    is improved.</p>

    <p>Well, let us hope that it will not be so very, very long
    before you come to Holland.</p>

    <p>Be clear in your mind, dear brother, how strongly and
    intensely I feel the enormous debt I owe you for your faithful
    help.</p>

    <p>It would be difficult for me to express all my thoughts
    about it. It constantly remains a source of disappointment to
    me that my drawings are not yet what I want them to be. The
    difficulties are indeed numerous and great, and cannot be
    overcome at once. To make progress is a kind of miner's work;
    it doesn't advance as quickly as one would like, and as others
    also expect, but as one stands before such a task, the basic
    necessities are patience and faithfulness. In fact, I do not
    think much about the difficulties, because if one thought of
    them too much one would get stunned or disturbed.</p>

    <p>A weaver who has to direct and to interweave a great many
    little threads has no time to philosophize about it, but rather
    he is so absorbed in his work that he doesn't think but acts,
    and he <i>feels</i> how things must go more than he can explain
    it. Even though neither you nor I, in talking together, would
    come to any definite plans, etc., perhaps we might mutually
    strengthen that <i>feeling</i> that something is ripening
    within us. And that is what I should like.</p>

    <p>This morning I was at Van der Weele's, who was working at a
    marvellous picture of diggers, horses, and sand wagons, large
    size. It was beautiful in tone and colour, a grey morning haze,
    it was virile in drawing and composition, there was style and
    character in it - in fact it was by far the most beautiful and
    strongest thing of his I have ever seen. He had also painted
    three very beautiful serious studies of an old white horse, and
    also a beautiful little landscape in the dunes.</p>

    <p>This week he will probably look in at my studio, which I
    should like very much indeed.</p>

    <p>Last week I met Breitner in the street; his position in
    Rotterdam frees him from much anxiety; however, Van der Weele
    had a little note from him just this morning, to the effect
    that he was ill again. To tell you the truth, the impression I
    had when I saw him again was not very assuring; he had an air
    of disappointment, and he spoke in rather a queer way about his
    work.</p>

    <p>Now I still have to tell you about the surprise I have had.
    I received a letter from Father, very cordial and cheerful, it
    seemed to me, with twenty-five guilders enclosed. Father wrote
    he had received some money, on which he had no longer counted,
    and he wanted me to share in it. Wasn't that nice of him,
    however it quite embarrasses me.</p>

    <p>But, involuntarily, a thought occurred to me. Can it he,
    perhaps, that Father has heard, from someone or other, that I
    was very hard up? I hope that this was not his motive, for I
    think this idea of my circumstances would not be correct. And
    it might give Father anxieties which would be quite out of
    place. You will understand my meaning better than Father would
    if I were to try to explain it to him.</p>

    <p>In my opinion, I am often <i>rich as
    Cr&oelig;sus</i>, not in money, but (though it doesn't
    happen every day) rich, because I have found in my work
    something to which I can devote myself heart and soul, and
    which gives inspiration and significance to life.</p>

    <p>Of course my moods vary, but there is an average of
    serenity. I have a sure <i>faith</i> in art, a sure confidence
    that it is a powerful stream, which hears a man to harbour,
    though he himself must do his bit too; and at all events I
    think it such a great blessing, when a man has found his work,
    that I cannot count myself among the unfortunate. I mean, I may
    be in certain relatively great difficulties, and there may be
    gloomy days in my life, but I shouldn't want to be counted
    among the unfortunate nor would it be correct.</p>

    <p>You write in your letter something which I sometimes <i>feel
    also</i>: &ldquo;Sometimes I do not know how I shall pull
    through.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Look here, I often feel the same in <i>more than one
    respect</i>, not only in <i>financial</i> things, but in
    art itself, and in <i>life</i> in general. But do you think
    that something exceptional? Don't you think every man with a
    little pluck and energy has those moments?</p>

    <p>Moments of melancholy, of distress, of anguish, I think we
    all have them, more or less, and it is a condition of every
    <i>conscious</i> human life. It seems that some people have no
    self-consciousness. But those who have it, they may sometimes
    be in distress, but for all that they are not unhappy, nor is
    it something exceptional that happens to them.</p>

    <p>And sometimes there comes relief, sometimes there comes new
    inner energy, and one rises up from it, till at last, some day,
    one perhaps doesn't rise up any more, <i>que soit</i>,
    but that is nothing extraordinary, and I repeat, <i>such is the
    common human fate, in my opinion</i>.</p>

    <p>Father's letter was an answer to a letter of mine, which I
    remember quite well was very cheerful, for I told him about the
    changes in the studio, and I did not write anything to Father
    that could give rise to thoughts of my being in any
    difficulties, either financial or otherwise. In fact, Father
    doesn't write anything about it, and his letter is very
    cheerful and cordial, but the money came so unexpectedly that
    involuntarily the thought came into my head, can it be that
    Father is worried about me? If I am mistaken in this, it would
    be very much out of place to write as if that were the
    principal impression his kindness has made upon me - the
    principal impression being that I feel very grateful for having
    received something which enables me to do several things that
    otherwise I couldn't have done. But I tell you my thoughts
    about it, because in case you should perceive that Father is
    worrying about me, you would be better able to reassure him
    than I.</p>

    <p>At the same time, you see from this that I have had a real
    stroke of luck. I intend to spend it on getting my watercolour
    things in good shape. I will pay off Leurs and will be able to
    arrange for different things in the studio, in order to make it
    even more practical.</p>

    <p>It sometimes seems to me that the prices of the various
    painting and drawing materials are terribly inflated. So that
    it thwarts many a person from painting. One of my ideals is
    that there would be more institutions like the <i>Graphic,</i>
    for instance, where people who want to work can find all the
    materials, on condition that a certain ability and energy is
    demonstrated.</p>

    <p>Like Cadart, in his day, enabled many a man to etch, who
    wouldn't have been able to etch, because of the expenses, if he
    had had to pay them from his own pocket.</p>

    <p>I am privileged above many others, but I cannot do
    everything which I might have the courage and energy to
    undertake. The expenses are so extensive, beginning with a
    model and food and housing, and ending with the different
    colours and brushes.</p>

    <p>And that is also like a weaving loom, where the different
    threads must be kept apart.</p>

    <p>But we all have to bear up against the same thing - so just
    because everyone who paints or draws has to hear it, and if
    alone would almost sink down under it, why shouldn't more
    painters join hands, to work together, like soldiers of the
    rank and file; and why, especially, are those branches of art
    which are least expensive so much despised?</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">As to the crayon, I do not know whether the one you gave me
    came from the Plaats, but I am quite sure that you gave it to
    me on your visit of last summer, or <i>perhaps when I was still
    in Etten</i>. In a drug store I found a few remnants,
    perhaps six pieces, but all in small bits. Please keep it in
    mind. When I again asked Leurs for it, he told me that Jaap
    Maris had asked him so often for it.</label></p>

    <p>I have made two sketches with it again, a cradle, and one
    more like the one I sent you already, in which I washed a great
    deal with sepia. As to what you write about <art id=1024>that sketch of
    those two figures</art>, the one above the other, it is mainly an
    effect of perspective, and also of the great difference in size
    between <art id=872>the little child</art> and <art id=1072>the woman on the
    basket</art>.</p>

    <p>What I myself dislike more than that line of the
    composition is something which, in fact, you have noticed,
    that the two figures are too much of one tone, which is partly
    the fault of the crayon, which does not express all shades, and
    one would like to strengthen it with lithographic crayon, for
    instance. But I think that the principal reason is that I do
    not always have time enough to work as elaborately as I should
    like. If one works a long time on a drawing, it is possible to
    go more into detail, to seek the different tones. But too often
    I must work in a hurry. I dare not ask too much from my models.
    If I paid them better, I should have the right to demand longer
    poses, and could make better progress.</p>

    <p>At present, I often think I get more from them than a just
    return on what I pay them in money.</p>

    <p>However, I do not mean to say that there is not a still more
    important reason, namely, that I must become more skilled than
    I am before I can be ever so slightly satisfied with myself.
    And by and by I hope to make better and more elaborate things
    in the same amount of time that I now spend on them.</p>

    <p>Well, brother, my best wishes for your patient, I long
    sometimes for another description of an aspect of Paris from
    you, and &mdash; rest assured I'll make shift as best I can,
    with what your faithful help gives me &mdash; that I try and
    try to make an even better use of it, and especially that I
    blame myself for being unable to manage to do what I want with
    it. Adieu with a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
