  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter and the enclosure, and also for
    what I still received specially for St. Nicholas.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.people">I will begin by telling you that your letter greatly amazed
    me - seeing that there have been no differences of any
    importance between Father, Mother and myself, and as to the
    Begemann ladies, they looked in on Father and Mother only the
    other day in considerable numbers - and they have done so not
    just once but many times. Whether they drop in quite as
    frequently as formerly or less frequently is something I cannot
    see has anything to do with me, nor am I interested in it.</p>

    <p>That I decidedly disapproved of their attitude, and that I
    shall go on decidedly disapproving of it, is something I told
    them <i>once</i> - and I did not mince words - <i>without
    returning to the subject</i>.</p>

    <p>But this has nothing to do with their visiting our house or
    not, which is something that concerns Father and Mother and
    themselves - and not <i>me</i>. <i>I</i> have always behaved
    courteously towards all the members of the family, and I did
    not start the trouble, but <i>they started attacking me</i>
    and, which I took more to heart, <i>Margot</i> - which is the
    reason why I have strictly refrained from coming into contact
    with them - simply because I do not feel capable of changing my
    attitude of disapproval, or of hiding it.</label> Something which you
    know yourself - I say this to clarify things, and not to cause
    you grief - I repeat, something which you know yourself; as,
    expressly to show you that I said what I said in all
    tranquillity, I sent you a short note in which I told you that
    I <i>thought</i> your opinions <i>vicious</i> (you will have to
    decide for yourself whether it <i>is</i> vicious, but <i>I
    thought and think it vicious</i>).</p>

    <p>This is my subjective conviction - in such matters I have my
    own views - as to the whys and wherefores - there are things I
    can feel rather than explain clearly to you or anybody else -
    especially if they receive neither your attention nor your
    sympathy.</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin] However, my most hearty thanks for
    the remittance, and know that if I urgently request you to send
    something extra, it is only because I want to push on until we
    separate - but in peace - and without harm to you or
    myself.</p>

    <p>I let people say and think what they like of me, more than
    you perhaps suppose, but be sure of this, when a thing turns
    out wrong, that's no reason for me to admit that I ought not to
    have begun it; on the contrary, if it fails many a time, it is
    a reason for me to try again if the very same thing is not
    possible yet, and always in the same direction, as my views are
    well considered and calculated, and in my opinion have their
    raison d'&ecirc;tre.</p>

    <p>To me personally, an important difference between
    <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> the revolution - is the change
    in social position of women and the collaboration that is
    desired between men and women, with equal rights, equal
    freedom.</p>

    <p>But I can find neither words nor the time, nor the
    inclination, to go into this more deeply. Enough, the
    conventional morals are in my opinion quite <i>wrong</i>, and I
    hope they will be <i>changed</i> and <i>renewed</i> in
    time.</p>

    <p>Now, as to what you say, probably for my special
    information, namely that you &ldquo;are suspicious&rdquo; -
    well, I won't influence this. Most certainly you have shown me
    this - and it is <i>one</i> of the &ldquo;symptoms&rdquo; that
    I told you I don't think particularly fine, nor can I
    complement you on it.</p>

    <p>But this too is a subjective opinion, if you like. So by all
    means suit yourself - be suspicious or not suspicious however
    the spirit moves you, in any case I shall try to make the best
    of the consequences for me, and for the rest I can only refer
    to what I said about being on opposite sides of the barricade.
    Do what you like according to your principles - but I shall do
    the same according to <i>mine</i> - however, let's avoid taking
    aim at each other if possible, as we are brothers. I am older
    than you, and probably I have gone through certain things
    differently, and have looked upon them differently from you.
    And of course this is my own responsibility. My being unable to
    approve of everything I see you do or hear you say is something
    quite different from wanting to induce you to accept my views.
    But the fact is, I like to play a straightforward game.</p>

    <p>And bearing in mind that it is our duty to try to avoid
    putting a spoke in each other's wheel, I shall, as I told you
    already, try more and more to find other connections, in
    Eindhoven, in Antwerp, in short wherever there is a
    possibility.</p>

    <p>But this cannot be done all at once - and as for me, I am
    trying to do it for the one and only reason that you have shown
    me far too clearly and unmistakably that I should not presume
    to suppose that you are going to take notice of me personally
    or of my work, except by way of protection. Well, this I
    utterly refuse to put up with. And seeing that you have sent me
    the money every month without a word and without any sign of
    sympathy, I have toiled on - but - but seeing more and more
    clearly that a moment might come when we should have to go our
    separate ways, instead of going the same way both together. I
    don't imagine in the least that I shall gain by it financially
    - but as soon as some dealer, however much of an inferior
    jobber he may be, is willing to give me board and lodging, even
    if it should be in the meanest garret, and a few colours, I
    shall be happy to sell - if you choose to call this selling.
    Rather than protection. Here are my cards on the table. Whether
    I shall succeed in this and when, I cannot tell precisely;
    however, I work too hard to be <i>very far</i> away from
    it.</p>

    <p>The drawback to painting is the colour bill. And it worries
    me a good deal at the moment. I paid some at once out of the 40
    guilders you sent me. Besides that, I paid the carpenter, etc.
    So that, if there remained just 100 francs for you after
    deducting what you had to pay, for me there remains not quite
    25 francs; now for the moment it is true that I don't have
    <i>to live</i> on it as you do, but I must paint with it a
    whole month, which - what with models, what with colours - is
    in fact impossible.</p>

    <p>And I have the same pleasant prospect for January too, when
    I shall have to pay for all kinds of things again. So the
    reason why I complain, and why I said that I really needed
    something extra now, not later, was that I want so dreadfully
    to go on working; if I cannot do so for financial reasons, it
    makes me very unhappy. And I haven't only myself to blame for
    it, for the very reason that my expenses are caused not by
    extravagance but by working.</p>

    <p>If you cannot accept this point of view or sympathize with
    my feelings, and choose to remain suspicious - well, old
    fellow, I am willing to believe you mean excellently well, and
    so - I am not very worried by your suspicions. Unless the fact
    is that you purposely act this way in order to get rid of me,
    and by heaven, you are well on the way to reaching this
    goal.</p>

    <p>You know that in the past I often positively begged you to
    see to it that our relations should be kept up - now I should
    not be able to urge the matter any longer in the same way. Once
    again, I work too hard to be obliged to remain in a dependent
    position for too long a time if this should degenerate too much
    into protection, whereas, when I write about it in a
    businesslike way, I don't even get an answer. No, old fellow -
    I cannot reconcile my sense of honour, my sense of justice, to
    seeing anything in it that might induce me to consider it
    permanent. Listen - Father has felt <i>suspicious</i> of me
    <i>very often</i> and <i>to a high degree</i>. For that matter,
    you know something about it, and I for my part know perhaps
    even more about it. But - for all that - he always called
    himself &ldquo;my friend&rdquo; - <i>for all that</i> - the man
    really thought he was in the right, and he was unable to take
    any other view of things, and - after all is said and done - he
    meant well, that is to say, if you want to take it that way -
    but one fine day I told him flatly: Don't call yourself my
    friend as long as you think such and such things of me. People
    who think that way about me <i>are not my friends but my
    enemies</i>, and as sure as 2 X 2 = 4, they are my worst
    enemies. And the same applies to you, in reply to what you say
    about being suspicious. With this difference (which I am
    willing to appreciate and take into account), Father did not
    mention that &ldquo;he was suspicious,&rdquo; you do mention it
    - which neutralizes a lot. But for all that, I consider it
    basically pretty much the same thing.</p>

    <p>However, I don't want to influence you - and therefore I
    tell you straight out that on my part I don't in the least
    pledge myself to agree with Father or you. Please understand
    this thoroughly - it is quite possible that there is more than
    one &ldquo;ditch&rdquo; between the two of us. And because this
    is quite possible, also understand thoroughly that I'm not
    giving you the slightest encouragement to think all kinds of
    nice and good things of me <i>according to your views or
    Father's</i>. It might well be that mine were opposed to them
    in quite a revolutionary way!</p>

    <p>Under the circumstances I cannot do crazy things at a short
    notice and stand in my own light by giving up things at a
    moment that is not propitious just because you find yourself in
    a suspicious mood. But please understand thoroughly that, if
    this suspicious mood should be lasting and prove to take root
    in your mind - even if I should not do crazy things at a short
    notice - I am strongly inclined to see to it that we can
    separate in peace, and without harm to either you or me.</p>

    <p>Separate - but in peace - and without forcing things too
    much.</p>

    <p>I cannot bother about what people think of me, what I have
    to think of is <i>getting on</i>.</p>

    <p>So I go my own way with a certain obstinacy, believing in
    some things and not believing in others.</p>

    <p>You are, and rightly so, anxious about your position, aren't
    you? - about the progress or non-success, the prospering or the
    failure of your business. Bear in mind that the reasons why I
    stand by my profession are certainly no less important than the
    ones for which you stand by yours. And without exactly
    proceeding very delicately, I must and will push on.</p>

    <p>I certainly intend to hold on to my studio here, as for
    instance Stenglin does; he has one on the moors of Drenthe,
    though at times he lives somewhere else. I have rented it as a
    kind of refuge, and it will remain useful to me as such. Taking
    rooms in Eindhoven would be downright nonsense, I cannot even
    think of it. Later on, taking a room in Antwerp, all right,
    that's my intention, but in the first place I have no money for
    it now, and in the second, I want to paint a rather large
    number of heads first, which will go more smoothly the better I
    can pay the models.</p>

    <p>But, as you say, things are not exactly favourable for
    this.</p>

    <p>I wish you could understand that I am not actuated by a
    desire to quarrel in wanting to separate - on the contrary, I
    want to separate in order to be able to keep the peace. I
    should not be able to bear it if I had no prospect of different
    circumstances. Not primarily with regard to financial matters,
    but because I want to live more pleasantly than in the house
    itself - but I don't feel at home in it, and from your own
    words it is evident that you cannot understand me, nor can I
    understand you. Therefore - with steady courage and serenity
    and without rancour: <i>I must plod on in order to separate in
    peace</i>, and without <i>harming</i> anybody.</p>

    <p>But never think I desire to quarrel with you or with the
    people at home - for this is not in character - although you
    suppose it is, and so do others, for that matter.</p>

    <p>Quite the opposite is true of my character - the fact is
    that I cannot endure life without more peace and
    cordiality.</p>

    <p>I can only shrug my shoulders at such an opinion - however,
    I most decidedly <i>do not</i> consider the persons who think
    of me this way as my friends. Though they were a thousand times
    my father or my brother - if they think that way it grieves me,
    but, fortunately for myself, I have my wits about me
    sufficiently not to be crushed by it.</p>

    <p>As to this the road is pretty clearly indicated, I should
    say.</p>
