    <p>[After Theo's visit]</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Coming home just now, the very first thing I want to do is
    to beg a favour of you - a favour which I do not doubt is
    necessary, because it will show you that my intentions are the
    same as yours - it is: do not hurry me in the various things we
    could not settle at once, for I need some time to decide.</p>

    <p>As to my relative coolness towards Father, I will explain
    that to you now that you mention it.</p>

    <p>About a year ago, father came to the Hague for the first
    time since I had left home seeking peace which I didn't find
    there, either. I was already living with the woman then, and
    said, &ldquo;Father, as I cannot blame those who disapprove of
    my conduct, given the prevailing conditions, I purposely
    avoided those whom I think would be ashamed of me. And you
    understand, I do not want to worry you, and as long as my
    affairs are not straightened out and I have not found my way,
    don't you think it would be better for me not to come
    home?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If Father had answered something like, &ldquo;No, that's
    carrying things to far,&rdquo; I would certainly have felt more
    warmly towards him; but Father's answer was something between
    Yes and No: &ldquo;Well, you must do as you think
    best.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So, presuming they will be more or less ashamed of me, which
    fits in with what you said, I was not very keen on
    correspondence - neither was Father, and neither his letters
    nor mine have been a very intimate. This &ldquo;entre
    nous,&rdquo; only to explain things, not to draw any further
    conclusions.</p>

    <p>There are to things to be done when somebody stretches only
    a finger: one is to seize the whole hand, to obtrude oneself;
    the other is to drop the hand that is not held out warmly and
    cordially, or to disappear of one's own free will where one is
    only tolerated.</p>

    <p>Have I been mistaken, &ldquo;qu'en sais-je?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There is a bond between you and me which continuous work can
    only strengthen in the course of time - this is art, and I hope
    we shall continue to understand each other after all.</p>

    <p>I am afraid I have said something to you about my work which
    I ought to have said differently, and I have a vague feeling of
    having hurt you by something, because there seemed to be
    something amiss when you left.</p>

    <p>I hope it will redress itself.</p>

    <p>About my work, what is becoming more and more clear to me
    since I first noticed it is the dryness of execution.</p>

    <p>This would alarm me if I did not think it a natural
    consequence (which I have also discovered in the early work of
    a great many very sympathetic persons) - a natural consequence
    of the great strain of overcoming the initial difficulties. And
    looking back on the last years, I see them full of troubles;
    but when these troubles have been overcome, I hope another
    period of work will follow.</p>

    <p>That fault is so persistent, and correcting it is so urgent,
    that we must try to take such measures as will bring us a
    period of peace. That must be the first thing, otherwise it
    will remain as it is. As my work is, so am I. You must bear
    with me a little. I do not know whether you think it would be
    better to go and see people like Herkomer, Green or Small
    <i>now</i>, or to <i>wait</i> till the work as well as myself
    have quieted down a little. I should prefer the latter; perhaps
    things will clear up within me soon, but for the moment I had
    better not get myself involved in the complicated London
    business.</p>

    <p>As to the few things you said to me when you left, I hope
    you will not forget that, for instance, your remarks about my
    clothes, etc., are rather exaggerated. Is it indeed as you say?
    Well, I am ready to plead guilty, but it seems to me it is an
    old point of discord which has turned up again, rather than one
    founded on recent observation, except when I'm working
    out-of-doors in the fields or in the studio.</p>

    <p>If you really want to help me in this, you must not hurry
    me.</p>

    <p>Last year I was, so to speak, quite without any social
    contact.</p>

    <p>And it's true that I haven't paid the slightest attention to
    my clothes.</p>

    <p>If that's the only thing, it's not so difficult to correct,
    is it? Especially now that I have that new suit of yours.</p>

    <p>I just wish with all my heart that they would bear with my
    shortcomings, instead of gossiping about them.</p>

    <p>If it puts me in a bad mood, it's because I've heard so much
    about it already. At one time I dressed well, at another, less
    so; it is like the story of the farmer, his son and the ass,
    the moral of which you know, that it is difficult to please
    everybody.</p>

    <p>Coming from you, it surprised more than it angered me,
    because you know how much worry it has caused me already, and
    that it has become a bit of gossip that will never die out,
    what ever I do. Well, at all events, I now have that new suit
    of yours, and the old one, which is still quite good. So for
    the present that's the end of it, and no more about it.</p>

    <p><label content="fear.shyness">And now I will tell you once more what I think about selling
    my work. My opinion is that the best thing would be to work on
    till art lovers feel drawn towards it of their own accord,
    instead of having to praise or explain it. At all events, when
    they refuse it or do not like it, one must bear it calmly and
    with as much dignity as possible.</p>

    <p>I'm so afraid that the steps I might take to introduce
    myself would do more harm than good, and I wish I could avoid
    it.</p>

    <p>It is practically always so painful for me to speak to other
    people.</label></p>

    <p>I am not afraid of it, but I know I make an unfavorable
    impression. The chance of changing this is sometimes destroyed
    by the fact that one's work would suffer if one lived
    differently. And by sticking to one's work, things will come
    out right in the end. For instance, take Mesdag, a real
    mastodon or hippopotamus, but he sells his pictures. I am not
    that far yet, but the man I mention also began late and worked
    his way along an honest, manly path, wherever he may be in
    other respects. I don't leave things undone from laziness, but
    rather to be able to work more, putting aside everything that
    does not belong directly to the work.</p>

    <p>If I were only a little more advanced, so that my work were
    more saleable, I should decidedly say, I leave the business
    part to you, I won't have anything to do with the selling. I
    will live quite outside that circle.</p>

    <p>But now, alas, I cannot say that yet, and that is not your
    fault, but in the interests of both of us and for the sake of
    peace I beg you to have patience.</p>

    <p>I am awfully sorry that I am a burden to you - perhaps
    things will clear up - but if you stagger under it, tell me so
    plainly. I would rather give up everything than put too heavy a
    burden on your shoulders. Then I shall definitely go to London
    at once to work at &ldquo;n'importe quoi,&rdquo; even carrying
    parcels, and I will leave art till better times, at least the
    painting and having as studio. When I look back on the past, I
    always run up against the same never quite cleared up fatal
    facts which occurred in the months from August, 1881 till
    February, 1882.</p>

    <p>That is why I can't help mentioning the same names. Which
    seemed to astonish you.</p>

    <p>Dear brother, don't think of me as anything other than an
    ordinary painter who is confronted by ordinary difficulties,
    and do not think the worries at all unusual.</p>

    <p>I mean, don't think of the future as a darkness or as a
    dazzling light; it will be better to believe in the grey.</p>

    <p>I try to do the same, and think it wrong of myself to
    deviate from it. Goodbye.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>About the woman - I don't doubt but you will understand that
    on my part I do not want to be brusque.</p>

    <p>I must refer again to what you said on leaving, &ldquo;I
    begin to think more and more like Father.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, that may be so. You speak the truth, and for my part -
    though I don't exactly think and act in that way - I respect
    that character, and perhaps know its weak points, but also the
    good ones. And I think that if Father knew something about art,
    it would undoubtedly be easier for me to talk with him and to
    agree with him. Suppose you become like Father, plus your
    knowledge of art - all right - I think we shall continue to
    understand each other.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.Father">I have quarreled with Father very often, but the bond
    between us has never quite been broken.</label></p>

    <p>Well, let nature simply follow its own course in this - you
    will become what you must, I too will not remain exactly the
    same as I am now; let's not suspect each other of absurd things
    and we shall get on together. And let's not forget that we have
    known each other from childhood, and that thousands of other
    things can bring us more and more together.</p>

    <p>I am a little worried about what seemed to worry you, and I
    doubt if I know exactly what was the matter, or rather I
    believe it is caused less by one definite thing than by the
    fact that there are some points in which our characters differ,
    and that you understand one thing better, I another.</p>

    <p>I think it would be well for us to try to stick
    together.</p>

    <p>One thing - if I become too much of a burden to you, let the
    friendship remain, even though you help me less in money
    matters. I shall grumble now and then - but it will be without
    any mental reservation and more to give vent to my feelings
    than expecting or demanding that you do everything, which you
    know I wouldn't do, boy!</p>

    <p>I feel guilty about having said things that I should like to
    take back after all, or wish to have left unsaid - or even if
    you should admit that there was a grain of truth in them, they
    ought to be considered as very exaggerated. For know it well
    that the main fault, the one compared to which all the others
    fade into nothing, which will remain so whatever the future may
    be, is a feeling of gratitude towards you.</p>

    <p>Further, if I am less happy in the future, I would in no
    case - I repeat, in no case - you understand - even if you had
    quite withdrawn your help - I would never consider it your
    fault.</p>

    <p>It would be superfluous to say this if, under the influence
    of my nerves, which were too upset, I had not expressed myself
    to the effect that in the past you might have done more. Forget
    that, please, consider it unsaid. I think if certain things
    will come right, time will bring them so, if I am calm. But in
    my nervousness, I put the blame now on one thing, then another.
    It's the same with other things that I will not repeat now,
    though I always remember afterward even what I said in my
    excitement, and to a certain extent there is always a grain of
    truth in it; but not all principles are absolute, and in
    nervous excitement they often seem more important than they
    are. As for me, though it seemed something was the matter when
    you left, I'll drop it.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">Indeed, I am thinking of what you said and of what I wrote
    you about my clothes; I am not reluctant, and think you are
    perfectly right when you say that if I ever went to see
    Herkomer, or others, they would notice my appearance - but I
    know that myself without your saying so. </label>Further, what you said
    about Father - now there has been occasion to write more often
    to him than usual, and you will read the letter yourself. And
    so it is with everything. In short, when I give an opinion
    about persons, circumstances, a society in which I do not move,
    you may understand that I do not always speak justly, but let
    my imagination roam without regard to reality, and that I see
    things in a very fantastic way, just as things may appear
    strange when seen against the light.</p>

    <p>You who are nearer to them do not understand how it is
    possible for them to appear this way, seen it at a distance and
    from behind. And even if I should see things quite incorrectly,
    anybody who thought about it would perhaps understand that
    given such and such circumstances, I could hardly speak
    differently. Things went wrong during a short period, and that
    short period cannot but continuously occupy my thoughts and I
    think it natural for that moment to cause a reaction even in
    the future, because, although people avoid each other on
    purpose, inevitably they must in time face each other
    again.</p>
