  <body>
    <p>Antwerp, 1<sup>st</sup> half February 1886</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I decidedly want to tell you that it would make me feel much
    better if you would approve of my coming to Paris much earlier
    than June or July. The more I think about it, the more anxious
    I am to do so.</p>

    <p>Just think, if all goes well, and if I had good food, etc.,
    all that time, which certainly will leave something to be
    desired, even in that case it will take about six months before
    I shall have recovered entirely.</p>

    <p>But it would certainly take a much longer time if between
    March and July I had to go through the same things in Brabant
    as I have had to go through these last months - and probably it
    wouldn't be any different.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">Now, at this moment, I am feeling terribly weak, even worse
    than that, from reaction after overwork, but that is the
    natural course of things and nothing extraordinary; but as it
    is a question of taking better nourishment, etc., you see in
    Brabant I shall again spend my last penny on models; it will be
    the same story all over again, and I do not think that will be
    right. </label>In that way we stray from our path. So please allow me
    to come sooner, I should almost say at once.</p>

    <p>If I rent a garret in Paris, and bring my paintbox and
    drawing materials with me, then I can finish what is most
    pressing at once - those studies from the ancients, which
    certainly will help me a great deal when I go to Cormon's. I
    can go and draw either at the Louvre or at the Ecole des
    Beaux-Arts.</p>

    <p>For the rest, before settling in a new place, we could plan
    and arrange things so much better. If it must be, I am willing
    to go to Nuenen for the month of March, to see how things are
    there and how the people are and whether or not I can get
    models there. But if not so, which I presume to be the case, I
    should go straight to Paris after March, and start drawing at
    the Louvre, for instance.</p>

    <p>I have carefully thought over what you wrote about taking a
    studio, but I think it would be a good thing if we looked for
    it together, and if before going to live together definitely,
    we did so temporarily, and if I began by renting a garret, say
    from April till June.</p>

    <p>Then I shall feel at home again in Paris by the time I go to
    Cormon's.</p>

    <p>And in this way I shall keep up my spirits better.</p>

    <p>I must also tell you that, although I keep going there, that
    nagging of those fellows at the academy is often almost
    unbearable, for they remain positively spiteful.</p>

    <p>But I try systematically to avoid all quarrels, and go my
    own way. And I feel I am on the track of what I am seeking, and
    perhaps I should find it the sooner if I could go my own way
    when drawing from the plaster casts.</p>

    <p>After all I am glad I went to the academy, for the very
    reason that I have abundant opportunity to observe the results
    of <i>prendre par le contour</i>.</p>

    <p>For that is what they do systematically, and that is why
    they nag me. &ldquo;Faites d'abord un contour, votre contour
    n'est pas juste, je ne corrigerai pas &ccedil;a, si vous
    modelez avant d'avoir s&eacute;rieusement arr&ecirc;t&eacute;
    votre contour.&rdquo; [First make a contour, your contour isn't
    right; I won't correct it if you do your modelling before
    having seriously fixed your contour.]</p>

    <p>You see that it always comes to the same thing. And now you
    ought to see how flat, how lifeless and how insipid the results
    of that system are; oh, I can tell you I am very glad just to
    be able to see it close up. Like David, or even worse, like
    Pieneman in full bloom. I wanted to say at least twenty-five
    times, &ldquo;Votre contour est un truc, [Your contour is a
    joke] etc.&rdquo; but I have not thought it worth while to
    quarrel. Yet I irritate them even though I don't say anything;
    and they, me.</p>

    <p>But this doesn't matter so much, the problem is to go on
    trying to find a better working method. So - patience and
    perseverance.</p>

    <p>They go so far as to say, &ldquo;La couleur et le
    model&eacute; c'est peu de chose, cela s'apprend tr&egrave;s
    vite, c'est le contour qui est l'essentiel et le plus
    difficile.&rdquo; [Colour and modelling aren't much, one can
    learn that very quickly, it's the contour that is essential and
    the most difficult.]</p>

    <p>You see, one can learn some new things at the academy. I
    never knew before that colour and modelling came so easily.</p>

    <p>Just yesterday I finished the drawing I made for the evening
    class's competition. It is the figure of Germanicus that you
    know. Well, I am sure I shall place last, because all the
    drawings of the others are exactly alike, and mine is
    absolutely different. But I saw how that drawing they will
    think best was made. I was sitting just behind it, and it is
    correct, it is whatever you like, but it is <i>dead</i>, and
    that's what all the drawings I saw are.</p>

    <p>Enough of this, but let it annoy us so much that it makes us
    enthusiastic for something nobler, and that we hasten to
    achieve this.</p>

    <p>You, too, need a more vigorous life, and if we might succeed
    in joining hands, together we should know more than each
    separately, and should be able to do more.</p>

    <p>Tell me, did you notice that ingenious saying of Paul
    Mantz's, &ldquo;<i>Dans la vie les femmes sont peut &ecirc;tre
    la difficult&eacute; supr&ecirc;me</i>.&rdquo; It was in an
    article on Baudry.</p>

    <p>We shall experience our share of it, besides the experience
    we may have already gathered.</p>

    <p>In a chapter in L'Oeuvre by Zola, in the Gil Blas, it struck
    me that the painter, Manet of course, had a scene with a woman
    who had posed for him, and to whom he had later become
    indifferent, oh - curiously well described. What one can learn
    in this respect from the academy here is never to paint
    women.</p>

    <p>They hardly ever use nude women models. At least not at all
    in the class, and it's extremely unusual privately.</p>

    <p>Even in the antiquities class there are ten men's figures to
    one woman's figure. That is easy enough.</p>

    <p>In Paris, of course, this will be better, and it seems to me
    that, in fact, one learns so much from the constant comparing
    of the male figure with the female, which are always and in
    everything so totally different. It may be
    &ldquo;supremely&rdquo; difficult, but what would art and what
    would life be without it?</p>

    <p>Goodbye, write me soon. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>My being in Nuenen, at least for the month of March, would
    only be for the moving, and I have to be there also for my
    change of domicile. But as to myself, I am quite willing not to
    go back there at all.</p>
