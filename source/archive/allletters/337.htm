  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>I cannot count the grains in a sack of corn just by smelling
    it - I cannot look through the planks of the barn door - but
    sometimes I can see by the lumps whether it is a sack of
    potatoes or of corn, or, though the barn door be closed, I can
    tell when the pig is killed from the squealing.</p>

    <p>Only in this way can I and will I judge the circumstances in
    which you find yourself just now, from the indications I have,
    however vague they may be, and it is not a prophecy I am
    making.</p>

    <p>But now to the point! Just consider coolly whether you are
    not faced by what they call fatality on the battlefield. Just
    consider the faces of your friends, your sham friends and your
    enemies, just consider the je ne sais quois - just consider
    whether a certain void is not developing around you, so that
    you are losing your hold on things, or at any rate so that it
    is less easy for you to put through business deals. In short,
    consider whether this fatality is in your favour or decidedly
    against you.</p>

    <p>Tell me this one thing, am I mistaken when I conclude from
    some symptoms that there is a question of one of those
    malignant crises which at times arise in large businesses in
    the big cities? Do things have a desperate aspect? Do you feel
    this cannot be redressed? Or do you feel redress is possible,
    and that therefore this crisis is no reason to change your
    position?</p>

    <p>Unless you write me, &ldquo;No, it is not so bad as
    that,&rdquo; I personally think matters have a rather desperate
    aspect.</p>

    <p>Think it over cool-headedly - I know you have your
    composure, your presence of mind, I know you try to analyze
    things, and for this reason I should like to know if you
    yourself see something which I fear is there.</p>

    <p>You know, boy - as long as the position was tolerable - as
    long as business was possible, I have never dared to advise you
    openly, Give it up, especially out of respect for your
    position, which you kept, not for your own pleasure, but for
    the welfare of us all.</p>

    <p>But your former duties, which, moreover, you have taken on
    yourself of your own free will, cease to be duties when
    business conditions become such that to continue would not only
    be a hopeless struggle, but at the same time would inevitably
    bring about your own ruin.</p>

    <p>In short, there are limits, and my intuition tells me you
    have almost reached that point.</p>

    <p>Look here - as regards now or never - making oneself scarce
    or disappearing, neither you nor I should <i>ever</i> do that,
    no more than commit suicide.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">I too have my moments of deep melancholy, but I say again,
    both you and I ought to regard the idea of disappearing or
    making oneself scarce as becoming neither you nor me.</label></p>

    <p>And notwithstanding all, one should take the risk of going
    on, even when one feels that it is <i>impossible</i>, of
    going on with the desperate feeling that it will end in
    disappearance - but on the other hand, in our consciences there
    is that &ldquo;<i>beware!!!&rdquo;</i></p>

    <p>Should I be mistaken - should my presentiment be at variance
    with the facts, about which I ask you the question, Have they a
    decidedly desperate aspect or not? - very well, then I am
    willing to believe your simple assurance, I expect things to
    come out right, or some such words, <i>as soon as you write me
    that</i>.</p>

    <p>In the event of your being faced with a fait accompli in one
    of those venomous crises such as Paris and London produce - if
    this is so definitely to be expected that you feel it is a
    power that would crush you if they should try to force the
    worst to happen by resorting to a maneuver of opposition -
    well, under these circumstances leave the sinking ship, and
    concentrate your mind and energy, not on clinging to your
    present position, but on creating something wholly new. For a
    long time your <i>duty</i> has seemed too complicated to me;
    your duty ought to be something simple, and your present duty
    would grow more and more involved and doubtful, leaving the
    question of whether I think it is really and truly your duty
    out of it. By starting to paint, you will find a very clear
    duty and a very simple, straight path for your feet.</p>

    <p>My idea is that going on in your present situation would
    prove to be not only more and more unbearable, but also less
    and less profitable. I do not say this only as far as Goupil
    &amp; Co. is concerned, but also in general with regard to you
    as a <i>dealer</i>. I do not say that you and I will get
    rich together, but in any case we shall be able to preserve our
    aplomb and our balance, although - I cannot deny this - we
    shall have a very hard time of it during the first few
    years.</p>

    <p>But I see not <i>the unfavourable</i> but <i>the
    favourable</i> fatality hovering over our painting enterprise,
    but you would crush not only yourself but me too, I am afraid,
    by carrying through something which in my opinion goes utterly
    against the grain. In the first place we shall not be able to
    assist each other, and we shall be too much cast upon
    ourselves, and in the second place we shall make each other
    waver by working in diametrically opposite directions, so that
    notwithstanding our friendship, at times we shall have to turn
    our backs on each other</p>

    <p>Well, my dear fellow, to me painting is too logical, too
    reasonable, too straightforward to allow me personally ever to
    change my course. Besides, you yourself helped me realize the
    idea of a handicraft, and I know that basically it is your idea
    too, so I think we ought to cooperate from now on.</p>

    <p>My reason, my conscience, compel me to tell you what is
    partially your own view too; there is nothing to fall back on
    but a <i>radical</i> renewal.</p>

    <p>I know that my words will be in strange contrast to those of
    others you might consult, who want to pass the matter off with,
    &ldquo;It will come out all right,&rdquo; &ldquo;The desired
    changes will occur.&rdquo; I do not wish to flatter you, all
    right, I do not flatter. As to rousing your courage, yes, I
    dare to, I dare rouse the very highest courage and serenity in
    you, but only as regards painting; and about Paris, I can only
    say this, Look well, and see if <i>fate</i> is not against you
    on that battlefield.</p>

    <p>As far as I can see, going on in Paris, even if you were
    able to stick it out for many years, will not grant you peace,
    and there would not be so much opportunity for being as useful
    to others as if you were a painter.</p>

    <p>I see that Paris will put you into what I would call a
    crooked position in regard to <i>your own duty</i>. Leaving
    your being useful to others out of it for the moment, seeing
    that I do not know if <i>in the long run</i> I myself should
    remain truly firm, because you are directing the simpler minds
    of others toward Paris, a thought which will disturb exactly
    <i>these</i> people because they <i>might</i> be intoxicated by
    it.</p>

    <p>Understand clearly what I say: Until now everything has had
    its reason, but now the signs of the times suggest a change of
    direction, as I see it, in a way quite different from and far
    more decisive than anything in the past.</p>

    <p>There is no question of slackening or giving in here; on the
    contrary, in this there is an attacking the calamity at the
    core: the same energetic principle as that of sowing superior
    plants in better soil.</p>

    <p>The calamity leaves us our old courage and our old earnest
    energy. Let the world say venomously what it cannot refrain
    from saying; it will leave you and me cold. On the contrary, we
    are counting on the possibility of a hard life which will have
    a purpose other than earning as much money as possible.</p>

    <p>Our purpose is in the first place self-reform by means of a
    handicraft and of intercourse with nature, believing as we do
    that this is our first duty in order to be honest with others
    and to be consistent - our aim is walking with God - the
    opposite of living in the midst of the doings of the big
    cities.</p>

    <p>We shall not harm anybody by this.</p>

    <p>Though some people may think it hypocritical to say so, our
    belief is that God will help those who help themselves, as long
    as they turn their energy and attention in this direction, and
    set to work <i>to this end</i>.</p>

    <p>I see that Millet believed more and more firmly in
    &ldquo;Something on High.&rdquo; He spoke of it in a way quite
    different than, for instance, Father does. He left it more
    vague, but for all that, I see more in Millet's vagueness than
    in what Father says. And I find that same quality of Millet's
    in Rembrandt, in Corot - in short, in the work of many, though
    I must not and cannot expatiate on this. The end of things need
    not be the power to explain them, but basing oneself
    effectively upon them.</p>

    <p>In short, Theo, I have a vague but firm feeling that it is
    our first duty to fix the heart on high, and this feeling
    forces me to recommend to you, brother to brother, friend to
    friend, preparing yourself for a life based on simpler
    principles. Principles which I am unable to define for others,
    but which I feel; one can hardly imagine <i>duty</i> commanding
    one to <i>do business in Paris</i>; rather, it will induce one
    to retire from it.</p>

    <p>Can you share these feelings to a certain extent? Think it
    over, deliberate on it; if you want time, search your heart,
    and take your time. All hesitation based on the objection
    &ldquo;I am not an artist&rdquo; seems reasonable to me only as
    long as you do <i>not</i> prevent yourself from <i>becoming
    one</i><i>.</i> To what degree we <i>are</i> or are <i>not</i>
    artists, neither we ourselves nor others can definitely
    ascertain. However, the How-to-do-it system entails saying, I
    <i>shall do my best to do it</i>, without asking any such
    questions; on the other hand, it seems to me that it is the
    How-NOT-to-do-it system which says, &ldquo;I know in advance I
    shall not be able to do it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>One is not sure of things all at once, one cannot foresee
    things except very vaguely, but there is something called
    conscience after all, a kind of compass by which one can
    distinguish between this direction and that - between North and
    South - between right and left - at least broadly speaking.
    Which means - notwithstanding fortuitous currents and certain
    deceptively inviting coasts - being able to say, This is not
    the right course for me after all. And look, earning money in
    Paris, even for others' sakes, would, considering your recent
    experiences, seem to me such a deceptive fata morgana: a coast
    that recedes more and more when you approach to make a landing
    <i>there</i>, at the same time causing you to be driven farther
    and farther off your course. I respect all hesitations and
    doubts, I respect your weighing all the pros and cons, I will
    not try to force an immediate decision upon you. But I only
    point out very, very seriously that in my opinion it is an
    incontrovertible fact that you are standing at a crossroads,
    and that you will have to look before you leap to the decision
    simply to continue in Paris. The signs of the times, not I,
    say: Wait a bit! What do you want? Do you choose Paris? All
    right, if you <i>have made up your mind</i> that it is to be
    so, then I should not want to interfere; but it will not be as
    easy as all that, and I am afraid you will be in for fatality.
    I am damned doubtful whether you will remain at peace with your
    lot.</p>

    <p>I see <i>everything except</i> fatality against painting;
    <i>for</i> Paris I see everything <i>except</i> fatality!</p>

    <p>Fatality, in which with an unutterable feeling I see God,
    Who is the White Ray of Light, and Who has the last word; what
    is not good through and through is not good at all, and will
    not last - He, in Whose eyes even the Black Ray will have no
    plausible meaning.</p>

    <p>What is before you is something terrible, something
    &ldquo;awful&rdquo; - those things are so inexpressible that I
    can find no words for them; and if I were not your brother and
    your friend, who considers being silent ungrateful as well as
    inhuman, I should say nothing. But seeing that you say, First,
    inspire me with courage, and second, do not flatter me, I say
    now, Look, I see all these things here on the silent moor,
    where I feel God high above you and me. With a warm
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
