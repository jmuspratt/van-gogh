  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>On the occasion of the first of May [Theo's birthday] I wish
    you a tolerably good year, and above all good health.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">How I should like to pass on to you some of my physical
    strength. I have the feeling I've too much of it at the moment.
    Which does not prevent my head from still not being all that it
    should be.</label></p>

    <p>How right Delacroix was, who lived on bread and wine alone,
    and who succeeded in finding a way of life in keeping with his
    vocation. But the inevitable question of money is ever-present
    - Delacroix had private means. Corot too. And Millet - Millet
    was a peasant and the son of a peasant.</p>

    <p>You may perhaps be interested in reading this article I cut
    out of a Marseilles paper because one catches a glimpse of
    Monticelli in it, and I find the description of the painting
    representing a corner of the churchyard very interesting. But
    alas, it's yet another deplorable story.</p>

    <p>How sad it is to think that a painter who succeeds, even if
    only in part, pulls along half a dozen artists who are worse
    failures than himself.</p>

    <p>However, remember Pangloss, remember Bouvard et
    P&eacute;cuchet - I do - and even that becomes clear
    then. But perhaps those people don't know Pangloss, or else,
    fatally marked by real despair and great suffering, they have
    forgotten all they knew about him.</p>

    <p>And anyway, we are falling back again in the name of
    optimism on a religion that strikes me as the rear end of some
    sort of Buddhism. No harm in that, on the contrary, if that's
    what one wants.</p>

    <p>I don't like the article on Monet in the Figaro very much -
    how much better that other article in the 19<sup>me</sup>
    Si&eacute;cle was! One could see the pictures in that, and
    this one is full of nothing but depressing banalities.</p>

    <p>Today I am stuck in the middle of packing a case of pictures
    and studies. I've stuck some newspapers on to one which is
    flaking - it's one of the best, and I think that when you've
    had a look at it you'll understand more clearly what my studio,
    now come to grief, could have been. This study, just like some
    of the others, was spoiled by the damp while I was ill.</p>

    <p>The flood water came up to within a stone's throw of the
    house, and more important, since the house wasn't heated during
    my absence, by the time I got back water and saltpeter were
    oozing from the walls.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">That was a blow to me, since not only the studio had come to
    grief, but even the studies that would have been reminders of
    it. It is all so final, and my urge to found something very
    simple but lasting was so strong. I was fighting a losing
    battle, or rather it was weakness of character on my part, for
    I am left with feelings of deep remorse about it, difficult to
    describe. I think that was the reason I cried out so much
    during the attacks - I wanted to defend myself and couldn't do
    it. For it was not to me, it was precisely to painters such as
    the poor wretch about whom the enclosed article speaks that the
    studio could have been of use.</label></p>

    <p>In fact, we had several predecessors. Bruyas at Montpellier
    gave a whole fortune to that, a whole life, and without the
    slightest apparent result.</p>

    <p>Yes - a chilly room in the municipal gallery where you can
    see a troubled face and many fine pictures, where you certainly
    feel moved, but, alas, moved as in a graveyard.</p>

    <p>Yet it would be difficult to walk through a graveyard that
    demonstrated more clearly the existence of that
    Esp&eacute;rance which Puvis de Chavannes has
    painted.</p>

    <p>Pictures fade like flowers - even some of Delacroix's have
    suffered in this way, the magnificent Daniel, Les odalisques
    (quite different from those in the Louvre, it was in a single
    range of purplish-blue), but how they impressed me, those
    pictures fading there, little understood, that's for sure, by
    most of the visitors who look at Courbet and Cabanel and Victor
    Giraud, etc.</p>

    <p>What are we, we other painters?</p>

    <p>Oh, well, I'm sure Richepin is quite right, for instance
    when he brutally bursts in and consigns them straight back to
    the madhouse with his profanities.</p>

    <p>However, I assure you that I know of no hospital where they
    would be willing to take me in for nothing, even supposing that
    I myself shouldered the painting expenses and left the whole of
    my work to the hospital.</p>

    <p>And that is, I don't say a great, but still a small
    injustice. Even so, I should feel resigned if one took me in.
    If I were without your friendship, they would drive me
    remorselessly to suicide, and coward that I am, I should end by
    committing it. At this point, I hope, we are permitted to
    protest against society and to defend ourselves.</p>

    <p>We can be fairly sure that the Marseilles artist who
    committed suicide in no way did it under the influence of
    absinthe, for the simple reason that no one is likely to have
    offered him any and he could not have had anything to buy it
    with. Besides, he would not have drunk it purely for pleasure,
    but because, being ill already, he kept himself going with
    it.</p>

    <p>M. Salles has been to Saint-R&eacute;my - they are not
    willing to give me permission to paint outside the institution,
    nor take me for less than 100 francs.</p>

    <p>So this is pretty bad news.</p>

    <p>If I could get out of this mess by joining the Foreign
    Legion for 5 years, I think I should prefer that.</p>

    <p>For on the one hand, being locked up and not working, I
    should find it hard to get better, and on the other hand, they
    would make us pay 100 francs a month during the whole long life
    of a madman.</p>

    <p>It's a bad business, and what are we to make of it? But
    would they be willing to have me as a soldier?</p>

    <p>I feel very tired after the conversation with M. Salles, and
    I don't quite know what to do. I myself advised Bernard to do
    his service there, so it's hardly surprising that I'm
    considering going to Arabia as a soldier myself.</p>

    <p>I say that so you will not blame me too much if I do go.
    Everything else is so vague and so strange. And you know how
    doubtful it is that one will ever get back what it costs to
    paint. For the rest, it seems I am physically well.</p>

    <p>Supposing I am only allowed to work under supervision! And
    in the institution - my God, is it worth paying money for that?
    In that case I could certainly work just as well, even better,
    in the barracks.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I'm thinking about it. You do so as well. Let us
    remember that all is for the best in the best of all worlds -
    it's not impossible.</p>

    <p>A really good handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Here is what I think is worth putting on stretchers from the
    consignment.</p>

    <p>The packing case contains some studies by Gauguin which
    belong to him, and his two fencing masks and some fencing
    gloves.</p>

    <p>If there is room in the packing case, I'll add some
    stretchers.</p>
