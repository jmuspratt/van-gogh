  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Adam Bede costs 2.60 guilders, so I am sending you back 1.40
    guilders. Now I only hope they will enjoy the book at home, but
    they certainly will. Thanks for your letter, which gave me much
    pleasure. The next time we meet, we shall be as good friends as
    ever; sometimes I feel so delighted that we are again living on
    the same soil and speaking the same language.</p>

    <p>Last week we had a flood here. Coming from the store at
    night, between twelve and one, I walked around the cathedral;
    the wind raged in the elm trees around it, and the moon shone
    through the rain clouds and was reflected in the canals, which
    were already filled to overflowing. At three o'clock that
    morning everybody in Rijken the grocer's house, where I live,
    was busy carrying the things from the shop upstairs, as the
    water in the house had risen to three feet. There was no little
    noise and bustle: on all the ground floors people were busy
    carrying things upstairs, and a little boat came floating
    through the street.</p>

    <p>In the morning at daybreak I saw a group of men at the other
    end of the street; one after the other they waded through the
    water to their warehouses. Much damage has been done. The water
    also penetrated the place where Mr. Braat keeps his paper,
    etc.; it was not flooded from the outside, but by underground
    seepage. Mr. Braat says that it will cost him a lot of money.
    We have been busy a day and a half carrying everything upstairs
    into another house. Working with one's hands for a day is a
    rather agreeable diversion - if only it had been for another
    reason.</p>

    <p>You ought to have seen the sunset that evening; the streets
    seemed of gold, the way Cuyp used to paint them. I am eager for
    my trunk, which is on the way, especially so that I may put my
    prints up in my room again. The only ones I have up now are
    &ldquo;Christus Consolator,&rdquo; which you gave me, and two
    English woodcuts of <art id=emmaus>the &ldquo;Men of Emmaus.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
    toward evening, and the day is far spent. - And another one,
    Those that sat in darkness and the shadow of death have seen a
    great light, weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in
    the morning.</p>

    <p><label subject="psychology.depression">It may be that
    there is a time in life when one is tired of
    everything and feels, perhaps correctly, as if all one does is
    wrong - do you think this is a feeling one must try to avoid
    and to banish, or is it &ldquo;the sorrow for God,&rdquo; which
    one must not fear, but cherish to see if it may bring some
    good? </label>Is it &ldquo;the sorrowing for God&rdquo; which leads us
    to make &ldquo;a choice that we will never regret?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And at such a time, when one is weary of oneself, one should
    think with devotion, hope and love of the words: &ldquo;Come
    unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
    give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am
    meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest upon your
    souls.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;If any man will come after me, let him deny himself,
    and take up my cross, and follow me.&rdquo; At such a time one
    may well think: &ldquo;Except a man be born again, he cannot
    see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If we let ourselves be taught by the experience of life, and
    led by the sorrowing for God, vital strength may spring from
    the weary heart. If only we are truly weary, we shall believe
    in God all the more firmly, and shall find in Christ, through
    His word, a friend and a Comforter. And days may come when we
    feel: &ldquo;Thou removest my iniquities from me as far as the
    East is from the West&rdquo; [sic, Ps. 103:12], and when we may
    feel something of &ldquo;the zeal for Thine house hath consumed
    me&rdquo; [sic, Ps. 69:9] and &ldquo;our God is a consuming
    fire,&rdquo; when we shall know what it means to be ardent in
    spirit. &ldquo;Not always shall hope droop.&rdquo; Let us not
    forget &ldquo;the things which we heard in the
    beginning.&rdquo; In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
    was with God, and the Word was God. For God so loved the world,
    that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
    him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Nothing shall
    separate us from the Love of Christ, neither things present nor
    things to come.</p>

    <p>[Translation of the whole poem]</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Rejoice, oh earth, rejoice unto God on high;<br>

    Let grateful tears flow from thine eye<br>

    For Him, the All-bountiful;<br>

    Gaily celebrate this joyful day,<br>

    The most beautiful the world<br>

    Has ever seen glow on her horizon.<br>

    We still can hear the cheering of that blissful night<br>

    When the stars with new splendour<br>

    And the Host of Angels with new gladness<br>

    Rejoiced in the coming of Jesus.<br>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    As pants the hart for cooling streams<br>

    <p>O mijn ziel, wat buigt ge u neder&hellip;[For translation
    see Letter 82a]</p>

    <p>Last Sunday I was in the French church here, which is a very
    solemn and dignified and has something most attractive about
    it. The text was, &ldquo;Hold that fast which thou hast, that
    no man take thy crown.&rdquo; The sermon closed with: &ldquo;If
    I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
    cunning.&rdquo; After church I went for a lovely walk along a
    dyke past the mills; the glittering sky over the meadows was
    reflected in the ditches.</p>

    <p>There are some special things in other countries, for
    instance the French coast I saw at Dieppe: the cliffs topped
    with green grass, the sea and the sky, the harbour with the old
    boats as if painted by Daubigny, with brown nets and sails, the
    small houses, among them a few restaurants, with little white
    curtains and green pine branches at the windows, the carts with
    white horses harnessed in large blue halters and red tassels,
    the drivers with their blue smocks, the fishermen with their
    beards and oilskins, and the French women with pale faces,
    dark, often rather deep-set eyes, black dresses and white caps.
    And, for instance, the streets of London in the rain with the
    lamps, and a night spent there on the steps of a little old
    grey church, as happened to me this summer after that trip from
    Ramsgate.</p>

    <p>There are indeed some special things in other countries, but
    last Sunday, when I walked on that dyke, I thought how good it
    felt to be on Dutch soil, and I felt something like, &ldquo;Now
    it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the Lord
    God!&rdquo; <label content="feelings.nostalgia">For the memory
    of old times came back to me, among
    other things how we used to walk with Father to Rijsbergen,
    etc., during the last days of February and heard the lark above
    the black fields with young green corn, beheld the sparkling
    blue sky with the white clouds above, and then the paved path
    with the beech trees.</p>

    <p>Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Or rather, Oh, Zundert! Oh,
    Zundert! Who knows if we might not walk together beside the sea
    this summer! We must stay good friends, anyway, Theo, and just
    believe in God and trust with an abiding trust in Him who
    presides over prayer and over thought - who can tell to what
    heights grace can rise?</label></p>

    <p>Warmest congratulations on today [Their father's birthday] -
    it is already half-past one and so it is the eighth of February
    - may God spare us our father for a long time yet and may
    &ldquo;He bind us closely to one another, and may our love for
    Him strengthen our bonds ever more.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Father wrote that he had already seen starlings. Do you
    still remember how they used to perch on the church at Zundert?
    So far I have not noticed any here, but I did see a great many
    crows on the Great Church in the morning. Now it will soon be
    spring again and the larks, too, will be returning. &ldquo;He
    reneweth the face of the earth,&rdquo; and it is written:
    &ldquo;Behold, I make all things new,&rdquo; and much as He
    renews the face of the earth, so He can also renew and
    strengthen man's soul and heart and mind. The nature of every
    true son does indeed bear some resemblance to that of the son
    who was dead and came back to life. Let us not forget the text
    &ldquo;sorrowful yet always rejoicing,&rdquo; &ldquo;unknown
    and yet well known,&rdquo; and write the word <i>weemoed</i>
    [melancholy] as two words, <i>wee</i> [woe] and <i>moed</i>
    [courage] and faith in God, who in His time can cause the
    loneliness which we sometimes feel even in the midst of a
    crowd, to fall from us. He, of whom Joseph said, &ldquo;He hath
    made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.&rdquo;
    And yet Joseph had not forgotten his father, as well you know,
    but you also know what he meant by his words.</p>

    <p>Take care of yourself, give my regards to all at the Roos's
    and above all to Mr. and Mrs. Tersteeg, and accept a handshake
    in my thoughts and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your very loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Tell Mr. Tersteeg not to take it amiss that the drawing
    samples have been kept for so long. They are for the H. B.
    school [Hogere Burgerschool (high school)] and there are 30
    already there. But they also want to choose some for the
    evening classes and so they need to keep them for about a week
    longer. You will have them back as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>[In the margin] Send me that page from Michelet again, my
    boy. The one you sent me before is in the box in my desk and I
    need it. Write again soon.</p>
