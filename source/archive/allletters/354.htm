    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Up to now Mother has been pretty well, in so far as the leg
    remains in its bandage as it was set.</p>

    <p>But for all that, the days are rather gloomy. And I am
    afraid lying still in bed will become more and more difficult
    for Mother.</p>

    <p>We have just been talking over your letter, in which you
    write you intend to come.</p>

    <p>Of course it would be a great joy for Mother to see you, but
    on the other hand there is something which calls for caution.
    And that is the parting, when you would have to go back.</p>

    <p>And then it <i>might</i> be that Mother might take your
    coming as a sign that she is in a very bad way.</p>

    <p>But it is a fact that Mother would be very glad if you
    came.</p>

    <p>I write about that coming because, in case you should do so,
    I should think it better <i>not to surprise her</i>, but to
    write about it to Mother first.</p>

    <p>If there should unfortunately be a change for the worse, we
    should wire you at once, you may always depend on it. Of
    course, your coming or not is a question which can only be
    decided by yourself. There is no definite, immediate danger,
    but it is impossible to know how things will continue. I
    suppose Father has written you all the details, and he will
    write you again one of these days.</p>

    <p>I have no head for writing now, and I have little time for
    it, for when I am not with Mother, I am near by at the
    weavers', where I am working on two painted studies.</p>

    <p>Write soon again. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
