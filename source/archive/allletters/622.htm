    <p>Letter 622<br>
     Saint-R&eacute;my, 4 January 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter; though I wrote you only
    yesterday, I am answering at once.</p>

    <p>I have never worked with more calm than in my last canvases
    - I hope you will receive some at the same time as this
    letter.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">For the moment I am overcome with discouragement, but since
    this attack was over in a week, what's the use of thinking that
    it may in fact come back again? First of all you do not know,
    and cannot foresee, how or in what form.</label></p>

    <p>Therefore let's go on with the work as long as it is
    possible, as if nothing had happened. I shall soon have an
    opportunity to go out when the weather is not too cold and then
    I have rather set my heart on trying to finish the work I have
    begun here.</p>

    <p>I must do some more canvases of cypresses and mountains to
    give an idea of Provence.</p>

    <p><art id=0662>The &ldquo;Ravine&rdquo;</art> and another canvas
    of mountains, with a road in the foreground are typical of
    it.</p>

    <p>And the &ldquo;Ravine&rdquo; especially, which I still have
    here because it is not dry. And the view of the park, too, with
    the pines. It has taken me all my time to observe the character
    of pines, cypresses, etc., in the pure air here, lines which do
    not alter and which you will find again at every step.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">It is perfectly true that last year the attack returned
    various times - but then also it was precisely by working that
    my normal condition returned little by little. It will probably
    be the same this time. So behave as if nothing had happened for
    we can do absolutely nothing.</p>

    <p>And what would be definitely worse would be to let myself
    slip into the same condition as my companions in misfortune,
    who do nothing all day, week, month, year, as I have told you
    many times, and have also repeated to M. Salles, urging him
    strongly never to recommend this asylum.</label></p>

    <p><label content="health.general">My work at least lets me retain a little of my clarity of
    mind, and makes possible my getting rid of this someday.</label></p>

    <p>Just now some pictures are ripe in my head, I see in advance
    the places that I still want to do in these months. Why should
    I change the means of expression?</p>

    <p>Once away from here - let's suppose so - we must really see
    if something can be done with my canvases. I should have a
    certain number of mine, a certain number of others, and perhaps
    I should try to do a bit of business.</p>

    <p>I do not know yet, but I see no reason for not doing some
    more canvases here, which I shall need when I leave here. Once
    more, I can foresee absolutely nothing, I see no way out, but I
    also see that my stay here cannot go on indefinitely. Then, so
    as to do nothing in a hurry, not to break off abruptly, I would
    like to go on as usual while I am here.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I sent two canvases to Marseilles, that is to say,
    I made a present of them to my friend Roulin: <art id=0664>a white house
    among the olives</art>, and a wheat field with a
    background of lilac mountains and a black tree [Painting lost], as in<art id=0721> the big
    canvas I sent you</art>. And I gave Mr. Salles a little canvas with
    some pink and red geraniums against a background all black
    [Painting lost], just like some I did at one time in Paris.</p>

    <p>As for the money you sent me, 10 francs of it was due M.
    Peyron because he had advanced it to me last month; I had given
    20 francs in New Year's presents and I took 10 of it for the
    postage for the canvases and other expenses, so there still
    remain 10 francs in cash.</p>

    <p>Just now I have done <art id=0665>a little portrait of one of the
    boys here</art>, which he wanted to send to his mother. That
    means I have already started working again, and if he saw any
    objection, Mr. Peyron would probably not have let me do it.
    What he said to me was - &ldquo;Let's hope that there will be
    no recurrence&rdquo; - exactly the same thing as ever; he spoke
    very kindly to me, and as for him, these things hardly surprise
    him, but since there is no quick remedy, perhaps only time and
    circumstances can have any influence.</p>

    <p>I should very much like to go to Arles again, not
    immediately, but toward the end of February, for instance,
    first of all to see my friends again, which always refreshes
    me, and then to test whether I am capable of risking the
    journey to Paris.</p>

    <p>I'm very happy that our sister has come. Kind regards to her
    and Jo, and as for you and me, don't let's worry. In any case,
    it did not last as long as last year and so we can still hope
    that little by little it will pass in the course of time.</p>

    <p>Well, be of good heart, a hearty handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
