  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Coming home from Scheveningen just now, I find your letter,
    for which many thanks.</p>

    <p>Many things in it please me. In the first place, I am glad
    that the darkness of the future cannot change our friendship or
    interfere with it; further, I am glad that you will come soon,
    and that you find progress in my work.</p>

    <p>The division of your income, directly and indirectly, among
    no less than six persons is certainly remarkable. But the
    subdivision of my 150 francs among four human beings, with all
    the expenses for models, drawing and painting material, house
    rent, is also rather remarkable, isn't it? If those 150 francs
    could be increased by the work next year - I reckon the year
    begins with your visit - that would be delightful. We must find
    ways and means.</p>

    <p>It is a pity that my painting is not more advanced, yet I
    shall have to explain It to you all over again.</p>

    <p>When you were here last summer, you gave me the money to get
    the necessary supplies. I had to pay Stam and Leurs then. I
    bought new things for which I paid cash, and set to work.
    Besides, after some time, you wrote that you expected some
    money to come in, and that then &ldquo;the colours and the
    paintbox should not be lacking.&rdquo; But it was not to be,
    for since that time you yourself had some bad luck, as you
    remember. However, in the beginning of the winter, or rather
    toward the end of autumn, I received some extra money. But
    there was Leurs to pay off again. I had continued painting
    through those autumn days even when it was so stormy in
    Scheveningen. Winter was at the door and I was afraid to incur
    new expenses, as there was more to pay for coal, etc., and
    little of the extra money was left.</p>

    <p>Well, then I took models again, and certainly since then, at
    least up to now, it has been a period in which I feel I've made
    progress in the figure.</p>

    <p>But it was absolutely impossible to buy colours or to make
    watercolours while making those figure studies, for you will
    remember that several times you expected to be able to send
    something, for instance in March, but then you yourself were
    obliged to get an advance.</p>

    <p>And you had to provide for the woman, and there was the
    incident with H. P. v. G.,<sup>1</sup> and later business was
    rather slack.</p>

    <p>Well, sometimes I tried to carry on when there was the least
    chance of managing it. I've borrowed money from Rappard, I've
    had an extra remittance from Father. But what was the result?
    It was like the beetle which is bound to a thread and can fly a
    little way, but is inevitably stopped by something. I began
    things, but after paying the bills, I was hard up for weeks at
    the end of the month, sometimes almost without a penny.</p>

    <p>So that I haven't always been able to do what was, and is,
    in my mind. Well, we must not lose courage, we must try
    again.</p>

    <p>I just came home with a few marine studies which might serve
    as a basis for watercolours, like that very small one of the
    last bathers which I once sent you in a letter. We shall do our
    utmost, but times are hard. What I have just started, what is
    really more necessary than anything else, is painting figure
    studies, but I don't see how I can afford it.</p>

    <p>I have also had the studio altered.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, I have been living on hope for a long
    time.</p>

    <p>But you will come soon - that's a good thing; at all events
    you will see what I still have here then, and you will also see
    that I have not been idle.</p>

    <p>But I must try to get some new strength; if that succeeds,
    it will be high time to use it.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">For my strength is
    failing, it is abnormal for me to get
    tired when I've walked a short distance - e.g. from here to the
    post office - but that is actually the case. Oh, I don't give
    in of course, but I must try to remedy it. Still, my health is
    not thoroughly or chronically upset; it has not been caused by
    excesses, but by too long a period with insufficient and
    unsubstantial food.</label></p>

    <p>Now, what is most pressing this year is the painting. I
    remind you once more of what I already wrote last year, which
    has slipped your mind, I think: here I have to pay the regular
    retail price for colours.</p>

    <p>Wouldn't it be possible for you to get me colours from
    Paillard or someone, in a certain quantity at the wholesale
    price from the manufacturer himself? -Undoubtedly that would be
    a step toward the possibility of the colours not being lacking.
    And I should be very glad if we could arrange it so that you
    deducted 10 francs from your remittance every time. That would
    be 30 francs a month, 90 francs in three months, and I
    shouldn't have to trouble you for a few tubes every now and
    then, but if I had the net price list I could give a
    three-month order. Will you think this over? I think it would
    be a good arrangement. Paillard or Bourgeois or whoever it may
    be, it doesn't matter. As an art dealer, you might perhaps be
    entitled to the wholesale price.</p>

    <p>I had another plan to try to get somebody else to let me
    have colours wholesale, but after talking it over with him, I
    heard he cannot do it.</p>

    <p>You must try to come soon, brother, for I do not know how
    long I shall be able to hold out. Things are getting too much
    for me. I feel my strength failing. I tell you plainly that
    under such circumstances, I am afraid I shall never hold out.
    My constitution would be good enough if I hadn't had to fast so
    long, but it was always a question of fasting or working less,
    and I chose the former as much as possible, till I have become
    too weak now. How to bear up against it? It influences my work
    so obviously and clearly that I don't see the way to get on.
    You must not speak to others about it, brother, for if certain
    persons knew it, they would say, &ldquo;Oh, of course it's what
    we foresaw and prophesied long ago.&rdquo; And not only would
    they not help me, they would cut off all possibility for me
    patiently to regain my strength and to get over it.</p>

    <p>Under the present circumstances, my work cannot be other
    than it is.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">If I can get over my physical weakness, I shall try to make
    progress. Again and again I have put off taking some nourishing
    food because I had to provide for others and for the work. But
    now I am at my wits' end; no progress in my work can be
    expected before I get somewhat stronger. Recently I have seen
    only too clearly that my physical condition influences my work.</label>
    I assure you that it is nothing but prostration from overwork
    and too little nourishment. Some people who have spoken of me
    as if I had some kind of disease would start it again, and that
    is slander of the worst kind; so keep it to yourself without
    speaking about it when you come here. But to a great extent I
    cannot help the dryness in my work, and it will change when I
    can get well again. What I most long for is your coming, so
    that we may look over the work together and see each other
    again.</p>

    <p>Good-by, and meanwhile try to write a little more often, I
    need it so much. And many thanks for this last letter; have a
    good time if possible.</p>

    <p>It will again be a question of fasting these next days till
    your letter arrives. Write as soon as possible.</p>
