  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">It is more than time for you to hear from me again. Thank
    God you are recovering.</label> <label content="feelings.homesick">I am longing so much for Christmas -
    that time will be here perhaps before we know it, though it
    seems long now. </label>Theo, your brother has preached for the first
    time, last Sunday, in God's dwelling, of which is written,
    &ldquo;In this place, I will give peace.&rdquo; Enclosed a copy
    of what I said. May it be the first of many.</p>

    <p>It was a clear autumn day and a beautiful walk from here to
    Richmond along the Thames, in which the great chestnut trees
    with their load of yellow leaves and the clear blue sky were
    mirrored. Through the tops of the trees one could see that part
    of Richmond which lies on the hill: the houses with their red
    roofs, uncurtained windows and green gardens; and the gray
    spire high above them; and below, the long grey bridge with the
    tall poplars on either side, over which the people passed like
    little black figures.<br>
     <label content="feelings.ambition">When I was standing in the pulpit, I felt like somebody who,
    emerging from a dark cave underground, comes back to the
    friendly daylight. It is a delightful thought that in the
    future wherever I go, I shall preach the Gospel; to do that
    sell, one must have the Gospel in one's heart. May the Lord
    give it to me.</label><br>
     You know enough of life, Theo, to understand that a poor
    preacher stands rather alone in the world, but the Lord can
    increasingly rouse in us the consciousness and belief in
    &ldquo;... yet I am not alone, because the Father is with
    me.&rdquo;</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Ik weet aan wien ik mij vertrouwe<br>

    Al wisselen ook dag en nacht,<br>

    Ik ken de rots waarop ik bouwe,<br>

    Hij feilt niet, die mijn heil verwacht.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    [I know to Whom I commit myself;<br>

    Though day and night may alternate,<br>

    I know the rock on which I build;<br>

    He Who awaits my salvation will not fail me.]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">But, boy, how I am
    longing for Christmas and for you all; it
    seems to me I have grown years older in these few months.</label></p>

    <p>Yesterday evening I was again at Richmond, and walked
    through a large grassy field surrounded by trees and houses,
    over which the church spire rises. The dew was lying on the
    grass and the twilight was falling: on one side the sky was
    still aglow from the setting sun, on the other, the moon was
    rising. Under the trees an old lady with beautiful grey hair
    was walking, dressed in black. In the middle of the grass plot
    the boys had lit a bonfire which one could see flickering from
    afar. I thought of the lines: &ldquo;Once at the evening of my
    life, tired from care and strife, I'll bring Thee praise more
    loud and fair, for each day given to me here.&rdquo;<br>
     &agrave; Dieu, a handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Thursday week I hope to preach on John and Theogenes in Mr.
    Jones's church. Your brother was indeed deeply moved when he
    stood at the foot of the pulpit and bowed his head and prayed:
    Abba, Father, in Thy name be our beginning.</p>

    <p>Regards to Mr. and Mrs. Tersteeg and all at Roos's and to
    Van Iterson and to anybody you may see whom I know.</p>

    <p>[Enclosed was Vincent's Sermon, in English, which he gave on
    29 October 1876, and wrote down for Theo]</p>

    <p>Psalm 119: 19. <b>`</b>I am a stranger on the earth, hide
    not Thy commandments from me.'</p>

    <p>It is an old belief and it is a good belief, that our life
    is a pilgrim's progress - that we are strangers on the earth,
    but that though this be so, yet we are not alone for our Father
    is with us. We are pilgrims, our life is a long walk or journey
    from earth to Heaven.</p>

    <p>The beginning of this life is this: there is only one who
    remembereth no more her sorrow and her anguish for joy that a
    man is born into the world. She is our Mother. The end of our
    pilgrimage is the entering in Our Father's house, where are
    many mansions, where He has gone before us to prepare a place
    for us. The end of this life is what we call death - it is an
    hour in which words are spoken, things are seen and felt, that
    are kept in the secret chambers of the hearts of those who
    stand by, - it is so that all of us have such things in our
    hearts or forebodings of such things.</p>

    <p>There is sorrow in the hour when a man is born into the
    world, but also joy, deep and unspeakable, thankfulness so
    great that it reaches the highest heavens. Yes the Angels of
    God, they smile, they hope and they rejoice when a man is born
    in the world. There is sorrow in the hour of death, but there
    is also joy unspeakable when it is the hour of death of one who
    has fought a good fight. There is one who has said: I am the
    resurrection and the life, if any man believe in Me though he
    were dead, yet shall he live. There was an apostle who heard a
    voice from heaven saying: Blessed are they that die in the
    Lord, for they rest from their labour and their works follow
    them.</p>

    <p>There is joy when a man is born in the world, but there is
    greater joy when a spirit has passed through great tribulation,
    when an angel is born in Heaven.</p>

    <p>Sorrow is better than joy - and even in mirth the heart is
    sad - and it is better to go to the house of mourning than to
    the house of feasts, for by the sadness of the countenance the
    heart is made better. Our nature is sorrowful, but for those
    who have learnt and are learning to look at Jesus Christ, there
    is always reason to rejoice.</p>

    <p>It is a good word that of St. Paul: as being sorrowful yet
    always rejoicing. For those who believe in Jesus Christ, there
    is no death or sorrow that is not mixed with hope - no despair
    - there is only a constantly being born again, a constantly
    going from darkness into light. They do not mourn as those who
    have no hope - Christian Faith makes life to evergreen
    life.</p>

    <p>We are pilgrims on the earth and strangers - we come from
    afar and we are going far. The journey of our life goes from
    the loving breast of our Mother on earth to the arms of our
    Father in heaven. Everything on earth changes - we have no
    abiding city here - it is the experience of everybody. That it
    is God's will that we should part with what is dearest on earth
    - we ourselves change in many respects, we are not what we once
    were, we shall not remain what we are now. From infancy we grow
    up to boys and girls - young men and women - and if God spares
    us and helps us, to husbands and wives, Fathers and Mothers in
    our turn, and then, slowly but surely the face that once had
    the early dew of morning, gets its wrinkles, the eyes that once
    beamed with youth and gladness speak of a sincere deep and
    earnest sadness, though they may keep the fire of Faith, Hope
    and Charity - though they may beam with God's spirit. The hair
    turns grey or we lose it-ah-indeed we only pass through the
    earth, we only pass through life, we are strangers and pilgrims
    on the earth. The world passes and all its glory. Let our later
    days be nearer to Thee, and therefore better than these.</p>

    <p>Yet we may not live on casually hour by hour - no we have a
    strife to strive and a fight to fight. What is it we must do:
    we must love God with all our strength, with all our might,
    with all our soul, we must love our neighbours as ourselves.
    These two commandments we must keep, and if we follow after
    these, if we are devoted to this, we are not alone, for our
    Father in Heaven is with us, helps us and guides us, gives us
    strength day by day, hour by hour, and so we can do all things
    through Christ who gives us might.</p>

    <p>We are strangers on the earth, hide not Thy commandments
    from us. Open Thou our eyes that we may behold wondrous things
    out of Thy law. Teach us to do Thy will and influence our
    hearts that the love of Christ may constrain us and that we may
    be brought to do what we must do to be saved.</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    On the road from earth to Heaven<br>

    Do Thou guide us with Thine eye;<br>

    We are weak but Thou art mighty,<br>

    Hold us with Thy powerful hand.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>Our life, we might compare it with a journey, we go from the
    place where we were born to a far-off haven. Our earlier life
    might be compared to sailing on a river, but very soon the
    waves become higher, the wind more violent, we are at sea
    almost before we are aware of it - and the prayer from the
    heart ariseth to God: Protect me 0 God, for my bark is so small
    and Thy sea is so great. The heart of man is very much like the
    sea, it has its storms, its tides and its depths; it has its
    pearls too. The heart that seeks for God and for a Godly life
    has more storms than any other. Let us see how a Psalmist
    describes a storm at sea. He must have felt the storm in his
    heart to describe it so. We read in the io<sub>7</sub>th Psalm:
    They that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great
    waters, these see the works of the Lord and His wonders in the
    deep. For He commandeth and raiseth up a stormy wind, which
    lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to Heaven, they go
    down again to the depth, their soul melteth in them because of
    their trouble. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble,
    and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He bringeth them
    into their desired haven.</p>

    <p>Do we not feel this sometimes on the sea of our lives? Does
    not every one of you feel with me the storms of life or their
    forebodings or their recollections?</p>

    <p>And now let us read a description of another storm at sea in
    the New Testa-ment, as we find it in the Vith chapter of the
    Gospel according to St. John in the 17<sup>th</sup> to the
    21<sup>st</sup> verse. &ldquo;And the disciples entered into a
    ship and went over the sea towards Capernaum. And the sea arose
    by reason of a great wind that blew. So when they had rowed
    about five-and-twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus
    walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were
    afraid. Then they willingly received Him into the ship and
    immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.&rdquo;
    You who have experienced the great storms of life, you over
    whom all the waves and all the billows of the Lord have gone -
    have you not heard, when your heart failed for fear, the
    beloved well-known voice with something in its tone that
    reminded you of the voice that charmed your childhood - the
    voice of Him whose name is Saviour and Prince of Peace, saying
    as it were to you personally, mind to you personally: &ldquo;It
    is I, be not afraid.&rdquo; Fear not. Let not your heart be
    troubled.</p>

    <p>And we whose lives have been calm up till now, calm in
    comparison of what others have felt - let us not fear the
    storms of life, amidst the high waves of the sea and under the
    grey clouds of the sky we shall see Him approaching, for whom
    we have so often longed and watched, Him we need so - and we
    shall hear His voice: It is I, be not afraid.</p>

    <p>And if after an hour or season of anguish or distress or
    great difficulty or pain or sorrow we hear Him ask us:
    &ldquo;Dost thou love me?&rdquo; Then let us say: Lord Thou
    knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love Thee. And let us
    keep that heart full of the love of Christ and may from thence
    issue a life which the love of Christ constraineth, Lord Thou
    knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love Thee; when we look
    back on our past we feel sometimes as if we did love Thee, for
    whatsoever we have loved, we loved in Thy name.</p>

    <p>Have we not often felt as a widow and an orphan - in joy and
    prosperity as well and even more than under grief - because of
    the thought of Thee. Truly our soul waiteth for Thee more than
    they that watch for the morning, our eyes are up unto Thee, 0
    Thou who dwellest in Heaven. In our days too there can be such
    a thing as seeking the Lord.</p>

    <p>What is it we ask of God - is it a great thing? Yes, it is a
    great thing, peace for the ground of our heart, rest for our
    soul - give us that one thing and then we want not much more,
    then we can do without many things, then can we suffer great
    things for Thy name's sake. We want to know that we are Thine
    and that Thou art ours, we want to be Thine - to be Christians
    - we want a Father, a Father's love and a Father's approval.
    May the experience of life make our eye single and fix it on
    Thee. May we grow better as we go on in life. We have spoken of
    the storms on the journey of life</p>

    <p>But now let us speak of the calms and joys of Christian
    life. And yet, my dear friends, let us rather cling to the
    seasons of difficulty and work and sorrow, for the calms are
    often treacherous. The heart has its storms, has its seasons of
    drooping but also its calms and even its times of exaltation.
    There is a time of sighing and of praying, but there is also a
    time of answer to prayer. Weeping may endure for a night but
    joy cometh in the morning.</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    The heart that is fainting<br>

    May grow full to overflowing<br>

    And they that behold it<br>

    Shall wonder and know not<br>

    That God at its fountains<br>

    Far off has been raining.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>My peace I leave with you - we saw how there is peace even
    in the storm. Thanks be to God, who has given us to be born and
    to live in a Christian country. Has any one of us forgotten the
    golden hours of our early days at home, and since we left that
    home - for many of us have had to leave that home and to earn
    their living and to make their way in the world. Has He not
    brought us thus far, have we lacked anything, Lord we believe
    help Thou our unbelief. I still feel the rapture, the thrill of
    joy I felt when for the first time I cast a deep look in the
    lives of my Parents, when I felt by instinct how much they were
    Christians. And I still feel that feeling of eternal youth and
    enthusiasm wherewith I went to God, saying: &ldquo;I will be a
    Christian too.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Are we what we dreamt we should be? No, but still the
    sorrows of life, the multitude of things of daily life and of
    daily duties, so much more numerous than we expected, the
    tossing to and fro in the world, they have covered it over, but
    it is not dead, it sleepeth. The old eternal faith and love of
    Christ, it may sleep in us but it is not dead and God can
    revive it in us. But though to be born again to eternal life,
    to the life of Faith, Hope and Charity, - and to an evergreen
    life - to the life of a Christian and a Christian workman, be a
    gift of God, a work of God - and of God alone, yet let us put
    the hand to the plough on the field of our heart, let us cast
    out our net once more - let us try once more. God knows the
    intention of the spirit. God knows us better than we know
    ourselves, for He made us and not we ourselves. He knows of
    what things we have need. He knows what is good for us. May He
    give us His blessing on the seed of His word, that He has sown
    in our hearts.</p>

    <p>God helping us, we shall get through life. With every
    temptation he will give a way to escape.</p>

    <p>Father we pray Thee not that Thou shouldest take us out of
    the world, but we pray Thee to keep us from evil. Give us
    neither poverty nor riches, feed us with bread convenient for
    us. And let Thy songs be our delight in the houses of our
    pilgrimage. God of our Fathers be our God: may their people be
    our people, their faith our faith. We are strangers on the
    earth, hide not Thy com-mandments from us, but may the love of
    Christ constrain us. Entreat us not to leave Thee or refrain
    from following after Thee. Thy people shall be our people. Thou
    shalt be our God.</p>

    <p>Our life is a pilgrim's progress. I once saw a very
    beautiful picture: it was a landscape at evening. In the
    distance on the right-hand side a row of hills appeared blue in
    the evening mist. Above those hills the splendour of the
    sunset, the grey clouds with their linings of silver and gold
    and purple. The landscape is a plain or heath covered with
    grass and its yellow leaves, for it was in autumn. Through the
    landscape a road leads to a high mountain far, far away, on the
    top of that mountain is a city wherein the setting sun casts a
    glory. On the road walks a pilgrim, staff in hand. He has been
    walking for a good long while already and he is very tired. And
    now he meets a woman, or figure in black, that makes one think
    of St. Paul's word: As being sorrowful yet always rejoicing.
    That Angel of God has been placed there to encourage the
    pilgrims and to answer their questions.</p>

    <p>And the pilgrim asks her: Does the road go uphill then all
    the way?&rdquo; And the answer is: &ldquo;Yes to the very
    end.&rdquo; And he asks again: &ldquo;And will the journey take
    all day long?&rdquo; And the answer is: &ldquo;From morn till
    night my friend.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And the pilgrim goes on sorrowful yet always rejoicing -
    sorrowful because it is so far off and the road so long.
    Hopeful as he looks up to the eternal city far away,
    resplendent in the evening glow and he thinks of two old
    sayings that he heard long ago - the one is:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Much strife must be striven</p>

    <p>Much suffering must be suffered</p>

    <p>Much prayer must be prayed</p>

    <p>And then the end will be peace.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And the other is</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The water comes up to the lips</p>

    <p>But higher comes it not.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And he says: I shall be more and more tired but also nearer
    and nearer to Thee. Has not man a strife on earth? But there is
    a consolation from God in this life. An Angel of God comforting
    man - that is the Angel of Charity. Let us not forget her. And
    when each of us goes back to the daily things and daily duties
    let us not forget that things are not what they seem, that God
    by the things of daily life teacheth us higher things, that our
    life is a pilgrim's progress, and that we are strangers on the
    earth, but that we have a God and father who preserveth
    strangers, - and that we are all brethren.</p>

    <p>Amen.</p>

    <p>And now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of
    God the Father and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us
    forever more.</p>

    <p>Amen.</p>

    <p>(Reading: Psalm 91.)</p>

    <p>Once more, a handshake in my thoughts. Yesterday evening I
    went to Turnham Common to take the service for Mr. Jones, who
    was not well. I walked there with the oldest of the boys, he is
    17 but as tall as I am and has a beard. He is due to go into
    business later, his father has a large factory. He has an
    honest, good, sensitive heart and a great need of religion. His
    hope and desire are to do good among the working people when he
    is older. I recommended Eliot's Felix Holt to him.</p>

    <p>It was beautiful in the park with the old elm trees I the
    moonlight and the dew on the grass. It felt so good speaking in
    the little church - it is a wooden church.</p>

    <p>Bye, Theo, bye, my boy. I hope I have written this so you
    are able to read it. Keep your spirits up and get better
    soon.</p>
