  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and the enclosure. I think the news
    about your patient is very favourable. Congratulations, the
    recovery from that anemia is decidedly a result of renewed hope
    and vitality, brought about by sympathy and kindness.</p>

	<blockquote><blockquote>

    And they who behold it<br>

    Shall wonder and know not<br>

    That God at its fountains<br>

    Far off has been raining.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>Now you will already have received - at least I sent it
    yesterday afternoon - a very rough sketch of a watercolour.</p>

    <p>This, in answer to your question about that.</p>

    <p>It was not done recently, however. I started it a few months
    ago, and have occasionally given it a few touches since then.
    But it is still crude. Since then, I have made a large number
    of studies - that is, drawings of the figure, and especially of
    heads - with just such a scene in mind as this sketch
    represents; it must be finished by adding character and relief,
    especially to the beads, hands and feet. I am sending them to
    you because you will see in them more clearly than in many
    other watercolours I have done till now that I have a keen eye
    for striking colours - that I see them fresh, through a grey
    haze. However unfinished and imperfect it may be, this is part
    of a street chosen at random and done in the way in which I
    want to represent the Geest or the Jewish quarter. This sketch
    was no accident: I can take all kinds of scenes I see this far,
    getting the same relatively strong effects of colour and tone.
    Now if you compare this drawing with the <i>lithographs</i> and
    <i>drawings of heads</i> I sent you this winter, you can see my
    intentions clearly from those various <i>failures</i>.</p>

    <p>The large studies of heads, for instance, of which I have
    still many others - for instance, with sou'westers, with shawls
    and white bonnets and top hats and caps - must serve for
    compositions such as the one I am sending you this time.</p>

    <p>But I shall have to put up with many more failures, for I
    believe that in watercolour much depends on a great dexterity
    and quickness of touch. One must work in it before it is dry to
    get harmony, and one hasn't much time for reflection then. So
    the principal thing is not finishing each one separately, no,
    one must put down those twenty or thirty heads rapidly, one
    after the other.</p>

    <p>Here follow a few curious sayings about water colours:
    &ldquo;L'aquarelle est quelque chose de diabolique&rdquo;; and
    the other is by Whistler, who said, &ldquo;Yes, I did that in
    two hours, but I studied for years to be able to accomplish
    this in two hours.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Enough of this; I love watercolour too much ever to give it
    up entirely, I come back to it again and again. But the
    foundation of everything is the knowledge of the figure, so
    that one can readily draw men and women and children whatever
    they are doing. So this is my chief aim, which cannot be
    realized in any other way, I think.</p>

    <p>And I try to work myself up to a higher level of knowledge
    and ability in general, rather than to care very much about
    finishing off some particular sketch. After having drawn for a
    month, I now and then make a few watercolours, for instance, by
    way of casting the plummet to fathom my depth. Each time I see
    that I have overcome some obstacles, but that new difficulties
    have arisen. Then I start drudging again to conquer those.</p>

    <p>As for the colours, they are really all used up - and not
    only that, but because of some relatively heavy expenses, I am
    not only hard up, but absolutely penniless.</p>

    <p>Spring is coming, and I should like to take up painting
    again, too. So that is partly the reason why I am not working
    in watercolour right now.</p>

    <p>But indirectly I am always working at it, and now that I can
    study the effects of chiaroscuro better because of the
    alterations in the studio, I shall work more and more with the
    brush, even in Black and White drawings, and wash the shadows
    in with neutral tint, sepia, India ink, Cassel earth, and
    accentuate the lights with Chinese white.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Do you remember that last summer you brought me pieces of
    mountain crayon? I tried to work with it at the time, but it
    didn't work well. So a few pieces were left, which I picked up
    the other day; enclosed you'll find a scratch done with it; you
    see it is a peculiar, warm black. You would greatly oblige me
    by bringing some more of it this summer. It has a great
    advantage - the big pieces are much easier to handle while
    sketching than a thin stick of cont&eacute;, which is hard to
    hold and which breaks all the time. So for sketching outdoors,
    it is delightful.</label></p>

    <p>Well, boy - it is difficult to write it all, and I wanted to
    answer your question about watercolour in more than words. I
    should not want anybody to see just this one sketch of mine,
    because I myself think nothing is right in this sketch except
    the general aspect, and I will wrestle with the figures till I
    get in watercolour what they are beginning to get in
    lithography - that is, more character and effect.</p>

    <p>It is not pleasant to make sketches like the one I sent you,
    and then not to be able to finish them; I hate this so much
    that I rarely make them, except as a trial to see if I have
    made any progress. But now I have new courage and interest,
    just because I have been making a great many studies again.</p>

    <p>I think the change in the studio will help me on, not the
    first day, but after a few months' struggling.</p>

    <p><?showImage("317_V-T_2700");?>
     I can now do part of my work perfectly well at home, studying
    with models, such effects as the watercolour I sent you.</p>

    <p>Here the windows are closed at the bottom so that the light
    on the group of figures falls from above. In this way I can
    group them in the studio, and then I get, for instance, the
    highlights on the heads of the figures.</p>

    <p>Like in this watercolour.</p>

    <p>I have tried it already with the old man, the woman and the
    children - it gives <i>splendid</i> effects. The desire to make
    them is not wanting, but I expect new failures - which I hope,
    however will have <i>something</i> in them to encourage rather
    than to make one lose courage though they are failures.</p>

    <p>I had to pay for so many things at once out of the money you
    sent that I wish you could send some more but arrange it as
    best you can - I have so much work now that I can vary it just
    as I like. I long very much for your coming, just to show you
    the studies and to talk about the work.</p>

    <p>Adieu, thanks again. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
