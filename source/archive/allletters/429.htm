  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I read your letter about black with great pleasure, and it
    convinces me that you have no prejudice against black.</p>

    <p>Your description of Manet's study, &ldquo;The Dead
    Toreador,&rdquo; was well analyzed. And the whole letter proves
    the same as your sketch of Paris suggested to me at the time,
    that if you put yourself to it, you can paint a thing in
    words.</p>

    <p>It is a fact that by studying the laws of the colours, one
    can move from instinctive belief in the great masters to the
    analysis of why one admires - what one admires - and that
    indeed is necessary nowadays, when one realizes how terribly
    arbitrary and superficially people criticize.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">You must just let me maintain my pessimism about the art
    trade as it is these days, for it does not at all include
    discouragement. This is my way of reasoning. Supposing I am
    right in considering that curious haggling about prices of
    pictures to be more and more like the bulb trade. I repeat,
    supposing that like the bulb trade at the end of the last
    century, so the art trade, along with other branches of
    speculation at the end of this century, will disappear as they
    came, namely rather quickly. The bulb trade may disappear - the
    flower-growing remains. And I for myself am contented, for
    better or for worse, to be a small gardener, who loves his
    plants.</label></p>

    <p>Just now my palette is thawing and the frigidness of the
    first beginning has disappeared.</p>

    <p>It is true, I often blunder still when I undertake a thing,
    but the colours follow of their own accord, and taking one
    colour as a starting-point, I have clearly before my mind what
    must follow, and how to get life into it.</p>

    <p>Jules Dupr&eacute; is in landscape rather like Delacroix,
    for what enormous variety of mood did he express in symphonies
    of colour.</p>

    <p>Now a marine, with the most delicate blue-greens and broken
    blue and all kinds of pearly tones, then again an autumn
    landscape, with a foliage from deep wine-red to vivid green,
    from bright orange to dark havana, with other colours again in
    the sky, in greys, lilacs, blues, whites, forming a further
    contrast with the yellow leaves.</p>

    <p>Then again a sunset in black, in violet, in fiery red.</p>

    <p>Then again, more fantastic, what I once saw, a corner of a
    garden by him, which I have never forgotten: black in the
    shadow, white in the sun, vivid green, a fiery red and then
    again a dark blue, a bituminous greenish brown, and a light
    brown-yellow. Colours that indeed have something to say for
    themselves.</p>

    <p>I have always been very fond of Jules Dupr&eacute;, and he
    will become still more appreciated than he is. For he is a real
    colourist, always interesting, and so powerful and
    dramatic.</p>

    <p>Yes, he is indeed a brother to Delacroix.</p>

    <p>As I told you, I think your letter about black very good,
    and what you say about not painting local colour is also quite
    correct. But it doesn't satisfy me. In my opinion there is much
    more behind that not painting local colour.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Les vrais peintres sont ceux qui ne font pas la
    couleur locale&rdquo; [The true painters are those who do not
    render local colour] - that was what Blanc and Delacroix
    discussed once.</p>

    <p>May I not boldly take it to mean that a painter does better
    to start from the colours on his palette than from the colours
    in nature? I mean, when one wants to paint, for instance, a
    head, and sharply observes the reality one has before one, then
    one may think: that head is a harmony of red-brown, violet,
    yellow, all of them broken - I will put a violet and a yellow
    and a red-brown on my palette and these will break each
    other.</p>

    <p>I retain from nature a certain sequence and a certain
    correctness in placing the tones, I study nature, so as not to
    do foolish things, to remain reasonable - however, I don't mind
    so much whether my colour corresponds exactly, as long as it
    looks beautiful on my canvas, as beautiful as it looks in
    nature.</p>

    <p>Far more true is a portrait by Courbet, manly, free, painted
    in all kinds of beautiful deep tones of red-brown, of gold, of
    colder violet in the shadow with black as repoussoir, with a
    little bit of tinted white linen as a repose to the eye - finer
    than a portrait by whomever you like, who has imitated the
    colour of the face with horribly close precision.</p>

    <p>A man's head or a woman's head, well contemplated and at
    leisure, is divinely beautiful, isn't it? Well, that <i>general
    har-mony</i> of tones in nature, one loses it by painfully
    exact imitation, one keeps it by recreating in an equivalent
    colour range, that may be not exactly or far from exactly like
    the model.</p>

    <p>Always and intelligently to make use of the beautiful tones
    which the colours form of their own accord, when one breaks
    them on the palette, I repeat - to start from one's palette,
    from one's knowledge of colour-harmony, is quite different from
    following nature mechanically and obsequiously.</p>

    <p>Here is another example: suppose I have to paint an autumn
    landscape, trees with yellow leaves. All right - when I
    conceive it as a symphony in yellow, what does it matter
    whether the fundamental colour of yellow is the same as that of
    the leaves or not? It matters <i>very little</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Much, everything</i> depends on my perception of the
    infinite variety of tones of one and the <i>same
    family</i>.</p>

    <p>Do you call this a dangerous inclination towards
    romanticism, an infidelity to &ldquo;realism,&rdquo; a
    &ldquo;peindre de chic,&rdquo; [painting without copying
    reality] a caring more for the palette of the colourist than
    for nature? Well, que soit. Delacroix, Millet, Corot,
    Dupr&eacute;, Daubigny, Breton, thirty names more, are they not
    the heart and soul of the art of painting of this century, and
    are they not all rooted in romanticism, though they
    <i>surpassed</i> romanticism?</p>

    <p>Romance and romanticism are of our time, and painters must
    have imagination and sentiment. Luckily realism and naturalism
    are not free from it. Zola creates, but does not hold up a
    <i>mirror</i> to things, he creates <i>wonderfully</i>, but
    <i>creates, poetises</i>, that is why it is so beautiful. So
    much for naturalism and realism, which nonetheless stand in
    connection to romanticism.</p>

    <p>And I repeat that I am touched when I see a picture of about
    the years '30-'48, a Paul Huet, an old Isra&euml;ls, like the
    &ldquo;Fisherman of Zandvoort,&rdquo; a Cabat, an Isabey.</p>

    <p>But I find so much truth in that saying: &ldquo;ne pas
    peindre le ton local,&rdquo; [do not paint local tone] that I
    far prefer a picture in a lower tonal scale than nature to one
    which is exactly like nature.</p>

    <p>Rather a watercolour that is somewhat vague and unfinished
    than one which is worked up to simulate reality.</p>

    <p>That saying: &ldquo;ne pas peindre le ton local,&rdquo; has
    a broad meaning, and it leaves the painter free to seek for
    colours which form a whole and harmonize, which stand out the
    more in contrast to another combination.</p>

    <p>What do I care whether the portrait of an honourable citizen
    tells me exactly the milk-and-watery bluish, insipid colour of
    that pious man's face - which I would never have noticed. But
    the citizens of the small town, where the above-mentioned
    individual has rendered himself so meritorious that he thought
    himself obliged to impress his physiognomy on posterity, are
    highly edified by the correct exactness.</p>

    <p><i>Colour expresses something by itself</i> one cannot do
    without this, one must use it; that which is beautiful, really
    beautiful - is also correct; when Veronese had painted the
    portraits of his beau-monde in the &ldquo;Marriage at
    Cana,&rdquo; he had spent on it all the richness of his palette
    in sombre violets, in splendid golden tones. Then - he thought
    still of a faint azure and a pearly-white - which does not
    appear in the foreground. He detonated it on in the background
    - and it was right, spontaneously it changes into the ambience
    of marble palaces and sky, which characteristically consummates
    the ordering of the figures.</p>

    <p>So beautiful is that background that it arose spontaneously
    from a calculation of colours. Am I wrong in this?</p>

    <p>Is it not painted <i>differently</i> than somebody would do
    it who had thought at the same time of the palace and of the
    figures as one whole?</p>

    <p>All that architecture and sky is conventional and
    subordinate to the figures, it is calculated to make the
    figures stand out beautifully.</p>

    <p>Surely <i>that is</i> real painting, and the result is more
    beautiful than the exact imitation of the things themselves. To
    think of one thing and to let the surroundings belong to it and
    proceed from it.</p>

    <p>To study from nature, to wrestle with reality - I don't want
    to do away with it, for years and years I myself have been so
    engaged, almost fruitlessly and with all kinds of sad
    results.</p>

    <p>I should not like to have missed that <i>error</i>.</p>

    <p>I mean that it would be foolish and stupid always to go on
    in that same way, but <i>not</i> that all the pains I took
    should be absolutely dismissed.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;On commence par tuer, on finit par guerir,&rdquo;
    [One begins by killing, one ends by healing] is a doctor's
    saying. One starts with a hopeless struggle to follow nature,
    and everything goes wrong; one ends by calmly creating from
    one's palette, and nature agrees with it, and follows. But
    these two contrasts are not separable from one another. The
    drudging, though it may seem in vain, gives an intimacy with
    nature, a sounder knowledge of things. And a beautiful saying
    by Dor&eacute; (who sometimes is so clever) is: <i>je me
    souviens</i>. [I remember.] Though I believe that the best
    pictures are more or less freely painted by heart, still I
    <i>cannot</i> divorce the principle that one can never study
    and toil too much from nature. The greatest, most powerful
    imaginations have at the same time made things directly from
    nature which strike one dumb.</p>

    <p>In answer to your description of the study by Manet, I send
    you <art id=0117>a still-life of an open - so a broken white - Bible bound
    in leather, against a black background, with a yellow-brown
    foreground, with a touch of citron yellow.</art></p>

    <p>I painted that in <i>one rush</i>, during a single day.</p>

    <p>This to show you that when I say that I have perhaps not
    plodded completely in vain, I dare say this, because at present
    it comes quite easily to me to paint a given subject
    unhesitatingly, whatever its form or colour may be. Recently I
    painted a few studies out of doors, of the autumn landscape. I
    shall write again soon, and send this letter in haste to tell
    you that I was quite pleased with what you say about black.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
