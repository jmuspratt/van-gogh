    <p>Sunday night</p>

    <p>The Hague, 22 July 1883</p>

    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">It may be
    feverishness, or nerves, or something else, I
    don't know, but I don't feel well. Perhaps I am thinking more
    than is necessary about that expression in your letter
    concerning various things; I hope so. And I have an uneasy
    feeling I can't shake off, though I have tried to overcome
    it.</label></p>

    <p>There isn't any reason for it, is there? If there is
    anything, then tell me straight out what kind of obstacles
    there are.</p>

    <p>At all events, write too, by return of mail if possible,
    whether there is anything or not. I can't help it if there is
    no reason for it, but all at once I'm in the dumps. It may be a
    reaction from my overexerting myself.</p>

    <p>At all events, write soon, boy; did you get the photographs?
    I'm going to take a long walk to try to shake it off.
    Adieu,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.loneliness">In fact, I have no
    real friend but you, and when I am in low
    spirits, I always think of you. I only wish you were here, that
    we might again talk together about moving to the country.</label></p>

    <p>Except for what I told you about, there is nothing the
    matter with me, and things are going well - but perhaps I am a
    little feverish or something - I feel miserable. I had to pay
    money right and left - landlord, paint, baker, grocer,
    shoemaker, heaven knows what - and only a little is left But
    the worst is that after many such weeks, one feels one's
    resistance ebbing, and is overcome by a pervading feeling of
    weariness.</p>

    <p>If you can't send anything at once, brother, at all events
    try to write me by return of mail if possible. And as to the
    future, if there is some danger, tell it straight out,
    &ldquo;homme avis&eacute; en vaut deux,&rdquo; it is better to
    know exactly what one has to fight against.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">I have tried
    to work a little today, but suddenly I was
    overcome by a depression which I cannot exactly account for. At
    such moments one wishes one were made of iron, and regrets that
    one is only flesh and blood.</label></p>

    <p>I had written you early this morning, but after I had mailed
    my letter, it suddenly seemed as if all my troubles crowded
    together to overwhelm me, and it became too much for me because
    I could no longer look clearly into the future. I can't put it
    any other way, and I can't understand why I shouldn't succeed
    in my work.</p>

    <p>I have put all my heart into it, and, for a moment at least,
    that seemed to me a mistake.</p>

    <p>But, boy, you know it yourself - what things in practical
    life must one devote one's strength and thought and energy to?
    One must take a chance and say, I will do a certain thing and
    carry it through. Well, then it may turn out wrong, and one may
    hit an impenetrable barrier when people do not care for it; but
    one needn't care after all, need one? I don't think one has to
    worry over it; but sometimes it becomes too hard, and one feels
    miserable against one's will.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">And now I thought,
    I am sorry that I didn't fall ill and die
    in the Borinage that time, instead of taking up painting, for I
    am only a burden to you. And yet I cannot help it, for one must
    go through many phases to become a good painter, and what one
    makes in the meantime is not exactly bad if one tries one's
    utmost; but there ought to be people who see it in the light of
    its tendency and objective, and who do not ask the
    impossible.</p>

    <p>Things are looking dark right now. If it were only for me,
    but there is the thought of the woman and the children, poor
    creatures whom one would keep safe, and feels responsible
    for.</label></p>

    <p>The woman has been doing well recently.</p>

    <p>I cannot talk about it with them, but for myself it became
    too much today. Work is the only remedy; if that does not help,
    one breaks down.</p>

    <p>And you see the trouble is that the possibility of working
    depends on selling the work, for there are expenses - the more
    one works, the greater the expenses are (though the latter is
    not true in every respect). When one does not sell and has no
    other income, it is impossible to make the progress which would
    otherwise follow of its own accord.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">The fact is, brother,
    that the general state of affairs
    oppressed me more than I could bear, and I am telling you my
    thoughts. I only wish you would come soon. And do write soon,
    for I need it. Of course there is nobody but you whom I can
    speak to about it, for it does not concern other people, and
    they have nothing to do with it.</label></p>
