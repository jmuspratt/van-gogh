  <body>
    <p>Dear Sir,</p>
    <p>You will doubtlessly have understood that my last letter had crossed itself with yours.
    I have here in my hand the one that you wrote on the 16th and, after having paid a visit
    to your brother, I will give you his news.</p>

    <p>I will hasten to tell you that, to my great surprise, I found him reasoning perfectly
    and having full understanding of his condition. On entering the hospice the porter handed
    me a letter he had just received for him, and which I recognised as coming from you. He
    thought that your brother would not be in a state to understand it. But I had hardly entered
    his room when, noticing the considerable improvement in him, I did not hesitate to give it
    to him. He read it in my presence, and even communicated to me the last part of it, where
    you speak to him of a friend, a fellow painter, who wants to come to Arles.</p>

    <p>Your brother has spoken to me with calm and perfect lucidity about his situation, and also
    of the petition signed by his neighbors, the existence of which which the commissioner cannot
    ignore. This piece distresses him a great deal. If the police, he said to me, protected my
    liberty by preventing the children and even the grown-ups from gathering around my domicile
    and climbing up the windows as they did (as if I was a curious beast), I would have remained
    calmer; in any case I haven't hurt anybody and I am not dangerous to anyone.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">He understands, that goes without saying, that he has had a
    bout of insanity and this thought grieves and revolts him at the same
    time.</label> I told him that, once he is completely recovered, he must agree that it
    would be in his best interest and in view of his peace of mind to
    move to another quarter. He appears to have accepted this idea,
    while calling my attention to the fact that perhaps it would be
    difficult to find an apartment elsewhere after what has
    happened.</p>

    <p>In summary, I have found your brother transformed and, God
    willing, this improvement will be maintained.</p>

    <p>There is something in his state which is indefinable, and it
    is impossible to account for the so abrupt and sudden changes that have happened to him.
    It is evident that while he remains in the situation where I have seen him, there is no
    question that he will remain confined; no one that I know has this
    sad courage.</p>

    <p>He told me that he will hasten to write to you.</p>

    <p>The best to you, and from the bottom of my heart.</p>

    <p>Your very devoted, Salles.</p>
