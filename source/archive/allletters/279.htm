  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and the enclosed 50 fr., which were
    as welcome as ever, the former as well as the latter. <label content="Theo.mistress">I read
    with interest what you wrote about your patient. The change in
    circumstances brought about by her recovery has a more or less
    critical side, because probably, and you expect it yourself, it
    will raise opposition in some minds - but let's hope it won't.</label>
    How strange it is that it must be so. We ourselves see such a
    thing as very simple and natural - something logical - and then
    we are more or less astonished because others cannot find in
    themselves the motives which make us act as we do. And one
    would almost conclude that some people have cauterized certain
    sensitive nerves within themselves - especially those which,
    combined, are called conscience. Well, I pity them - in my
    opinion they travel through life without a compass. One might
    suppose that the love for humanity which is the foundation of
    everything should be in every human being. But some pretend
    that thee are better foundations. I'm not very curious to know
    them; since the old one has proved to be the right one for so
    many ages, it is sufficient for me. Don't you like this little
    poem - it is from Les Mis&eacute;rables:</p>

	<blockquote><blockquote>
    Si C&eacute;sar m'avait donn&eacute;<br>

    La gloire et la guerre,<br>

    Et qu'il me fall&ucirc;t quitter<br>

    L'amour de ma m&egrave;re,<br>

    Je dirais au grand C&eacute;sar:<br>

    Reprends ton sceptre et ton char,<br>

    J'aime mieux ma m&egrave;re, o h&eacute;,<br>

    J'aime mieux ma m&egrave;re.<br>

	</blockquote></blockquote>
    <p>[If Caesar had given me/ glory and war,/ and if I had to
    leave/ the love of my mother,/ I should say to great Caesar:/
    take back your sceptre and your triumphal car,/ I love my
    mother more.]</p>

    <p>In the context in which it appeared in the book (it is a
    student's song of the time of the Revolution of '30), the
    &ldquo;love for my mother&rdquo; stands for the love for the
    republic, or rather love for humanity, in other words, simply
    universal brotherhood.</p>

    <p>It is my opinion that no matter how good and noble a woman
    may be by nature, if she has no means and is not protected by
    her own family, in the present society she is in great,
    immediate danger of being drowned in the pool of prostitution.
    What is more natural than protecting such a woman, and, if it
    can be done in no other way, if circumstances lead to it, if il
    faut y mettre sa peau - marrying her?</p>

    <p>At least I think one must, on principle, continue that
    protection until she is definitely safe, and shield her with
    one's own breast, as it were. Even without real love?</p>

    <p>Perhaps so - then maybe it is a marriage de raison, but not
    in the sense of a marriage for selfish reasons.</p>

    <p>And further, your particular case is different from the more
    commonplace ones like mine, for instance, because the person in
    question possesses a special charm and, as I see it, sympathy
    of feeling; as a consequence, the possibility of an inner
    struggle about the problem you mention would also have emerged,
    even if the meeting had taken place under quite different and
    less dramatic circumstances.</p>

    <p>You will find my thoughts on the question, &ldquo;How far
    may one go in helping an unfortunate woman?&rdquo; in what I
    have said. The answer is, Indefinitely. However, granting that
    in love the first and principal thing is to be faithful, I
    remind you of your own saying, &ldquo;Marriage (that is, civil
    marriage) is such a queer thing.&rdquo; This saying of yours
    describes it exactly, and on that point I declare I do not know
    which is better or worse, to reject it or not. It is what they
    call puzzling, it puzzles me, too, and I wish one could leave
    it alone altogether. I think the saying is true, &ldquo;If one
    marries, one doesn't marry only the woman herself, but the
    whole family in the bargain&rdquo; - which is sometimes awkward
    and miserable enough when they are a bad lot.</p>

    <p>But now about the drawings.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I have again done a few with printer's ink, and this week I
    made some experiments in mixing that printer's ink with white.
    I found out that it can be mixed in two ways - that is, with
    the white from the tubes of oil paint and, probably even
    better, with the ordinary powdered zinc white which can be
    obtained at any drugstore; it must be diluted with turpentine,
    which doesn't soak into this paper or cause spots on the back
    like oil does, because it dries quickly and disappears.</label></p>

    <p>One gets much stronger effects working with printer's ink
    than with ordinary ink.</p>

    <p>How beautiful Jules Dupr&eacute;'s work is. In Goupil's show
    window I saw a small marine which you are sure to know. I went
    to look at it nearly every evening. But you are perhaps
    somewhat blas&eacute; about Dupr&eacute; and similar works of
    art, which one sees so much more in Paris than here; you do not
    know what a beautiful impression it makes here, where one sees
    so very little of it.</p>

    <p>I am reading the last part of Les Mis&eacute;rables; the
    figure of Fantine, a prostitute, made a deep impression on me -
    oh, I know just as well as everybody else that one will not
    find an exact Fantine in reality, but this character of Hugo's
    is true - as, indeed, are all his characters, being the essence
    of what one sees in reality.</p>

    <p>It is the type - of which one only meets individuals.</p>

    <p>If you meet, one of these days, an engraver like, for
    instance, Girardet or Eichens, who make aquatints, you would do
    me a great favour if you just asked him how the drawings which
    serve as a guide for the engraving are usually made. Perhaps
    they will answer, with printer's ink; if this is right, what do
    they dilute the printer's ink with, how do they use it?</p>

    <p>It seems to me that if you spoke to some engraver casually
    about it, and repeated what he said to me, I might find
    something in it which would shed light on some questions, even
    though it contained no direct information about how the
    printer's ink is diluted so that one can work with it in
    different ways <i>on paper</i>.</p>

    <p>There certainly is some kind of printer's ink other than the
    one I am using right now, and gradually I shall find out many
    things for myself. When one works with printer's ink and
    turpentine, as I do now, the drawings get effects like those in
    aquatint engravings. At one time I saw drawings, for instance,
    by Mottramb, the English engraver who has engraved Boughton's
    pictures, and I wish I knew what materials he worked with.</p>

    <p>Of course I'm in no hurry for this information, only when
    you hear something about different drawing techniques, be sure
    to tell me.</p>

    <p>I remember Soek's wife and her mother [acquaintances of
    Vincent and Theo in Paris, with whom Theo's patient went to
    live] quite well (if she still lives with her), and used to
    visit their house; and I think them two sympathetic persons who
    remind me of those of my own household, so much so that I often
    think of them as if they were of the same family. They are just
    like figures done by Souvestre, for instance, or of Ed.
    Fr&egrave;re. One sees them in Paris often, in fact, one finds
    them everywhere. Such persons always remind me of the women
    figures in the Gospel, perhaps because their expression is
    something like, for instance, the figure in Delaroche's
    Vendredi Saint, or in Landelle, &ldquo;Bien heureux ceux qui
    pleurent&rdquo; [blessed are they that mourn]. I know quite
    well that their conception is not perfect - there are other
    aspects even better than Delaroche's, and deeper than his, for
    instance, those of Lhermitte and Herkomer.</p>

    <p>Well, I see these too, but I can readily understand that in
    the days of Souvestre, Delaroche, Fr&egrave;re, Landelle, etc.,
    this tendency became popular, though compared with Millet and
    others it isn't quite correct and true.</p>

    <p>Is Anker still alive? I often think of his work; it is so
    serious and the sentiment is so delicate. He is a real good old
    Brion type.</p>

    <p>Boy, how I sometimes long to have you in the studio once
    more. I sincerely hope you will get the money back from
    Hendrik. As for me, I had to pay so much all at once that very
    little is left. Well, write as soon as you can, about the
    twentieth. Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
