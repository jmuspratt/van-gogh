  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>In reply to your two good letters, and as a result of
    Father's visit, for which I had been longing for some time, I
    have a few things to tell you.</p>

    <p>In the first place this. I hear from father that without my
    knowing it you have been sending me money for a long time, in
    this way effectively helping me to get on. Accept my heartfelt
    thanks, I firmly believe that you will not regret it. In this
    way I am learning a handicraft, and though it certainly will
    not make me rich, I will at any rate earn my 100 fr. a month,
    which is the least one needs to live on, as soon as I become a
    better draughtsman and get some regular work.</p>

    <p>What you told us about the painter Heyerdahl has greatly
    interested Van Rappard, as well as me. [Norwegian painter,
    temporarily in Paris at Bonnat's studio]</p>

    <p>As the former undoubtedly will write you about it himself, I
    speak about this question only in so far as it concerns me
    personally, more or less.</p>

    <p>I find much truth in your remarks about the Dutch artists,
    that it is very doubtful if one could get from them any clear
    counsel on the difficulties of perspective, etc., with which I
    am struggling. At least I quite agree with you that someone
    like Heyerdahl would be far preferable (as he seems to be such
    a versatile man) to many others who do not possess the ability
    to explain their method and to provide the necessary guidance
    and teaching. You speak of Heyerdahl as one who takes great
    pains to seek &ldquo;proportions for drawing&rdquo;; that is
    just what I need. Many a good painter has not the slightest, or
    hardly any, idea of what proportions for drawing are, or
    beautiful lines, or characteristic composition, and thought and
    poetry. Yet these are important questions which Feyen-Perrin,
    and Ulysse Butin, and Alphonse Legros - not to mention Breton
    and Millet and Isra&euml;ls - take extremely seriously, and
    never lose sight of.</p>

    <p>Many a Dutch painter would understand nothing, absolutely
    nothing, of the beautiful work of Boughton, Millais, Pinwell,
    du Maurier, Herkomer, and Walker, to name only a few artists
    who are real masters as draftsmen, not to mention their talent
    in other directions.</p>

    <p>I say many of them look with contempt on such work, as many
    do on the work of De Groux, even among the painters here in
    Belgium who ought to know better. This week I saw some things
    by De Groux which I did not know, namely, a picture,
    &ldquo;Departure of the Conscript,&rdquo; and a full-length
    drawing, &ldquo;The Drunkard&rdquo; - two compositions which
    resemble Boughton so much that I was struck by the resemblance,
    as of two brothers who had never met and who were yet of one
    mind.</p>

    <p>So you see, I quite agree with your opinion on Heyerdahl,
    and I shall be very happy if later on you could put me in touch
    with that man; further, I will not insist on carrying out my
    plan of going to Holland, at least not if I have the prospect
    of going to Paris later and can more or less count on it.</p>

    <p>But in the meantime what must I do? What do you think would
    be best? I can continue to work with Rappard for a few weeks,
    but then he will probably leave here. My bedroom is too small,
    and the light is not good, and the people would object to my
    partly shutting out the light from the window; I am not even
    allowed to put my etchings or my drawings up on the wall. So
    when Rappard leaves in May, I shall have to move; I should like
    to work awhile in the country - at Heyst, Calmphout, Etten,
    Scheveningen, Katwijk, anyplace, even nearer here, as
    Schaerbeek, Haeren, Groenendael. But preferably a place where
    there is a chance of coming into contact with other painters,
    and if possible of living and working together, because it is
    cheaper and better.</p>

    <p>Wherever it may be, living expenses are always at least 100
    fr. a month; if one has less, it means want, either physical or
    of the necessary material and tools. This winter I have spent,
    let us say, 100 fr. a month, though in reality it has scarcely
    been as much. And I spent a great deal of that on drawing
    materials and also got myself some clothes.<label content="lifestyle.clothing"> I bought two
    workmen's suits of rough black velvet, of that material known
    as veloutine. It looks well, and one can wear it everywhere
    besides, the suits will be of use to me later, because I shall
    want a great many workmen's clothes - as I do already - for my
    models, which of course I need like everybody else.</label> Gradually I
    must make such a collection, of all kinds of garments,
    secondhand if necessary, men's as well as women's; but of
    course I need not do it all at once, though I have started, and
    am going on with it.</p>

    <p>What you say is true, financial questions have either
    advanced or handicapped many people in the world. It is so, and
    Bernard Palissy's saying remains true, &ldquo;Poverty prevents
    the good spirits from arriving.&rdquo; But when I think it
    over, I cannot help wondering, Isn't it right that in a family
    like ours - in which two Messrs. Van Gogh are very rich, and
    both in the art field, Uncle Cor and our uncle of Prinsenhage,
    and in which you and I of the younger generation have chosen
    the same line, though in different spheres - isn't it right, I
    wonder, that, this being so, I should be able to count in some
    way on 100 fr. a month during the time which must necessarily
    elapse before I can get regular work as a draughtsman ? Now
    three years ago I quarreled with C. M. about quite a different
    question, but is that any reason for C. M. to remain my enemy
    forever? I would much rather think that he had never been my
    enemy and consider it a misunderstanding, for which I gladly
    take all the blame, rather than argue about how much was really
    my fault, for I have no time for such things. Uncle Cor so
    often helps other draughtsmen - would it be so unnatural now if
    someday, when I needed it, he showed me his good will? However,
    I do not say this to get financial help from him. He could help
    me in quite another way than by giving money: for instance, if
    it were possible, he might bring me into contact with persons
    from whom I could learn many things, or help me get regular
    work from some magazine.</p>

    <p>This is the way I expressed myself to Father. I noticed that
    people talked about the strange and unaccountable fact that I
    was so hard up, although I belonged to such and such a family.
    I replied that I thought it was only temporary, and would come
    right after a time. Still, I thought it better to talk it over
    with Father and you, and I wrote something about it to Mr.
    Tersteeg. But he seems to have misunderstood my intention, as
    he got the impression that I planned to live on the bounty of
    my uncles; this being his opinion, he wrote me a very
    discouraging letter, and said I had no right to do such a
    thing. I certainly do not pretend to have the right, but I want
    to prevent this affair from ever becoming the subject of gossip
    in the studios; therefore I think that it is necessary for good
    relations between myself and the family to be re-established,
    at any rate provisionally and outwardly, in expectation of
    their changing their minds about me. If they are unwilling, que
    soit, but then I should not be able to prevent gossip here and
    there. Were I immediately to write C. M. or go to see his
    Honour, it is to be feared he would not read my letter, or
    would receive me too uncordially. That's why I am talking it
    over with Pa and yourself, as you might possibly drop a word
    occasionally, so that he will not misunderstand my intentions.
    I was not hoping to get money from his Honour, as Mr. Tersteeg
    seemed to think, but only hoping that if he gained faith and
    confidence in my future after a talk with me, he might see me
    with new eyes. And if he did, it stands to reason that I most
    certainly would not scorn his help; and in that case he might
    smooth the way for me by means other than by giving me money,
    for instance, in the interval between now and my going to
    Paris.</p>

    <p>I wrote back that I was not at all astonished at his
    misconstruing my letter in this way because you yourself had
    spoken one time of &ldquo;living on my rents.&rdquo; And as I
    now gather from the tone of your letter that you no longer see
    my difficult position in that miserable light and as I infer it
    from your strong assistance, so I hope that Mr. Tersteeg's
    opinion will also change eventually. The more so because he was
    the first to help me with those Bargues, for which I shall
    always be grateful to him.</p>

    <p>You write me about a manikin. I am not in a special hurry
    for it, but it would be of great service to me in composing and
    finding the right positions, you understand that. But I would
    rather wait awhile and have a better one than take one now that
    is too defective.</p>

    <p>But please look out for all possible prints or books on
    proportion, and gather as much information about them as you
    can. It is of the greatest value to me, for without it, one
    cannot make a composition of figures quickly. Furthermore, I
    want something about the anatomy of the horse, and sheep, and
    cow - not from the veterinary point of view, but rather in
    relation to drawing those animals. If I ask you for these
    things, it is because you may occasionally find such prints
    cheaply, as I have. For instance, if you ever have the
    opportunity to ask Bargue or Viollet-le-Duc about those papers
    on proportion, they would perhaps be the best source of
    information.</p>

    <p>Of course, I should be delighted to live with you later, but
    we haven't come to that yet. If C. M. would help me to find
    some job for the time being, I certainly would not refuse
    it.</p>

    <p>Even from relatively bad artists one can learn much
    indirectly, for instance, as Mauve learned much from Verschuur
    about the perspective of a stable and a wagon, and the anatomy
    of a horse, and yet how far Mauve is above Verschuur.</p>

    <p>If you can recommend a picture by Madiol for the Salon, do
    so, for there is much that is beautiful in his work; the man is
    hard up and has a great many little children. He is now
    painting a forge; it is very good. Not long ago he painted a
    little old woman in which the drawing and especially the
    colouring are superb. But the quality of his work is uneven.
    His charcoal drawings are often excellent.</p>

    <p>This letter is rather long, but I cannot make it shorter. I
    speak about the possibility that C. M. and others should change
    their opinion of me at least outwardly but I would much rather
    it were truly so. For example, somebody like Roelofs doesn't
    know what to make of such a false position - either there must
    be something wrong with me, or with the others; but what he is
    sure of is: anyhow there is something wrong somewhere<i>.</i>
    So he is overprudent and will have nothing to do with me just
    at the moment when I most need advice or help.</p>

    <p>Such experiences are not pleasant. The main question is, Am
    I making progress by working on with patient energy? I think I
    am. &ldquo;Where there is a will, there is a way.&rdquo; And
    should I be to blame later if I took my revenge? An artist does
    not draw for the sake of revenge, but for the love of drawing;
    it urges you on more than any other motive. So perhaps some
    things that are now amiss will come right after all.</p>

    <p>This winter I collected many wood engravings. Your Millets
    have increased in number, and you will see that I did not keep
    your capital of wood engravings, etc., without their bringing
    interest. I now have twenty-four wood engravings, by and after
    Millet, counting &ldquo;Les Travaux des Champs.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But the main thing for me is to draw, and everything must
    contribute to that end. The cheapest way would perhaps be for
    me to spend this summer at Etten - I can find subjects enough
    there. If you think this right, you may write to Father about
    it. I am willing to give in about dress or anything else to
    suit them, and perhaps would meet C. M. there some day this
    summer. There are no real objections to it, as far as I know.
    Either inside or outside the family, they will always judge me
    or talk about me from different points of view, and you will
    always hear the most divergent opinions about me. And I blame
    no one for it, because relatively few people know why an artist
    acts as he does. But in general, he who searches all kinds of
    places to find picturesque spots or figures - holes and corners
    which another passes by - is accused of many bad intentions and
    villainies which have never entered his head. A peasant who
    sees me draw an old tree trunk, and sees me sitting there for
    an hour, thinks that I have gone mad and, of course, laughs at
    me. A young lady who turns up her nose at a labourer in his
    patched, filthy dirty clothes, of course cannot understand why
    anyone visits the Borinage or Heyst and goes down the shaft of
    a coal mine; she also comes to the conclusion that I am
    mad.</p>

    <p>Naturally, I do not care at all what they think if only you
    and Mr. Tersteeg, and C. M. and Father, and others with whom I
    come into contact, know better, and instead of making remarks
    about it, say, Your work demands it, and we understand why it
    is so.</p>

    <p>So I repeat, under the circumstances there is after all no
    urgent reason why I should not go, for instance, to Etten or to
    The Hague, if that were preferable, even though it may be
    criticized by some fops and silly girls. As Father said when he
    was here, &ldquo;Just write to Theo, and arrange with him what
    is best, and what will be the cheapest way.&rdquo; I hope you
    will let me know your opinion soon.</p>

    <p>Heyst and Calmphout are very picturesque. In Etten I could
    also find subjects enough, even here if necessary, though then
    I would move to Schaerbeek.</p>

    <p>Scheveningen or Katwijk would perhaps be possible if C. M.
    changed his opinion of me, and then I could profit directly or
    indirectly by the Dutch artists. As to the expenses, I suppose
    they would amount to at least 100 fr. a month; to do with less
    is impossible: &ldquo;Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he
    treadeth out the corn.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So I wait for your reply about these things, and in the
    meantime I am working with Rappard.</p>

    <p>Rappard has painted some good studies, among others a few
    after the models at the academy, which are well done. A little
    more fire and passion would not hurt him, a little more
    self-confidence and more courage. Somebody once said to me,
    &ldquo;Nous devons faire des efforts de perdus, de
    d&eacute;sesp&eacute;r&eacute;s.&rdquo; [We must make the same
    efforts as lost, desperate beings.] He does not do that as yet.
    His pen-and-ink drawings of landscape are very witty and
    charming, but in these, also, a little more passion,
    please.</p>

    <p>And now I take my leave, with a handshake, and am always</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
