  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I just received your letter. I read it over and over again
    with the greatest interest, and one thing is becoming clear to
    me, which I have often thought about without getting very
    far.</p>

    <p>That is to say, you have in common with me a time of
    secretly drawing the most impossible castles in the air, etc.,
    which drawings stand in a curious relation to the throng of
    thoughts and aspirations - useless because nobody who might
    lend a helping hand takes any notice of them (only painters
    could show the right way then, but they have their thoughts
    elsewhere). That is a great inner struggle, which ends in
    discouragement, or in giving up the ideas as impracticable, and
    just about the age of twenty-one is very eager to do so.</p>

    <p>What I may have said then, which was bound to contribute to
    that casting things overboard, at that moment my thoughts were
    perhaps the same as yours, that is to say, I regarded it as
    impossible. But as to that despairing struggle without getting
    any light anywhere, I know how awful it is too - with all one's
    energy one cannot do anything, and thinks oneself crazy, or
    Heaven knows what. In London how often I stood drawing on the
    Thames Embankment, on my way home from Southampton Street in
    the evening, and it came to nothing. If there had been someone
    then to tell me what perspective was, how much misery I should
    have been spared, how much further I should have been now!
    Well, let bygones be bygones. It has not been so.<label content="fear.shyness"> I spoke once
    or twice to Thijs Maris. I dared not speak to Boughton because
    his presence overawed me; but I did not find it there either,
    that help with the very <i>first</i> things, the A B C.</label></p>

    <p>Let me repeat now that I believe in you as an artist, and
    that you may become so still, yes, that in a very short time
    you would think over in all calmness whether you are an artist
    or not, whether you succeed in producing something or not, if
    you learned to spell the above-mentioned A B C and if at the
    same time you wandered through the cornfields and the moors, to
    renew what you yourself express as &ldquo;I used to feel myself
    part of nature; now I do not feel that way any
    longer.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Let me tell you, brother, that I myself experienced so
    deeply, so very deeply what you say there. That I have been
    through a period of nervous, arid overstraining - there were
    days when I could not see anything in the most beautiful
    landscape just because I did not feel myself part of it. It is
    the street and the office and the care and the nerves that make
    it so.</p>

    <p>Do not be angry with me when I say that at this moment your
    soul is sick - it is true, you know; it is not right for you
    not to feel yourself part of nature, and I think the most
    important thing is to restore that. I must look into my own
    past to find why I lived in that stony, arid mood for years,
    and why it became worse instead of better, though I tried to
    remedy it.</p>

    <p>Not only did I feel hardened instead of sensitive toward
    nature, but, much worse still, I felt exactly the same toward
    people.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.mental">They said I was out of my mind, but I knew myself that it
    was not true, for the very reason that I felt my own disease
    deep within me, and tried to remedy it. I exhausted myself with
    hopeless, unsuccessful efforts, it is true, but because of that
    fixed idea of reaching a normal point of view again, I never
    mistook my own desperate doings, worryings and drudgings for my
    real innermost self. At least I always felt, &ldquo;Just let me
    do something, be somewhere, and it <i>must</i> redress itself.
    I will rise above it, let me keep hold of patience to redress
    things.&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>I do not believe somebody like &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;(?) for
    instance - who proved really to be insane - thought that way,
    and therefore I repeat, I have often thought those years of
    grubbing over, but I do not see how in those circumstances I
    could have been different from what I was.</p>

    <p>This was the ground which gave way under my feet; think how
    miserable anyone would be if such a ground gave way. I had been
    with Goupil for six years. I was rooted there, and thought that
    if I left them, I could look back on six years of clean work,
    and that if I presented myself elsewhere, I might refer to my
    past with full assurance.</p>

    <p>It was by no means so; things are done so hurriedly that
    there is but little time for reflection, for questions or
    arguments. People act according to very arbitrary, very
    superficial impressions, and once one has left G. &amp; Co.,
    nobody remembers who G. &amp; Co. is. It is a name like X &amp;
    Co., without any meaning, so one is simply &ldquo;someone out
    of work.&rdquo; At once, suddenly, inevitably, that is how it
    is everywhere. Of course, just because one possesses a certain
    proper pride, one does not say, I am Mr. So-and-so, I am this
    or that. One applies for a new position in full earnest,
    without many words, fully intending to put one's hand to the
    plough. All right, but by and by a person out of work,
    &ldquo;L'homme de quelque part,&rdquo; becomes a suspicious
    character.</p>

    <p>Now imagine your new boss to be a man whose business is
    rather mysterious, imagine him to have but one goal,
    &ldquo;money.&rdquo; Can you, with all your energy, at once, on
    the spot, help him to a big amount? Not very likely, don't you
    think? But he wants money, money &ldquo;quand
    m&ecirc;me&rdquo;; you want to know a little more about the
    business, and what you see or hear is rather disgusting.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A person out of work&rdquo; - &ldquo;I do not want
    you any longer&rdquo; soon is the answer.</p>

    <p>Well, look here, you are becoming more and more &ldquo;a
    person without work.&rdquo; You may go to England, you may go
    to America - it does not matter, you will be like an uprooted
    tree everywhere G. &amp; Co., where you had been rooted since
    your earliest years, G. &amp; Co., though indirectly they
    brought you to grief, because as a boy you thought them the
    finest, the best, the biggest in the world; G. &amp; Co. -
    <i>if</i> you came back to them (I have not done so, I
    <i>could</i> not do it, my heart was too full, much too full) -
    G. &amp; Co. would give you the cold shoulder, with a
    &ldquo;nous n'avons plus &agrave; nous en occuper.&rdquo; [We
    need no longer bother about it.] For all that, one is uprooted,
    and the world reverses the facts and says that you have
    uprooted yourself. The fact is - your place no longer knows
    you.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">I felt too melancholy
    to try to redress things, and I do not
    remember ever having been in a mood to speak about it to
    anybody the way I do to you now.</label> Because, to my surprise, in
    your letter I read the words, &ldquo;The gentlemen made things
    almost impossible when I spoke to them this week,&rdquo; and I
    never for a moment had supposed they would dare treat you as
    they did me. My dear boy, you know how things are with me, but
    if you are feeling miserable about one thing and another, don't
    feel <i>alone</i>. It is <i>too much</i> to bear <i>alone</i>,
    and in part, at least, I can sympathize with you.</p>

    <p>Now, stick to your point, and don't let your grief let you
    lose your head; if the gentlemen behave like that, then stand
    on your honour, and do not accept your dismissal except on
    conditions which guarantee your getting a new situation.</p>

    <p>Don't fly into a rage, they are not worth that, <i>though
    they incite you to it</i>. I flew into a rage and walked
    out.</p>

    <p>Now again, my position was different from yours. I was one
    of the least, you, one of the foremost, yet I am afraid you
    would feel what I say about being uprooted too if you were out
    of it, so face this fact coolly, don't give in, and don't let
    yourself be turned out without being somewhat prepared for the
    difficult situation of having to start anew.</p>

    <p>And in that extreme case: do <i>not</i> go to America, for
    it is just the same there as in Paris. No, beware of the moment
    when one says, I shall make myself scarce; I went through that
    moment myself, I hope you will not know it. And <i>if</i> it
    comes your way, I repeat, Beware of it, resist it quite
    collectedly, and say, This proves that I am striking a stone
    wall. Such a wall is for bulls to beat against; it is true that
    I am a bull myself, but an intelligent one, I am a bull in the
    matter of becoming an artist. In short, don't let yourself be
    induced to crush your own skull, that's all. I do not say
    things will turn out that way; I only hope there will be no
    question whatever of striking a stone wall.</p>

    <p>And know this well, in case of being uprooted, in case of a
    failure when starting anew, do not despair. Suppose there were
    a whirlpool somewhere, with sharp-edged, rocky promontories;
    well, then I should just think one might sail around them,
    mightn't one? You will perhaps admit that rock to be there, as
    you yourself pulled me out of that whirlpool when I myself no
    longer had any hope of getting out, and was hopelessly unable
    to struggle against it any longer.</p>

    <p>I mean, sail around that whirlpool at a great distance - it
    has already begun to suck you in to the extent of your being
    estranged from nature. Do you think me foolish if I dare to
    say, Change your course enough <i>now</i> so that you try to
    restore the harmony between yourself and nature? The longer you
    remain in this mood, the more you foster nervousness, your
    constant enemy and mine. I have had more experience than you
    with what tricks it <i>might</i> play on you.</p>

    <p>You are now entering upon a situation that may disturb you
    in so far as the relation with nature is disrupted. Take this
    quite calmly as a sign of aberration. Say, &ldquo;Oh, no, not
    that way, please.&rdquo; Look for a new aim, an interest in
    something, for instance, think that basically perspective must
    be the simplest of all things after all, and chiaroscuro, a
    simple, not a complicated thing. It must be something that
    speaks for itself, otherwise I do not care much for it. Try to
    get back to nature this way.</p>

    <p>Well, simply believe this, boy, that while writing this, I
    have got back something of the same feeling of years ago. That
    I again take pleasure in castles in the air, for instance, that
    especially here in Drenthe I am feeling pretty much the way I
    did at the time when first I began to see the beauty of art.
    You will agree with me when I call this normal, won't you? I
    mean to admire the things of nature, to be calm enough to draw
    them, to paint them.</p>

    <p>But suppose <i>you</i> are faced by a stone wall, would you
    think a person in my frame of mind tranquil enough to be
    tempted to take a little walk with you to divert your thoughts
    at the moment when, because of nervous tension, these thoughts
    are beginning to contain an element of despair? At the core you
    are yourself, and have not changed, but your nerves are getting
    upset from overstrain. Well, take care of your nerves, and do
    not think lightly of them, for they may tempt you to
    quick-tempered manoeuvers; anyway, you know something about
    that yourself.</p>

    <p>Theo, understand clearly what I mean at this moment: Father,
    Mother, Wil, Marie and particularly I myself are all assisted
    by you; you think you will have to stick it out for all our
    sakes, and believe me, I quite enter into your feelings about
    this, at least I can sympathize with them to a great extent.
    But think it over. What is the purpose - your own purpose and
    Father's, Mother's, Wil's, Marie's and mine? What do we all
    want? We want to pull through, acting righteously; we all want
    to arrive at a clear position, not a false position, don't we?
    This is what we want unanimously and earnestly, however much or
    little we may differ. What is it that we all want to set
    against fate? All, all of us without exception, want to work
    steadily, want quiet. Am I wrong in looking at the situation
    this way? All right, what is facing us now? A calamity is
    facing us which, hitting you, will hit us all. All right. A
    thunderstorm is threatening us; we see it threaten, we may be
    struck by lightning. All right, what are we going to do now?
    Are we frightened out of our wits? I do not think this would be
    our state of mind - although we all have certain nerves in our
    bodies, although certain fibres of the heart even more delicate
    than nerves might be shocked or suffer pain. &ldquo;We are
    today what we were yesterday,&rdquo; even if the lightning
    strikes, even if the thunder rolls. Are we or aren't we the
    sort who can face things collectedly? - that's the simple
    question, and I do not see any reason why we should not be.</p>

    <p>What I further see is this:</p>

    <p>That at this moment our mutual position is straight; to keep
    it so, a closer solidarity between us is desirable, and in my
    opinion, there are in ourselves a few things which we must
    settle between us.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">In the first place I should think it a very good thing if
    your relations with Marie were put on a firmer basis, if
    possible a formal engagement.</label> In the second place I should wish
    that we both understood that circumstances urgently demand that
    Brabant no longer be closed to me. I myself think it best
    <i>not</i> to go there if it can be avoided, but in case of a
    calamity, as Father has a house there rent-free, I might save
    the rent I am obliged to pay here.</p>

    <p>I have reached the point where my work will probably yield
    <i>some</i> profit soon. And now if we could reduce the
    expenses to a minimum, even below the present rate, I could
    perhaps earn a little instead of spending, become positive
    instead of negative.</p>

    <p>If this is urgent that we <i>must</i> earn money, I see a
    chance of it in that way, if they have patience at home, if
    they realize what is necessary, and especially if the whole
    family helps in the question of posing for me.</p>

    <p>As to their being my models, they should decidedly have to
    do what I want, they should have to trust in my having reasons
    for it. If I say to them, You must pose, they ought to do so.
    Of course I would not ask anything unreasonable.</p>

    <p>You remember the basic cause of my leaving home, a
    misunderstanding of each other in almost <i>everything</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Can</i> one live together in such a case? <i>Yes, for a
    time</i>, if it <i>must</i> be, and if both sides feel that
    everything must be subordinated to what the <i>force majeur</i>
    of circumstances demands. I wish that had been understood <i>at
    the time</i>; besides, I did not take the initiative in going
    away; but when I was told to go, I went.</p>

    <p>Well, I just mention this, because I see that circumstances
    may demand that you <i>must have</i> your hands free, and if my
    living at home for a time might further that, I think Father
    and I must agree to it at once. Though, if it is not absolutely
    necessary - &ldquo;tant mieux&rdquo; - but I do not say that I
    absolutely <i>must</i> be in Drenthe, it doesn't matter in the
    least where I am.</p>

    <p>So rest assured on that score, I would do anything you
    thought advisable.</p>

    <p>And today I shall simply write Father this: In case Theo
    considers it advisable that my expenses be reduced to a minimum
    and I should have to live at home for a while, I hope, for
    myself as much as for you, that we shall possess the wisdom
    <i>not</i> to make a mess of things by discord, and that,
    ignoring the past, we shall resign ourselves to what the new
    circumstances may bring. Nothing further about you or about
    business matters, and in case I should have to live at home, I
    should not speak about you otherwise than in general terms. And
    certainly <i>not</i> mention Marie for the present.</p>

    <p>Theo, when, perhaps a year ago, you said you would certainly
    not become a painter, but would definitely stay in your present
    profession, I could not but acquiesce; now I no longer
    acquiesce to the same extent: throughout the history of art one
    repeatedly finds the phenomenon of two brothers being painters.
    I know that the future is unpredictable, at least for myself I
    declare that I do not know how things will turn out. But it is
    a fact that I believe in you as a painter, in which belief I am
    strengthened by your last letter.</p>

    <p>But mind, there is one thing I tell you is urgently
    necessary. Beware of your nerves - avail yourself of all means
    to keep your mind at ease. If it is possible, go and consult a
    doctor every day, not particularly because a doctor could do
    something for you that would prove effective, but because the
    measure of going to see a doctor, etc., would force you to bear
    in mind, <i>this</i> is nervousness, <i>this</i> is what I am.
    It is a question of self-knowledge, of serenity notwithstanding
    all the tricks nerves <i>must</i> play. As I see it, the whole
    idea of the <i>possibility</i> of making yourself scarce is
    caused by nerves. Assume this to be the case, and you will do
    wisely and well.</p>

    <p>I hope you will <i>not</i> pull off a coup; I hope you will
    <i>not</i> make a financial invention; I hope you will become a
    painter. If your cool, self-possessed exterior shows that you
    do not give a damn about the crisis the gentlemen have
    purposely conjured up, it will be like water off a duck's back
    with you; tell them, &ldquo;I'm not leaving like that,
    certainly not at present, <i>never</i> that way&rdquo; - if you
    say, I have plans, but they are not even of a commercial
    nature, and as soon as they are ripe for execution, I shall
    withdraw in all quietness; until such time, as long as you can
    find no fault with my activities and behaviour, leave things as
    they are; but bear in mind that you would be gravely mistaken
    in my personality if you thought that I should run away because
    you make the situation unbearable for me, or that I should part
    with you in an unreasonable way. Do you want to get rid of me?
    All right, I for my part want to be rid of you, but amicably
    and in an orderly way - that, however, you are not the
    slightest bit bent on staying, but that you will not get out
    before you see a favourable moment. I think this is the way in
    which you will be able to frustrate what they are now trying to
    do to make it impossible for you to stay on. Perhaps they
    suspect you of entering into negotiations with others, and in
    such a case their making things impossible might be venomous
    indeed. If they should turn venomous, nothing can be done, so
    forestall it - perhaps mentioning in a quiet way on what terms
    you should be willing to retire would be the best thing to
    do.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, if I should have to go home for a time in
    order to give you a free hand, please give me warning. And
    again - Father, Mother, Wil, Marie and I, in a word all of us,
    think more of you than of your money. This making yourself
    scarce is purely nerves.</p>

    <p>But redress - try to redress if you cannot do it at once -
    the relation between yourself and nature and people. And if it
    cannot be done in any other way than by your becoming a
    painter, well then, do so, notwithstanding all objections and
    obstacles. Say, do write soon, be sure you do so, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I am sending you the enclosed sketches to give you an idea
    of the many extremely different things this apparently
    monotonous country presents. You see, I am just sampling at
    random - I catch hold of one thing and another; later things
    will arrange themselves and settle into shape of their own
    accord. But here I will not begin with a prearranged plan; on
    the contrary, I want my plan to result from my studies. As yet
    I do not know the real character of the country; now I draw
    everything that presents itself, but later on, after some
    experience, I shall try to reproduce it in its real
    character.</p>

    <p>One thing depends so much on another that one must catch
    hold of everything; however much one should like to concentrate
    on a single subject, not one thing can be left out.</p>

    <p>So there is work enough. I now have a pretty large room
    (where a stove has been put), which happens to have a small
    balcony, from which I can see the heath with the huts. In the
    distance I see a very curious drawbridge.</p>

    <p>Downstairs there is the inn, and a farmer's kitchen with a
    peat fire on the hearth, very cosy in the evening. Such a
    fireplace with a cradle beside it is an excellent place for
    meditation. When I am feeling melancholy or worried about
    something, I just run downstairs for a while.</p>

    <p>I can tell you that in a roundabout way I have heard
    something about the woman. I could not imagine why she did not
    write me.</p>

    <p>So I wrote the carpenter next door, if the woman had not
    been to ask my address. And the scoundrel answered: &ldquo;Oh
    yes, sir, but I thought you wouldn't like her to know your
    address, so I pretended not to know it.&rdquo; The damned
    wretch.</p>

    <p>So I wrote her at once, though it was not as good as the
    express arrangement I had made with him and with her; but I do
    not want to hide myself <i>now</i> or <i>ever</i>, and I
    would rather write her at her family's address than conceal
    myself in any way. That's my opinion about it. And I also sent
    her some money; if this should have bad consequences, I am not
    responsible for it. I <i>will not</i> act falsely. I found that
    scoundrel's letter at Hoogeveen on my last visit there.</p>

    <p>Friend Rappard has written to me again from Terschelling,
    and now today from Utrecht - he is home again. He has brought
    studies from there, especially of the almshouse. I don't
    understand it exactly, he told me the doctor had prescribed sea
    air for him during the winter; besides, he longed to spend a
    winter in the country, but it seems to have turned out
    differently in the end.</p>

    <p>You wrote to me about Liebermann: his palette consists of
    slate-grey tones, principally running from brown to
    yellowish-grey. I have never seen anything of his, but now that
    I have seen the landscape here, I can understand perfectly how
    logically he is led to it.</p>

    <p>Often the colour of things reminds me of Michel; you know,
    he also has a grey sky (slate-coloured sometimes), a brown soil
    with yellowish-greys. It is absolutely true, and according to
    nature.</p>

    <p>There are Jules Dupr&eacute; effects, to be sure, but in
    this autumn season it is exactly that - and you describe
    Leibermann's palette. And if I may find what I seek - and why
    shouldn't I find it? - I shall certainly often do it in the
    same way, in that same chromatic gamut.</p>

    <p>Mind you, to see it like that, <label content="art.theory">one must not look at the
    local colour by itself, but in conjunction with the colour of
    the sky!</p>

    <p>That sky is grey -but so iridescent that even our pure white
    would be unable to render <i>this</i> light and shimmer. Now,
    if one begins by painting this sky grey, thus remaining far
    below the intensity of nature, how much more necessary it is to
    tone down the browns and yellowish-greys of the soil to a lower
    key, in order to be consistent. I think if once one analyses it
    thus, it is so logical, one can hardly understand not having
    always seen it so.</label></p>

    <p>But it is the local colour of a green field, or a ruddy
    brown heath, which, considered apart, easily leads one
    astray.</p>

    <p>Write again soon, for your last letter was remarkably brief,
    too brief, but it was obviously written in the office.</p>

    <p>What about that Triennial Exhibition? There will be many
    beautiful things. I long to hear about it, because these
    certainly are the characteristic things of the present, and not
    of past years. So if you have a moment, tell me about it.</p>

    <p>There was a rumour that Liebermann is somewhere here in the
    neighbourhood. I should like to meet him.</p>

    <p>I must say I am very glad to have found a better place to
    work in, so that I needn't sit idle at home now that there is
    so much rain and bad weather is expected. I wish you could see
    the country here. In the evening it is inexpressibly
    beautiful.</p>

    <p>And I think, with snow, it will also be splendid.</p>

    <p>I read a very beautiful little book of Carlyle's, Heroes and
    Hero Worship<i>,</i> nice sayings, as, for instance: we have
    the <i>duty</i> to be <i>brave</i>, though in general this is
    wrongly considered to be an exception. In life it is the same,
    goodness rises so high above everything that of course we
    cannot reach such a height. The most reasonable thing, and the
    thing that makes life less impossible, is to put our gamut in a
    lower key, and not to try to be luminous, and not to subside
    into dullness.</p>

    <p>One finds here the most wonderful types of Nonconformist
    clergymen, with pigs' faces and three-cornered hats. Also
    adorable Jews, who look uncommonly ugly amidst Millet-like
    types or on this naive, desolate moor. But they are very
    characteristic. I travelled with a party of Jews who held
    theological discussions with some farmers. How is it possible
    for such absurdities to exist in a country like this? Why
    couldn't they look out of the windows or smoke their pipes, or
    at least behave as reasonably as, for instance, their pigs,
    which make no disturbance whatever, though they are pigs, and
    are in place in these surroundings and in harmony with them.
    But before the clergymen of the type I saw here reach the
    -cultural and rational level of ordinary pigs, they must
    improve considerably, and probably it will take ages before
    they arrive at this point. Now any pig is better, as far as I
    can see.</p>

    <p>Well, I am off again for a walk, write me if you can spare a
    moment, and look out for something of Liebermann's at the
    exhibition.</p>

    <p>Good-by, my address is here for the present. Best wishes,
    with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
