  <body>
    <p>My dear comrade Bernard,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your kind letter and for the enclosed sketches of
    your decoration, which I think very funny. Sometimes I regret
    that I cannot make up my mind to work more at home and
    extempore. The imagination is certainly a faculty which we must
    develop, one which alone can lead us to the creation of a more
    exalting and consoling nature than the single brief glance at
    reality - which in our sight is ever changing, passing like a
    flash of lightning - can let us perceive.</p>

    <p>A starry sky, for example. See, that's a thing I'd
    like to try to do, just as by day I want to
    try to paint a green meadow spangled with starry dandelions. Yet how can I do it,
    unless I work it out at home, and from my imagination? Of course, this
    faults my  idea while yours gets praised.</p>

    <p>At the moment I am absorbed in the blooming fruit trees,
    pink peach trees, yellow-white pear trees. <label content="art.technique">My brush stroke has
    no system at all. I hit the canvas with irregular touches of
    the brush, which I leave as they are. Patches of thickly
    laid-on colour, spots of canvas left uncovered, here or there
    portions that are left absolutely unfinished, repetitions,
    savageries; in short, I am inclined to think that the result is
    so disquieting and irritating as to be a godsend to those
    people who have preconceived ideas about technique.</label> For that
    matter here is a sketch, <art id=0554>the entrance to a Proven&ccedil;al
    orchard with its yellow fences, its enclosure of black
    cypresses (against the mistral), its characteristic vegetables
    of varying greens: yellow lettuces, onions, garlic, emerald
    leeks</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">Working directly on the spot all the time, I try to grasp
    what is essential in the drawing - later I fill in the spaces
    which are bounded by contours - either expressed or not, but in
    any case <i>felt</i> - with tones which are also simplified, by
    which I mean that all that is going to be soil will share the
    same violet-like tone, that the whole sky will have a blue
    tint, that the green vegetation will be either green-blue or
    yellow-green, purposely exaggerating the yellows and blues in
    this case.</label></p>

    <p>In short, my dear comrade, in no case an eye-deceiving job.
    <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>As for visiting Aix, Marseilles, Tangier, no fear of that.
    If notwithstanding this I should go there, it would be in
    search of cheaper lodgings. Otherwise I am convinced that even
    if I were to work all my life, I should not be able to do one
    half of all that is characteristic in this town alone.</p>

    <p>By the way, I have seen bullfights in the arena, or rather
    sham fights, seeing that the bulls were numerous but there was
    nobody to fight them. However, the crowd was magnificent, those
    great colourful multitudes piled up one above the other on two
    or three galleries, with the effect of sun and shade and the
    shadow cast by the enormous ring.</p>

    <p>I wish you a good journey - a handshake in thought.</p>

    <p>Your friend, Vincent</p>
