  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter and the 50 Fr. note it contained.
    Of course I am now safe until the arrival of your letter after
    the first. What happened about that money was entirely pure
    chance and misunderstanding, for which neither you nor I are
    responsible. By just the same mischance I could not telegraph
    as you said, because I did not know if you were still in
    Amsterdam or back in Paris. It is over now with the rest, and
    is one more proof of the proverb that misfortunes never come
    singly. Roulin left yesterday (of course my wire yesterday was
    sent off before the arrival of your letter of this morning). It
    was touching to see him with his children this last day,
    especially with the quite tiny one, when he made her laugh and
    jump on his knee, and sang for her.</p>

    <p>His voice has a strangely pure and touching quality in which
    there was for my ear at once a sweet and mournful cradle-song,
    and a kind of far-away echo of the trumpet of revolutionary
    France. He was not sad, however. On the contrary, he had put on
    his brand new uniform, which he had received that very day, and
    everyone was making much of him.</p>

    <p>I have just finished a new canvas which almost has what one
    might call a certain chic about it, <art id=0502>a wicker basket with lemons
    and oranges, a cypress branch and a pair of blue gloves</art>. You have already seen some
    of these baskets of fruit of mine.</p>

    <p>Look here - you do know that what I am trying to do is to
    get back the money that my training as a painter has cost,
    neither more nor less.</p>

    <p>I have a right to that, and to the earning of my daily
    bread.</p>

    <p>I think it just that there should be that return, I don't
    say into your hands, since what we have done we have done
    together, and to talk of money distresses us so much.</p>

    <p>But let it go to your wife's hands, who will join with us
    besides in working with the artists.</p>

    <p>If I am not yet devoting much thought to direct sales, it is
    because my count of pictures is not yet complete, but it is
    getting on, and I have set to work again with a nerve like
    iron.</p>

    <p>I have good and ill luck in my production, but not ill luck
    <i>only</i>. For instance, if our Monticelli bunch of flowers
    is worth 500 francs to a collector, and it is, then I dare
    swear to you that my sunflowers are worth 500 francs too, to
    one of these Scots or Americans.</p>

    <p>Now to get up heat enough to melt that gold, those
    flower-tones, it isn't any old person who can do it, it needs
    the force and concentration of a single individual whole and
    entire.</p>

    <p>When I saw my canvases again after my illness the one that
    seemed the best to me was <art id=0482>the &ldquo;Bedroom.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>The amount we handle is a respectable enough sum, I admit,
    but much of it runs away, and what we'll have to watch above
    all is that from year's end to year's end it doesn't all slip
    through the net. That is why as the month goes on I keep more
    or less trying to balance the outlay with the output, at least
    in relative terms.</p>

    <p>So many difficulties certainly do make me rather worried and
    timorous, but I haven't given up hope yet.</p>

    <p>The trouble I foresee is that we shall have to be very
    prudent so as to prevent the expenses of a sale lowering the
    sale itself, when the time for it comes. How many times we have
    had occasion to see just that mischance in the lives of
    artists.</p>

    <p>I have in hand <art id=0508>the portrait of Roulin's wife</art>, which I was working on
    before I was ill. In it I had ranged the reds from pink to an orange, which rises through the
    yellows to lemon, with light and sombre greens. If I could
    finish it, I should be very glad, but I am afraid she will no
    longer want to pose with her husband away.</p>

    <p>You can see just what a disaster Gauguin's leaving is,
    because it has thrust us down again just when we had made a
    home and furnished it to take in our friends in bad times.</p>

    <p>Only in spite of it we will keep the furniture, etc. And
    though everyone will now be afraid of me, in time that may
    disappear.</p>

    <p>We are all mortal and subject to all the ailments there are,
    and if the latter aren't exactly of an agreeable kind, what can
    one do about it? The best thing is to try to get rid of
    them.</p>

    <p>I feel remorse too when I think of the trouble that, however
    involuntarily, I on my side caused Gauguin.</p>

    <p>But up to the last days I saw one thing only, that he was
    working with his mind divided between the desire to go to Paris
    to carry out his plans, and the life at Arles.</p>

    <p>What will come of all this for him?</p>

    <p>You will doubtless be feeling that though you have a good
    salary, nevertheless we lack capital, except in goods, and that
    in order really to alter the unhappy position of the artists
    that we know, we need to be in a stronger position. But then we
    often run up against sheer distrust on their part, and the
    things they are perpetually scheming among themselves, which
    always end in - a blank. I think that at Pont-Aven they had
    already formed a new group of 5 or 6, perhaps already broken
    up.</p>

    <p>They are not dishonest, it is something without a name and
    one of their <i>enfant terrible</i> faults.</p>

    <p>Meantime the great thing is that your marriage should not be
    delayed. By getting married you will set Mother's mind at rest
    and make her happy, and it is after all almost a necessity in
    view of your position in society and in commerce. Will it be
    appreciated by the society to which you belong, perhaps not,
    any more than the artists ever suspect that I have sometimes
    worked and suffered for the community&hellip;So from me, your
    brother, you will not want completely ordinary congratulations
    and assurances that you are about to be transported straight
    into paradise. And with your wife you will not be lonely any
    more; which I could wish for our sister as well.</p>

    <p>That, after your own marriage, is what I should set my heart
    on more than anything.</p>

    <p>When you are married, perhaps there will be other marriages
    in the family, and in any case you will see your way clear and
    the house will not be empty any more.</p>

    <p>Whatever I think on other points, our father and mother were
    exemplary as married people.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">And I shall never forget Mother at Father's death, when she
    only said one small word: it made me begin to love dear old
    Mother more than before. In fact as married people our parents
    were exemplary, like Roulin and his wife, to cite another
    instance.</label></p>

    <p>Well, go straight ahead along that road. During my illness I
    saw again every room of the house at Zundert, every path, every
    plant in the garden, the views from the fields round about, the
    neighbors, the graveyard, the church, our kitchen garden
    behind-down to the magpie's nest in a tall acacia in the
    graveyard.</p>

    <p>It's because I still have earlier recollections of those
    first days than any of the rest of you. There is no one left
    who remembers all this but Mother and me.</p>

    <p>I say no more about it, since it is better that I should not
    try to recall all that passed through my head then.</p>

    <p>Only please realize that I shall be very happy when your
    marriage has taken place. Look here now, if for your wife's
    sake it would perhaps be as well to have a picture of mine from
    time to time at Goupil's, then I will give up my grudge against
    them, in this way.</p>

    <p>I said I did not want to go back to them with too naive a
    picture.</p>

    <p>But if you like you can exhibit <art id=0456>the two </art>pictures<art id=0458> of
    sunflowers.</art></p>

    <p>Gauguin would be glad to have one, and I should very much
    like to give Gauguin a real pleasure. So if he wants one of the
    two canvases, all right, I will do one of them over again,
    whichever he likes.</p>

    <p>You will see that these canvases will catch the eye. But I
    would advise you to keep them for yourself, just for your own
    private pleasure and that of your wife.</p>

    <p>It is a kind of painting that rather changes in character,
    and takes on a richness the longer you look at it.</p>

    <p>Besides, you know, Gauguin likes them extraordinarily. He
    said to me among other things - &ldquo;That...it's...the
    flower.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>You know that the peony is Jeannin's, the hollyhock belongs
    to Quost, but the sunflower is somewhat my own.</p>

    <p>And after all I should like to go on exchanging my things
    with Gauguin even if sometimes it would cost me also rather
    dear.</p>

    <p>Did you during your hasty visit see <art id=0489>the portrait of Mme.
    Ginoux in black and yellow? That portrait was painted in
    three-quarters of an hour</art>. I must stop for the
    moment.</p>

    <p>The delay of the money was pure chance, and neither you nor
    I could do anything about it. A handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
