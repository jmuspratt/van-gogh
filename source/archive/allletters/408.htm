  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter and for the enclosed 50 francs,
    which were particularly welcome this month because of the
    moving. I think that in the long run I shall gain a lot of time
    by living in the studio, as I can set to work, for instance,
    immediately after getting up, whereas at home it was such that
    I could not do anything.</p>

    <p>These last days I have been working hard on drawings.</p>

    <p>They are busy pulling down the old tower in the fields. So
    there was an auction of lumber and slates and old iron,
    including the cross.</p>

    <p>I have finished <art id=1230>a watercolour of it</art>, in the
    style of <art id=1113>the lumber auction</art>, but better I think; I also had
    another large watercolour of the churchyard, but so far it has
    been a failure.</p>

    <p>Yet I have it well in my head, i.e. what I want to express -
    and perhaps I shall get what I mean onto the third sheet of
    paper. And if not, then not. I have just sponged out the two
    failures, but I am going to try again.</p>

    <p>If you like, you can have the one of the auction.</p>

    <p>Then I'm working on a large study of <art id=0083>a cottage by night</art>.
     And about six heads. All this was the reason for
    my not having answered your letter yet.</p>

    <p>I am working as hard as I can, because I'm thinking of going
    to the Antwerp exhibition with that friend of mine in
    Eindhoven, if I can manage it. And then I should like to take
    some work with me to show thee if possible.</p>

    <p>I am anxious to hear if Portier has seen <art id=0082>the potato eaters</art>.
    What you say of the figure is true, that as figure studies they
    are not what the heads are. That's why I've thought of trying
    it in quite a different way, for instance, starting with the
    torso instead of the head.</p>

    <p>But then it would have become quite different. As to the way
    they sit, however, don't forget those people do not sit on
    chairs like those in Caf&eacute; Duval, for instance.</p>

    <p>The finest thing I saw was when the woman was simply
    kneeling down, that's in the <i>first</i> sketch I sent
    you.</p>

    <p>Well, now it's painted the way it is, and we will try it
    again someday and then certainly not in the same way.</p>

    <p>I am also very busy these days, drawing figures.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Thanks also for the copy of Le Temps you sent, with the
    article about the Salon by Paul Mantz.</p>

    <p>I haven't read such a good article in a long time.</p>

    <p>I think it very good - the beginning - the picture of those
    Laplanders, who, after the long winter's night, see the sun
    rise from their dark hut - how in art they are also waiting for
    light.</p>

    <p>Then immediately after, his pointing to Millet, who has
    decidedly given new light - &ldquo;et qui restera.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then his pointing out Lhermitte as Millet's successor. I
    think it all manly language, and perfectly correct, and broadly
    observed.</label></p>

    <p>But I think it a pity that he calls Roll a
    &ldquo;commen&ccedil;ant&rdquo; [beginner], for that means
    slighting him, and Roll has already made so many beautiful
    things and is &ldquo;hors ligne.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>At least his &ldquo;Gr&egrave;ve de Mineurs&rdquo; [Miner's
    Strike] is already &ldquo;hors ligne.&rdquo; When Paul Mantz
    says that Roll's labourers do not work hard, and that it is
    &ldquo;un r&ecirc;ve&rdquo; [a dream], well - it is prettily
    said, and there is some truth in it. But, after all, Roll is
    right, because it is Paris and not the sober work of the
    field.</p>

    <p>A workman in the city is after all exactly the way Roll
    paints him.</p>

    <p>Rappard has a picture at Antwerp which I think must be very
    fine, at least in my opinion the sketch, which hardly anybody
    approved of, was very good. I think him very clever.</p>

    <p>Have you finished Zola's Germinal? I should love to read it,
    and shall send it back within a fortnight. Has Lhermitte's
    &ldquo;May&rdquo; already appeared?</p>

    <p>In Mantz's article, I also think very good and logical what
    he says in a very few words about colour, when he speaks of,
    &ldquo;des bleus cenr&eacute;s, que nous aimons&rdquo; [the
    ashy blues, which we love], and &ldquo;les herbes de la prarie
    sont tr&egrave;s vertes, le taureau est brun roux, la jeune
    fille est rose, voil&agrave; l'accord de 3 tons - &rdquo; [the
    grass of the meadow is very green, the bull is brown-red, the
    young girl is pink, there you have the harmony of 3 tones -]
    when he discusses that same question with respect to
    Lhermitte.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I can imagine Besnard must be interesting.</p>

    <p>I don't know whether you noticed that there is a very short
    remark about &ldquo;enthusiasm&rdquo; in Mantz's articles and
    how there is also something about &ldquo;le grain de folie qui
    est le meilleur de l'art.&rdquo; [the grain of madness that is
    the best of art.]</p>

    <p>I know you wrote, &ldquo;He may be more of an enthusiast
    than a merchant, which is better perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Coming from you, this expression is mild enough.</p>

    <p>I myself, however, think that enthusiasm is not at all
    incompatible with being a dealer. And I simply remind you of
    Mouret and Bourdoncle. Mantz also gives a few words to
    &ldquo;cette maladie qu'on appelle sagesse&rdquo; [that disease
    which they call wisdom], and hits the nail on the head.</p>

    <p>What shall I say? - the future and experience will someday
    repeat what I cannot find the right words for. I mean that
    enthusiasm sometimes calculates even better than those cool
    heads which reckon themselves &ldquo;above such things.&rdquo;
    And instinct, inspiration, impulse, and conscience are better
    guides than many people think. And however that may be, I for
    one agree with the saying, &ldquo;Mieux vaut crever de passion,
    que crever d'ennui.&rdquo; [It is better to die of passion than
    to die of boredom.]</p>

    <p>How singular it is that I still <i>cannot</i> look upon your
    present views as <i>final</i>.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">This week the document bearing on the inheritance arrived. I
    abided by what I had said at first - Mother seems to want it
    transferred in her own name, but I cannot help that - I have
    abided by what I said. I hear a lady is going to be taken in as
    a boarder - you will understand that it is not pleasant for
    them if I come too often, nor is it pleasant for me to go there
    very often. An occasional visit, once in a while, is
    sufficient.</label><label content="attitude.sisters"> I think them
    - I know, contrary to your opinion and
    contrary to theirs - I think those at home very, very far from
    sincere, and moreover, seeing that there are lots of other
    things I object to on what I consider sufficient grounds, I
    look upon Father's death and the inheritance as a matter I can
    withdraw from in all tranquillity, as I foresee that the
    character of the three sisters (all three of them) will not
    improve with time, but on the contrary, will get worse, and at
    any rate, just now it is utterly unsympathetic to me. Do you
    remember how sympathetically I wrote about Wil during Mother's
    illness? Well, it was just a short-lived freak - and it is
    frozen up again. Have you read L'&eacute;vangeliste by Daudet?
    If so, you will find in it better words to express what I mean
    than mine.</label></p>

    <p>I see quite well that you do your best to conciliate us,
    but, my dear fellow, after all I wish them no harm, do I? - and
    likewise I do them no harm. However, I don't want to exert any
    influence on them, as in the first place they themselves would
    not understand it, and in the second place they would be
    unwilling to understand it.</p>

    <p>The old tower will be pulled down next week! The spire has
    already gone. <art id=0084>I'm working on a picture of it</art>.
    In these new drawings I have been starting the figures from the
    torso, and it seems to me that they become fuller and broader
    this way. If fifty are not enough, I shall draw a hundred, and
    if that is still not enough, even more, till I have exactly
    what I want, namely that everything is round and that thee is,
    so to speak, neither beginning nor end to the figure anywhere,
    but that it makes one harmonious lifelike whole.</p>

    <p>You know that this was exactly the question mentioned in
    Gigoux's book, &ldquo;ne pas prendre par la ligne, mais par le
    milieu.&rdquo; [not tackle (it) from the contour, but from the
    centre.]</p>

    <p>Mantz says, &ldquo;Le model&eacute; est la probit&eacute; de
    l'art&rdquo; [The modelling is the probity of art] and what he
    changes in Ingres' words is that Ingres said, &ldquo;Le dessin
    est la probit&eacute; de l'art&rdquo; [The drawing is the
    probity of art]; and added, &ldquo;je voudrais marquer le
    contour d'un fil de fer.&rdquo; [I'd like to mark the contour
    with an iron wire.] H&eacute;bert had what he called
    &ldquo;l'horreur de la ligne.&rdquo; [the horror of the
    line.]</p>

    <p>And then again, there are people who assert that all dogmas
    are practically absurd. It is a pity that this is again a dogma
    in itself.</p>

    <p>The only thing to do is to go one's way, to try one's best,
    to make the thing live.</p>

    <p>If they hadn't made Thijs Maris too wretched and too
    melancholy to work, perhaps he would have found something
    wonderful.</p>

    <p>I think of that fellow so often, Theo, how marvellous his
    work is.</p>

    <p>It is as if he dreams - but what an artist he is!</p>

    <p>By God, if that fellow were now what he was when he began,
    what a centre he would become.</p>

    <p>For the present-day Dutch schools need some new blood.</p>

    <p>One must not work in &ldquo;thousand fears,&rdquo; and yet,
    that's what many do who are so anxious to get hold of the right
    colours and tones that their very anxiety makes them like tepid
    water. But the real artists, Isra&euml;ls or Maris or Mauve or
    Neuhuys, act quite differently, for they say, &ldquo;Just dash
    the colour on.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well - because they have suppressed all enthusiasm, they
    will &ldquo;faire hurler jusqu'aux chiens de
    &eacute;spoir&rdquo; [make people howl like dogs in despair],
    when nobody has any enthusiasm, and nobody has any daring left.
    We have not got that far, I know, but what I say is this, let's
    keep enthusiasm, otherwise we reach that summit of wisdom
    called <i>the time of the periwigs</i>. One has only to read
    the history of the old schools of painting to see that it often
    ends that way. How serious and bitter that fourth article of
    Mantz's was - the last one - and how exactly what is
    wanted.</p>

    <p>Please look for the Lhermittes when they appear. How
    beautiful they are.</p>

    <p>I just met Aunt C., who assured me that you would certainly
    still come this summer. About that time I shall have finished
    quite a few figures like those I have started now.</p>

    <p>Goodbye.</p>

    <p>Just another little word - I cannot advise you strongly
    enough to study for yourself Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix's
    different theories about colour.</p>

    <p>Though not up-to-date - though outside the art world for so
    long - banished because of my clogs, etc., yet I see, for
    instance from that article by Mantz, that even now there are
    connoisseurs and art lovers - <i>who know</i> something, the
    very thing Thor&eacute;, Th&eacute;ophile Gautier knew.</p>

    <p>And that leaving the so-called civilized world of progress
    for what it is, namely a <i>delusion</i>, the most important
    thing remains, what the reformers in the matter of taste in '48
    already proclaimed in a manly and vigorous way. Just as
    Isra&euml;ls will not be surpassed here in Holland, but, in my
    opinion, will remain the master.</p>

    <p>And in Belgium, Leys and De Groux.</p>

    <p>Please don't make the mistake of imagining that I want to
    insist on imitation, for that isn't at all what I mean.</p>

    <p>You have seen much more than I have, and I wish I had seen
    what you have seen and are still seeing every day. But perhaps
    the very fact of seeing so much makes it difficult to reflect,
    so be it.</p>

    <p>I only want to say that you, as well as many others, must
    refurbish and restudy the principles of art later in life.</p>

    <p>I mean that in your capacity of expert, you, just as the
    painters themselves - <i>in theory even better than they</i>,
    because you have to give advice and to speak about pictures in
    the making - must know certain rules about colours and
    perspective. Excuse me, but what I say is true, that this will
    perhaps be of more practical use to you than you may suppose,
    and would raise you above the ordinary level of art dealers -
    which is necessary, for the ordinary level is below the
    mark.</p>

    <p>From my own experience I know pretty well what art dealers
    do know and what they don't.</p>

    <p>I believe they are often taken in, and put over deals which
    they later regret, just because they know too little of how a
    picture is made. Well, but I know that you are already taking
    pains, for instance by reading good books like Gigoux's.</p>

    <p>Study that question of the colours, etc., carefully. I try
    to also, and I will gladly and thankfully read whatever you may
    find concerning it too. <label content="art.technique">At present I am busy putting into
    practice, on the drawing of a hand and an arm, what Delacroix
    said about drawing: &ldquo;Ne pas prendre par la ligne mais par
    le milieu.&rdquo; That gives opportunity enough to start from
    ellipses. And what I try to acquire is not to draw a
    <i>hand</i> but the <i>gesture</i>, not a mathematically
    correct head, but the general <i>expression</i>. For instance,
    when a digger looks up and sniffs the wind or speaks. In short,
    <i>life</i>.</label></p>
