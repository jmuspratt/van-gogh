  <body>
    <p>My dear Bernard,</p>

    <p>I don't know what I stuffed into my letter of yesterday
    instead of the enclosed sheet bearing on your last sonnet.<label content="health.fatigue"> The
    fact is that I am so worn out by work that in the evening,
    though writing is restful for me, I am like a machine out of
    gear, so much, on the other hand, has a day spent in the full
    sun tired me out.</label> That's why I stuffed another sheet into my
    letter instead of this one.</p>

    <p>Reading over yesterday's sheet, my Lord, I'm sending it to
    you just as it is, it seems legible to me, and so I'm sending
    it to you.</p>

    <p>A day of hard toil again today.</p>

    <p>If you saw my canvases, what would you say of them? You
    won't find the almost timid, conscientious brush stroke of
    C&eacute;zanne in them. But as I am now painting the same
    landscape, la Crau and Camargue - though at a slightly
    different spot - there may well remain certain connections in
    it in the matter of colour. What do I know about it? I couldn't
    help thinking of C&eacute;zanne from time to time, at exactly
    those moments when I realized how clumsy his touch in certain
    studies is - excuse the word clumsy - seeing that he probably
    did these studies when the mistral was blowing. As half the
    time I am faced with the same difficulty, I get an idea of why
    C&eacute;zanne's touch is sometimes so sure, whereas at other
    times it appears awkward. It's his easel that's reeling.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I have sometimes worked excessively fast. Is it a fault? I
    can't help it. For instance, I painted <art id=0465>a size 30 canvas, the
    &ldquo;Summer Evening&rdquo;</art> at a single sitting. Take it up again? - impossible;
    destroy it? - why should I! You see, I went out to do it expressly while the mistral was
    raging. Aren't we seeking intensity of thought rather than
    tranquillity of touch? But under the given conditions of
    working spontaneously, on the spot, and given the character of
    it, is a calm, well-regulated touch always possible? Goodness
    gracious - as little, it seems to me, as during an assault in a
    fencing match.</label></p>

    <p>I have sent your drawing to my brother, and urgently begged
    him to buy something from you. If my brother can do it, he
    will, for he well knows how keen I must be on your selling
    something.</p>

    <p>If you like, I will earmark for an exchange with you <art id=0423>the
    head of the Zouave</art> which I have painted. Only
    I won't speak of it unless I can let you sell something at the
    same time. It would be in response to your sketch of a brothel.
    If we two did a picture of a brothel, I feel sure that we would
    take my study of the Zouave for character. Ah! if only several
    painters agreed to collaborate on important things! The art of
    the future will show us examples of this perhaps. For the
    pictures that are <i>necessary</i> now, many would have to join
    hands in order to cope with the material difficulties. Alas! we
    haven't got as far as that yet; the art of painting doesn't
    move as fast as literature.</p>

    <p><label content="health.fatigue">Just like yesterday, I am writing you now in a great hurry,
    greatly exhausted, and I am also unable to draw at the moment,
    my capacity to do so having been utterly exhausted by a morning
    in the fields.</label></p>

    <p>How tired you get in the sun here! In the same way I am
    wholly unable to judge my own work. I cannot see whether the
    studies are good or bad. I have seven studies of wheat fields,
    all of them landscapes unfortunately, very much against my
    will. The landscapes yellow - old gold - done quickly, quickly,
    quickly and in a hurry, just like the harvester who is silent
    under the blazing sun, intent only on his reaping.</p>

    <p>I cannot help thinking that you may well be surprised to see
    how little I like the Bible, although I have often tried to
    study it a little. There is only that kernel, Christ, who seems
    superior to me from an artistic point of view, at any rate
    rather different from Greek, Indian, Egyptian, Persian
    antiquity, though they were so far advanced. But Christ, I
    repeat, is more of an artist than the artists; he works in the
    living spirit and the living flesh, he makes <i>men</i> instead
    of statues. And then&hellip;I feel only too well that I am an
    ox - being a painter - I, who admire the bull, the eagle, Man,
    with a veneration that will prevent me from being
    ambitious.</p>

    <p>A handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>P.S. As regards those sonnets, I add the explanation of what
    I mean by, their drawing is not very sure.</p>

    <p>At the end you produce morality. You tell Society that it is
    infamous, because the whore reminds us of meat in the market
    place. That's all right, the whore is like meat in a butcher's
    shop. I, though, having become a mere brute, I understand, I
    feel it, I rediscover a sensation in my own life; I say, That
    is well spoken - for the sonorous rhythm of the colourful words
    evoke for me with great intensity the brutal reality of the
    slums, but on <i>me, the brute</i>, the reproaches
    directed against society, such hollow words as &ldquo;le bon
    Dieu&rdquo; - the good God - no longer make any impression. I
    say, That isn't the real thing - and I sink back into my
    brutish state; I forget poetry, which was powerful enough at
    first to dispel my stupefaction.</p>

    <p>Is this true or not?</p>

    <p>Establishing facts, as you do in the beginning, is cutting
    with the scalpel as the surgeon does when he explains anatomy.
    I listen, attentively and full of interest, but when the
    dissecting surgeon later starts moralizing at me like that,
    then I don't think his final tirade has the same value as his
    demonstration.</p>

    <p>Studying, analyzing society means more than moralizing any
    time.</p>

    <p>Nothing would seem queerer to me than saying, for instance,
    Here is that meat from the market place; now observe how, in
    spite of everything, it may be electrified for a moment by the
    stimulus of a more refined and unexpected love.</p>

    <p>Just like the sated caterpillar that doesn't eat any more,
    that crawls on a wall instead of crawling on a cabbage leaf, so
    this sated female can no longer love, even if she does her
    best. She is seeking, seeking, seeking - does she herself know
    what? She is conscious, alive, sensitive, galvanized,
    rejuvenated for a moment - but impotent.</p>

    <p>Yet she can still love, so she is alive - here no
    prevarication is possible - although she may be finished and
    dying the death of a terrestrial beast. Where will this
    butterfly emerge from the chrysalis? This butterfly that was a
    sated caterpillar, this cockchafer that was a white grub?</p>

    <p>Well, this is where I have got to in my study of old whores.
    I too should like to know approximatively what I am the larva
    of myself, perhaps.</p>
