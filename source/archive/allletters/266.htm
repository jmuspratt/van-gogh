  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>Another Sunday, and so I am writing you again. Sometimes it
    seems to me that I didn't express warmly and cordially enough
    how much I was touched by what you recently told me. As to the
    question of whether an honest love might become &ldquo;une
    illusion perdue&rdquo; [a lost illusion], I do not doubt that
    it may sometimes happen; however, it would greatly astonish me
    if it should happen in your case, nor do I believe it will with
    me.</p>

    <p>Curiously enough, Michelet says that at first love is as
    frail as a spider's web, and grows to be as strong as a
    cable.</p>

    <p>But only on condition of faithfulness.</p>

    <p>I have often walked on the Geest recently, in those streets
    and alleys where I often walked with the woman last year, in
    the beginning. The weather was damp, everything was beautiful
    there, and when I came home, I said to the woman, &ldquo;It is
    still just the same as last year.&rdquo; I tell you this
    because you spoke of disenchantment; no, no, it is true there
    is a withering and budding in love as in nature, but nothing
    dies entirely. It is true there is an ebb and flow, but the sea
    remains the sea. And in love, either for a woman or for art,
    there are times of exhaustion and impotence, but there is no
    permanent disenchantment.</p>

    <p>I consider love as well as friendship not just a feeling but
    also a positive action, and as such it requires doing things
    and exerting oneself, and exhaustion and impotence are the
    consequences.</p>

    <p>A sincere and true love is a blessing, I think, though that
    doesn't prevent occasional hard times.</p>

    <p><label content="health.eyes">I am glad that my eyes are no worse, rather a little better,
    but it is not quite over yet and I must be careful. I can tell
    you, it was quite upsetting. </label>How I should love to talk with you
    - for I am not discouraged about the work, nor listless nor
    disheartened, but I am at a standstill, and that is, perhaps,
    because I ought to have some intercourse with someone who is
    sympathetic to me and whom I could talk to about it; right now
    there is not a soul here whom I can confide in. <i>I do not
    mean that nobody can be trusted</i>, far from it, but
    unfortunately I am not in touch with them. I sometimes think of
    years ago when I came to The Hague for the first time, and of
    the three years I spent at Goupil and Co.; the first two were
    rather unpleasant, but the last one was much happier, so who
    knows whether the same won't happen now?</p>

    <p>I like the proverb, &ldquo;When things are at their worst,
    they are sure to mend,&rdquo; but now and then I ask myself,
    &ldquo;Haven't we by any chance reached the worst?&rdquo; for
    the &ldquo;mending&rdquo; would not be at all unwelcome to me.
    Well, we'll see.</p>

    <p>Lately I read Le Peuple by Michelet, or rather I read it
    some time ago this winter, but recently I was strongly reminded
    of it. That book was written quickly, and apparently in a
    hurry, and if it were the only one of Michelet's books one
    read, one wouldn't think it very good, and wouldn't be struck
    by it. But knowing his more polished works, La Femme, L'Amour,
    La Mer, and Histoire de la R&eacute;volution, I thought this
    one like the rough sketch of a painter whom I like very much,
    and, as such, it had a peculiar charm. To me Michelet's style
    is enviable. I don't doubt that there will be many authors who
    disapprove of Michelet's technique, as there are some painters
    who think they have the right to find fault with Isra&euml;ls'
    technique. Michelet has strong emotions, and he smears what he
    feels onto paper without caring in the least how he does it,
    and without giving the slightest thought to technique or
    conventional forms - just shaping it into any form that can be
    understood by those who want to understand it. To me Le Peuple
    is not so much a first idea or impression as an unfinished but
    well-thought-out and studied conception. Some parts are
    apparently done hurriedly from nature and joined to other parts
    which are more finished and studied.</p>

    <p>De Bock seems to be in very flourishing circumstances,
    judging from his fur coat. I hadn't seen him for months, but
    met him a few days ago in the above-mentioned beautiful fur
    coat. Yet I cannot say he himself looked flourishing. Have you
    ever felt sympathetic to a person whom you <i>saw</i> was
    unhappy, but who pretended and was considered to be
    flourishing; and have you felt in your heart, If I tried to be
    friends with him, he would either think that I was making fun
    of him and it would be almost impossible to gain his confidence
    or his friendship - or if I got that far, he would still say,
    &ldquo;I have chosen my course, and will stick to it,&rdquo;
    and we should have no influence on each other. This is the way
    I think of De Bock, and though I feel a real sympathy for him
    and admire much of his work, I do not think that he and I would
    profit by each other's society, especially as we have
    diametrically different views of life, and of art too. It is
    sometimes difficult for me to give up a friendship, but if I go
    into a studio and have to think, Talk about inane things, don't
    mention anything of importance and don't express your real
    feeling about art - that would make me more melancholy than if
    I stayed away altogether. Just because I should like to find
    and keep up a real friendship, it is difficult for me to
    conform to a conventional friendship.</p>

    <p>If there is a desire to be friendly <i>on both sides</i>,
    there may be some difference of opinion, but for all that, one
    doesn't fall out so easily, and if one does, it is easily made
    up. Where it is conventional, bitterness is almost unavoidable,
    just because one does not feel free, and even though one
    doesn't express one's real feelings, they are sufficiently
    apparent to leave a continuing disagreeable impression on both
    sides and to make it hopeless for one to profit from the
    other's society. Where there is conventional, there is
    mistrust, and mistrust gives rise to all kinds of intrigues.
    And with a little more mutual sincerity, our lives would be so
    much easier.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, one gets used to things as they are, but it is
    not normal, and if it were possible to go back suddenly to the
    period of thirty, forty or fifty years ago, I think one would
    feel more at home in that period than in the present one - that
    is to say, you and I, for instance, would feel more at home in
    it. I don't think anyone would want to go back to <i>this</i>
    period fifty years from now, for if a time of antiquated decay
    or a time of &ldquo;periwigs and crinolines&rdquo; follows,
    people will be too dull to think about it, and if there is a
    change for the better, tant mieux.</p>

    <p>I do not think it absurd to expect that such a time of
    stagnation may arrive, for what is called &ldquo;the period of
    periwigs and crinolines&rdquo; in Dutch history also had its
    origin in the relinquishment of principles and the substitution
    of the conventional for the original. At their best the Dutch
    people are Rembrandt's &ldquo;Syndics,&rdquo; but if the salt
    loses its savour, a time of stagnation follows, of
    &ldquo;periwigs&rdquo; - not immediately, but history proves
    that it may.</p>

    <p>It is sometimes hard for me to believe that a period of, for
    instance, only fifty years is sufficient to bring about such a
    total change that <i>everything</i> is the other way around.
    But just by reflecting on history one learns to see those
    relatively quick and continual changes; from it I conclude that
    every man weighs the scale somewhat, no matter how little, and
    that how one thinks and acts does make a difference. The battle
    is but short, and sincerity is worth while. If many are sincere
    and firm, the whole period becomes good - at least,
    energetic.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">Yes, I often think of what you wrote me recently. I think
    there must be a great difference between the woman you met and
    the one I have already lived with for a full year, but what
    they have in common is their misfortune and their sex.</label></p>

    <p>Don't you also think that if one meets someone in such a way
    - I mean, so weak and defenseless - something makes one
    surrender completely, so that one cannot imagine ever being
    able to desert such a person? Generally speaking, such an
    encounter is an apparition. Have you read Erckmann-Chatrian's
    Madame Th&eacute;r&egrave;se? It has a description of a woman
    who is recovering - very touching and beautiful; it is a simple
    book, but at the same time, deep.</p>

    <p>If you don't know Madame Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, do read it.
    I think she will like it too, and be touched by it.</p>

    <p>At times I regret that the woman with whom I live
    understands neither books nor art. But (though she definitely
    can't) doesn't my still being so attached to her prove that
    there is something sincere between us? Perhaps she will learn
    later on, and it may strengthen the bond between us; but now,
    with the children, you will understand that she has her hands
    full already. And especially because of the children she comes
    into contact with reality, and involuntarily she learns. Books
    and reality and art are alike to me. Somebody out of touch with
    real life would bore me, but somebody right in the midst of it
    knows and feels naturally.</p>

    <p>If I did not look for art in reality, I should probably find
    her stupid; as it is I only wish it were otherwise, but after
    all I am contented with things as they are.</p>

    <p>I hope to be able to work regularly again this week. I feel
    so strongly that I must work doubly hard to make up for my
    having started so late; it is the feeling that I am behind
    because of my age which worries me.</p>

    <p>These days Montmartre will have those curious effects which
    Michel, for instance, has painted; that dry, withered grass and
    the sand against a grey sky. At least at present the colour in
    the meadows often reminds me of Michel, the soil,
    yellowish-brown; withered grass with a muddy road full of
    puddles; black tree trunks; a greyish-white sky; the houses at
    a distance subdued, but with the red roofs lending a little
    touch of colour.</p>

    <p>Those effects are striking enough, and Michel's secret (like
    Weissenbruch's) depends on taking the proper measurements and
    finding the correct proportion of the foreground to the
    background, and feeling the exact direction in which the
    perspective lines run. These things are no accident (Michel's
    works are plentiful enough, and I see clearly from them that he
    had reached such a height that it seemed like child's play to
    him), it is a <i>science</i>, and I think that before he
    succeeded, Michel must have been perplexed and disappointed
    sometimes because things <i>wouldn't go right</i>.</p>

    <p>Simple though it may seem, there is a very extensive general
    science behind it all, as there is behind even more
    simple-looking works, Daumier's, for instance.</p>

    <p>Well, I must finish this letter. Write soon, if you haven't
    already. I am longing to hear whether your patient has had any
    serious consequences of the operation. Isn't it curious that in
    the very first letter I had from Rappard after his illness, he
    again talks with great animation of some wood engravings he has
    found, including some of Lan&ccedil;on's? he is now so eager
    for them that I need not urge him on, and at first he cared for
    them as little as others do. He is getting a very good
    collection, and I think I see the influence of those same
    Englishmen in his work and intentions - though, of course, he
    is far from imitating them in the slightest. But, for instance,
    the fact that before his illness he went to make studies in the
    asylum for the blind is the direct practical result of his love
    for draughtsmen like Herkomer or Frank Holl.</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, write soon. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
