  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Just a little word to tell you I received your letter and to
    thank you for it.</p>

    <p>And I was very glad to hear the good news about your
    patient. That's good.</p>

    <p>In every love there are many different loves - and when the
    woman recovers, it will be quite different again - and that is
    something delightful, too. The principal thing is to continue
    and to persevere, he who wants variety must remain faithful.
    And he who wants to know many women must stick to one and the
    same.</p>

    <p>Spring is coming fast here.</p>

    <p>For the moment the studio is in a terrible mess.</p>

    <p>Enclosed is a little scratch, made in a hurry, on a scrap of
    paper, while they were putting up the shutters I mentioned. Why
    am I sending it to you, unimportant as it is, in its unfinished
    condition? Because I believe you will see one thing clearly
    from it, that now I can get a quite different light effect in
    my studio than the too-strong light of those three large
    windows.</p>

    <p>The lower part of window Number 1 in the scratch is closed,
    and the rest, partly so - now it looks like the door of a
    little room in an almshouse, for instance.</p>

    <p>Window Number 2 is closed at the top, and looks like a
    little window which the figures are sitting by.</p>

    <p>The background to the left is dark, for window Number 3 is
    completely closed.</p>

    <p>Just think of the difference between the effect of the crude
    light which the three windows would be letting in at this
    moment if they weren't shuttered, and you will understand how
    infinitely better I can work now. Besides the glaring light,
    there used to be an enormous reflection which neutralized all
    effects.</p>

    <p>It often made me desperate, when, for instance, I saw a
    woman puttering around a small room and found something typical
    and mysterious in the figure, which absolutely disappeared when
    I had the same woman in the studio. Thus the old man was also
    much more striking in a dark passage than in my studio.</p>

    <p>And it was very aggravating, and the space the three windows
    took up was so large that the light couldn't be dimmed
    sufficiently by screens or cardboard.</p>

    <p>But now I am going to overcome all that.</p>

    <p>However indistinct the little sketch may be, it has been
    done from nature, in a great hurry, while they were working on
    the window; and from it you will see that one can now get fine
    effects, and vary them greatly. I am sending you this rather
    than explain the thing in words.</p>

    <p>Well, now the light in the studio is somewhat under my
    control, and when I have seen a little figure in some other
    house, I can easily reconstruct the effect back home if I pay
    attention to the way the light strikes it, and regulate my
    light accordingly. How much light was there? Did it strike the
    figure in front, from behind, to the right or left, from above
    or from below?</p>

    <p>I think it will please you when you come. The closet is also
    excellent. It has been a rather difficult job, as the shutters
    were too large for the windows and had to be cut down. But now
    everything is finished so far, and only now can I really enjoy
    the studio, and it is, in fact, in keeping with what I want.
    Later on, perhaps, they will make me another little room in the
    attic - when there is some leftover lumber again. They could
    make quite a picturesque and intriguing little room there, but
    it is of secondary importance.</p>

    <p>But the studio is ten times better.</p>

    <p>However, the expenses have been rather more than I expected,
    as so much of the old shutters had to be altered.</p>

    <p>Therefore I must ask you, as I have promised a payment on
    the first of March - if you can, send it a day sooner rather
    than later. I know you will understand that the studio has been
    quite changed by it; oh, I am so delighted with it - it has
    worried me so because I couldn't get it right.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">I mentioned the good news about your patient, but her
    wanting to go back to her own country doesn't seem quite right
    to me; but as you say, little can be said about the future
    before she has recovered. May spring do her good!</label></p>

    <p>Well, boy, I am writing in a hurry, as I still have a great
    deal of cleaning up to do; I am so very happy about that
    improvement in the windows.</p>

    <p>As far as I can tell, it is quite effective. You will
    remember from your visit last summer that the light was too
    crude, and couldn't be changed. From this little sketch you
    will probably see how it can be varied infinitely, and that the
    effects one sees in little houses can be reproduced here. And
    the special advantage is that in the small houses one can't get
    the right distance for drawing the figures, and in the studio,
    one can.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a firm handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I think tonight I shall probably dream of fellows in
    sou'westers and oilskins, on which the light falls and makes
    piquant highlights, accentuating the shape.</p>
