  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Just a word in haste. Did you receive the drawings and my
    last letter? I mean the portfolio containing the large
    &ldquo;Sorrow&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Roots,&rdquo; etc.</p>

    <p>I hear that Uncle Vincent is in Paris; I hope you did not
    speak to him about the matter in question. Of course they would
    consider it &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; or even worse. All right,
    they can chatter about it as much as they like as long as I
    don't have to listen to it or be present.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I received a kind letter from Father and Mother,
    which would please me very much if only I could believe that
    this feeling would continue. But when I speak to them about the
    affair with Christine (which I shall certainly do in three
    weeks, when she has gone to Leyden and I have the time to
    spare, but not before), then, I repeat, will they still speak
    kindly when they know all this???</p>

    <p>But my marriage does not depend on them, and you know well
    enough what I think in this matter, and that as I do nothing
    unlawful, and as I doubt their competence to judge moral
    affairs, their refusal would certainly grieve me, but it would
    not stop me or give me pause.</p>

    <p>I am again busy with the drawings for C. M. but will they
    please him? Perhaps not. I can conceive such drawings only as
    studies in perspective, and I am doing them especially for
    practice.</p>

    <p>Even if he does not take them, I shall not be sorry for the
    trouble they gave me, because I should like to keep them
    myself, and because I practiced the elements which so much
    depends on: perspective and proportion.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">During the last fortnight I have been weak, not feeling well
    at all; I haven't given in to it and have gone on with my work.
    But, for instance, I have not been able to sleep for several
    nights, and have been feverish and nervous. But I force myself
    to keep going and working, for this is no time to get sick. I
    must go on.</label></p>

    <p>Christine and her mother moved to a smaller house because
    when Christine returns from Leyden she will come to live with
    me, wherever I may be, either in better or in worse
    circumstances. It is <art id=941>a little house with a courtyard</art>; I hope to
    make <art id=942>a drawing of it this week</art>.</p>

    <p>Every day I see more clearly that the step I am taking opens
    an interesting field for drawing and getting models. This must
    also be taken into account when judging me. My profession
    allows me to undertake this marriage - I could not do it if I
    had another position.</p>

    <p>I am longing for your letter, and hope you will soon find
    time to write. I think, knowing how things are, you could do
    much to straighten matters out (and if you want more
    information, I will give it to you gladly and honestly); I
    repeat, knowing how things are, you will be able to moderate
    and change the opinions of those who have only a very imperfect
    notion of the matter, and so disagreements will be avoided. For
    you understand that I want to avoid all disagreement, gossip
    and quarrels as much as possible; I spoke to no one but you
    about it, for the sake of peace, and I shall not do it more
    than is absolutely necessary - as, for instance, to Father when
    the time has come for Christine to go to Leyden.</p>

    <p>This is nothing I have sought, but it has come across my
    path and I have tackled it, and I am glad that it is something
    which demands action without hesitation or reflection. And I
    showed you the darkest side of it first, in the hope that later
    on you won't think it's so bad.</p>

    <p>But I wish I knew what to do about the studio I wrote you
    about. I would be content with a smaller house, but I do not
    know of one more suitable. And I am afraid that a less suitable
    one would not be cheaper because then my work would suffer,
    though I should save a few guilders a month by paying less
    rent. And perhaps I should say later, Why did I let that studio
    go? Why didn't I try harder to get it?</p>

    <p>I long for your coming even more than for your letter, but I
    understand that perhaps I shall have to wait some time still. I
    am not in a mood for writing, but one must do it sometimes. It
    would be good if you could send me something, for I am rather
    hard up. Well, at all events write soon. I should especially
    like to know your opinion about the studio. It may be gone any
    day. Adieu, I repeat, don't deprive yourself, but if possible
    send me something.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>And let me know if you have received the drawings.</p>
