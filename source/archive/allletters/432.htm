    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Would it greatly amaze you - let's suppose those at home
    intend to move between March and May next - would it greatly
    amaze you if something happened to Mother before that time? Now
    and then this thought occurs to me when I go there. I have the
    impression that lately there has been a change.
    &ldquo;Aging&rdquo; is such a strange thing, and it is
    absolutely certain that there are many cases of a wife's not
    outliving her husband by long. The change I observed is that at
    times Mother's thoughts are more lucid, whereas during these
    last months there were long periods when they seemed more or
    less fuzzy - which is really not to be wondered at. For a time
    thee was something overwrought in her, due to - at least so I
    imagine - the void around her and the feeling of
    loneliness.</p>

    <p>Now <i>it struck me</i> that she has turned quite calm and
    collected - something resolute has taken the place of the
    worrying. Nothing more is to be <i>seen</i>.</p>

    <p>I do not think it <i>impossible</i> that to her too death
    may come unexpectedly and softly, just as it came to Father,
    and for a similar reason. Seeing that I was struck by it - and
    because Wil, when I discussed it with her, told me that she had
    also observed that Mother was changing a great deal, and that
    it made her uneasy too - I am writing to let you know.</p>

    <p>For the rest, however, one might say that Mother is looking
    <i>particularly well</i>. But there is something that makes me
    think of what I told you. I don't think it would be a bad idea
    at all if Mother made a few trips shortly, to Anna, to
    Amsterdam, to Cor - especially as she seems to be resolved on
    it and to long to see them all once more. But it might well be
    that she herself has a presentiment that at the same time it
    will be a leave-taking.</p>

    <p>This month I had to pay my rent, and at the same time I gave
    notice that I shall leave my studio toward May. Its drawback
    is, as you know, that I am greatly handicapped by the
    neighbours, and I notice that people are still afraid of the
    priest, though perhaps he wouldn't meddle any further. But
    since there has been trouble once, the best thing is a radical
    change.</p>

    <p>The last thing I painted is rather big; it's an old mill on
    the barren heath, a dark silhouette against an evening sky.</p>

    <p>Now this is an uneasiness that I arrived at on my own,
    however, to such a degree that I feel obliged to inform you of
    it. But as Mother goes to see Van der Loo from time to time, we
    may expect him to warn us if there is anything to be warned of.
    But if it should be a passing similar to Father's, that is to
    say, sudden, it is equally possible that it will happen within
    a few days as within a few years. So - who can tell? If the
    lucidity and the calm persist, I personally expect a crisis
    after the trip, that is, within a short time - and dying
    without a struggle. But sometimes it happens that the mind gets
    a little clouded, then things drag on, and then it may still be
    necessary to struggle through much suffering and worry. Please
    think over whether I am not right in setting the two chances
    against each other: either an early death without suffering or
    the other thing.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
