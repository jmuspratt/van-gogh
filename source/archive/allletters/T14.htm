    <p>Letter T14 <sup>1</sup><br>
     Paris, 4 August 1889</p>

    <p>Dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I thought it so strange not to get a letter from you that I
    telegraphed in order to learn if you were well.<label content="health.general"> Dr. Peyron
    answered me in a letter that you have been ill for a day or
    two, but that you are already recovering a bit. Poor fellow,
    how dearly I should like to know what to do to put a stop to
    this nightmare.</label> When your letter did not come to hand, I had an
    idea, I don't know why, that you were travelling to us, and
    that you would come and give us a surprise. If you should ever
    think it might do you good to be among people who would be glad
    to do their utmost to give you some stimulus, and who would
    love to have you with them, please remember our little guest
    room. It was inaugurated the other day by Jo's mother, so it
    has proved itself habitable. I hope that this indisposition is
    nothing but an aftereffect of the last crisis, but if you
    ascribe this relapse to something special, do inform me of it
    in any case. Are the doctor and the rest of the staff good to
    you? Do they make any distinction between the various patients,
    or does this depend on what they pay?</p>

    <p>If one is uneasy in one's mind, one is apt to see things in
    a different and worse light, so please write as soon as you
    can, if only a word or two. I do not think I worry more than
    necessary, but I hope nevertheless that you will tell me
    everything. All is well with us, and I feel a lot better than I
    did some time ago, and my cough is entirely gone now, thanks to
    Rivet's remedies.</p>

    <p>In your last letter you wrote me that we were brothers for
    more than one reason. This is what I feel too, and though my
    heart is not as sensitive as yours, I can enter at times into
    your feeling of being smothered by so many thoughts that cannot
    be resolved. Never lose courage, and remember how much I want
    you.</p>

    <p>Jo cordially wishes you a speedy recovery. I hope you will
    be able to give good news about yourself soon.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>

        its being read by others</p>
