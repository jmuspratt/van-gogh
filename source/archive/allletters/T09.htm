    <p>Letter T09<br>
     Paris, 22 May 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter; Jo too is very pleased with the
    one you wrote her. <sup>1</sup> We hear with pleasure that your
    trip to St. R&eacute;my was accomplished without a hitch,
    and that your stay there will not last very long, for it can
    hardly be pleasant to be near so many lunatics. What I should
    like is to be able to find people somewhere who would be able
    to take care of you, and would leave you entirely at liberty
    otherwise. Surely something like this might be found. If you
    don't have such a dread of going back to Paris or its environs,
    I myself would try to find a boarding house of this kind.</p>

    <p>Please tell us in your next letter what you think of the
    establishment where you are now staying. How are you treated,
    do you get enough food, and what is the behaviour of the people
    you have to do with? Do you see anything of the countryside?
    Above all, don't harass yourself, either physically or
    mentally, because for the moment it is better to do everything
    in your power to regain your strength. Working will come of
    itself after that.</p>

    <p>Some days ago I got your consignment, which is very
    important; there are superb things in it. Everything arrived in
    good condition and without any damage. <art id=0508>The cradle</art>,
    the portrait of Roulin, <art id=0450>the little sower with the tree</art>,
    the baby, <art id=0474>the starry night</art>, the sunflowers and
    <art id=0498>the chair with the pipe and tobacco pouch</art> are
    the ones I prefer so far.</p>

    <p>The first two are very curious. Certainly there is none of
    the beauty which is taught officially in them, but they have
    something so striking and so near to truth. Who can tell
    whether we are more in the right than the simple people who buy
    pictures with glaring colours? Or rather, isn't it a fact that
    the charm they see in them is also an inspired sensation, as
    much as that of the pretentious fellows who look at pictures in
    museums? Now there is in your canvases a vigour which one
    certainly does not find in the chromos; in the course of time
    they will become very beautiful by reason of the settling of
    the layers of paint and they will undoubtedly be appreciated
    someday. When we see that the Pissarros, the Gauguins, the
    Renoirs, the Guillaumins do not sell, one ought to be almost
    glad of not having the public's favour, seeing that those who
    have it now will not have it forever, and it is quite possible
    that times will change very shortly. If you could see how
    feeble the Salon and the Universal Exhibition are with regard
    to the pictures, I think you would be of the opinion that they
    will not last much longer. The Dutch school cuts a very good
    figure beside them.</p>

    <p>There are two watercolours by J.H. Weissenbruch which I am
    particularly fond of, also pieces by Willem and Jacob Maris and
    Bosboom, Isra&Atilde;&laquo;ls and Breitner. One of the
    Weissenbruchs is a mill on the bank of a canal, a blue sky with
    a little cloud hiding the sun. The other is a canal at night
    with boats in the moonlight. He is a thundering good artist,
    that one, but Tersteeg says he isn't saleable.</p>

    <p>Not long ago I saw Gauguin, who is now working at sculpting.
    Within a short time he will go to Pont-Aven, where De Haan is
    staying already. It seems that before long there will be an
    exhibition of the Independents; I should like very much to know
    what you think of it, and which canvases you think are most
    suitable to be shown. I hear tell that everyone can exhibit
    four canvases, as there is not enough room to admit more.</p>

    <p>I shall write again soon, and you write me too if you are
    feeling well A cordial handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
