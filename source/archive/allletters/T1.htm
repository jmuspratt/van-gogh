    <p>Letter T 1<br>
     Paris, 19 October 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>It was really a rather serious omission on my part to have
    talked to you about De Haan and Isa&auml;cson without
    mentioning what they have done up to now. <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Above all I wanted to give you an idea of the kind of
    fellows they are. I have not seen the large picture; but,
    judging from a photograph taken of a preliminary sketch, I
    think it cannot be at all bad. The subject is Uriel Acoste
    <sup>2</sup> before a Tribunal; it was a judicial crime in
    Jewish history. The composition is nothing like Rembrandt, as
    the light is not concentrated in one part of the picture, but
    for all that spread effectively all over it. Since the costumes
    belong to that epoch it has been said that it is a bad
    imitation of Rembrandt. It is certain that he was influenced by
    the latter, but notwithstanding this there is quite a personal
    quality in the work of his which I have seen to be found in the
    way he spreads his light all over his picture or drawing. The
    things I have seen were mainly charcoal drawings, their other
    work having been left behind in Holland. I am sending you two
    photographs of drawings, so that you will be able to judge for
    yourself; the photographs have turned out rather badly, for the
    drawings are a bit dim.</p>

    <p>They look upon Breitner as one of the most vigorous of the
    modern Dutchmen; I don't think they place him above J. Maris,
    but they certainly do place him above Isra&euml;ls. I believe
    that if you knew them, you would share my opinion that there is
    no reason to distrust them. I haven't seen anything of
    Isa&auml;cson's yet except his sketches, which are very well
    done and highly original. He is waiting for drawings which are
    to be sent back from London. Seurat isn't back in town yet, and
    I don't know what he's doing. He is very vigorous, that fellow,
    and I quite agree with you that his frames calculated to suit
    the picture are worth more than all kinds of expensive
    frames.</p>

    <p>A short while ago I read Tartarin of Tarascon, which I think
    fine, and his Nabob, which I like much less. I am also going to
    read the other Tartarin. They don't have Madame
    Chrysanth&egrave;me in the library, but someone promised to let
    me have it, so that I may read it. I am quite eager to know it.
    <label content="health.eyes">It is very annoying that you have been having trouble with your
    eyes. What can be the cause of that?</label></p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">So Gauguin is going to join you; it will mean a great change
    in your life. I hope that your project of turning the house
    into a refuge, where artists will feel at home, will be
    successful.</label></p>

    <p>I'll stop now, for otherwise, the letter will not go off
    tonight.</p>

    <p>Cordially yours, Theo</p>

        <p>Uriel Acosta, originally Gabriel da Costa (c.
        1591-1641), a Dutch Jew of Spanish origin, a philosopher
        and free-thinker, excommunicated and declared a heretic by
        a Rabbinical Court at Venice in 1624, and excommunicated by
        the Portuguese-Jewish Community of Amsterdam in 1623 and
        again in 1633. He committed suicide.</p>
