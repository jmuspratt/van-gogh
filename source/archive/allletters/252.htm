  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I just received your registered letter and thank you warmly
    for it. I want to begin with the following. I enclose a copy of
    the Graphic, Christmas, 1882.</p>

    <p>Read it carefully, it is worth while.</p>

    <p>What a colossal institution, isn't it, what an enormous
    circulation. This much stated, what else?&hellip;Among other
    things, that Hubert Herkomer's words contrast strangely with
    those of the Graphic editors. The latter say: &ldquo;Checking
    our books, we find that besides our professional artists, we
    have no less than 2730 friends scattered all over the world,
    sending us sketches or elaborate drawings.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>H. Herkomer speaks of a &ldquo;shortage of good
    draughtsmen.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And in general his words are exactly the opposite of those
    of the editors of the Christmas issue in question, the result
    being something like this:</p>

    <p>The Graphic editors say, &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>H. Herkomer says, &ldquo;All wrong.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Now you will find something striking on page four of the
    copy I sent: When strong enough to stand on its own feet, the
    Graphic rented a house and began to print with six
    machines.</p>

    <p>I have full respect for this; here I feel something holy,
    something noble, something sublime. Then look at that group of
    great artists, and think of foggy London and the bustle in that
    small workshop. Moreover, I see in my imagination the
    draughtsmen in their several studios, starting their work with
    the best enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>I see Millais running to Charles Dickens with the first
    issue of the Graphic. Dickens was then in the evening of his
    life, he had a paralyzed foot and walked with a kind of crutch.
    Millais says that while showing him Luke Fildes's drawing
    &ldquo;Homeless and Hungry,&rdquo; of poor people and tramps in
    front of a free overnight shelter, Millais said to Dickens,
    &ldquo;Give him your Edwin Drood to illustrate,&rdquo; and
    Dickens said, &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Edwin Drood was Dickens's last work, and Luke Fildes,
    brought into contact with Dickens through those small
    illustrations, entered his room on the day of his death, and
    saw his empty chair; and so it happened that one of the old
    numbers of the Graphic contained that touching drawing,
    <art id=mptychair>&ldquo;The Empty Chair.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>Empty chairs - there are many of them, there will be even
    more, and sooner or later there will be nothing but empty
    chairs in place of Herkomer, Luke Fildes, Frank Holl, William
    Small, etc. And yet the publishers and dealers, not listening
    to a prophecy like that of H. Herkomer's, will continue to
    assure us, in the same terms as in the enclosed number, that
    everything is all right, that we are getting on famously.</p>

    <p>But how hard-hearted they are, how mistaken they are, if
    they think they can make everybody believe that material
    grandeur outweighs moral grandeur, and that any good can be
    accomplished without the latter.</p>

    <p>It is the same with the Graphic as it is with many other
    things in the realm of art. Moral grandeur dwindles, material
    grandeur supersedes. But will the much-desired change come? I
    think that everybody must find that out for himself, but the
    old parable mentions a broad way which leads to destruction,
    and a narrow path which leads to another result</p>

    <p>The Graphic started on the narrow path, has now passed to
    the broad one. This morning I saw the last number, there wasn't
    a <i>single</i> good thing in it; this morning I took an old,
    dirty torn number of 1873 from a bundle of waste-paper at a
    bookstall, and <i>almost everything</i> in it is worth
    keeping.</p>

    <p>But as to me - que faire?</p>

    <p>A few years ago Rappard and I walked outside Brussels on a
    spot which they call la Vall&eacute; Josaphat, in the
    neighborhood where Roelofs, among others, lives. At that time
    there was a sand quarry where diggers were at work, there were
    women looking for dandelion leaves, a farmer was sowing; we
    looked at all that, and I was almost in despair then:
    &ldquo;Shall I ever succeed in painting what I admire so
    much?&rdquo; Now I no longer despair, now I can capture those
    farmers and women better; and working on with patience, I can
    now succeed to a certain extent. But I am sorely oppressed by
    the way things are going and can no longer think of those
    magazines with pleasure and enthusiasm. The Graphic neglects to
    say that many in the group of artists refuse to give their
    work, and withdraw more and more. Why? because a painter paints
    to do some good and has some sincerity in his heart which
    despises all that grandeur. What more shall I say?&hellip; I
    can only repeat, &ldquo;Que faire!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Of course, continue to work, but conscious of a dark
    future.</p>

    <p>Here in The Hague there are clever, great men, I readily
    admit it; but in many respects what a miserable state of
    affairs - what intrigues, what quarrels, what jealousy. And in
    the personality of the successful artists who, with Mesdag at
    their head, set the tone, material grandeur is unmistakably
    substituted for moral grandeur.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I am beginning to feel that if I went, for instance, to
    England, if I made every effort, I should certainly have a
    chance of finding a job.</label></p>

    <p>My ideal was to achieve this, and, after all, it still is;
    this was what enabled me to surmount the enormous difficulties
    in the beginning. But my heart gets heavy at times when I think
    of the way things are going, it's not so much fun any more. Of
    course, I love to do my best on the drawings, but to present
    myself at all those publishers' offices - oh, I hate the
    thought of it!</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">You ask about my
    health - last summer's trouble is really
    quite gone,</label><label content="psychology.depression">
    but I feel rather depressed at present, </label>whereas at
    other moments, when my work progresses well, I am quite
    cheerful, and feel kind of like a soldier who isn't at home in
    the guardhouse, and argues thus to himself, &ldquo;Why must I
    be in prison here, when I should be much better off among the
    rank and file where I belong?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I mean, I feel depressed because I have a strength in me
    which circumstances prevent from developing as well as it
    could; the result is that I often feel miserable. A kind of
    internal struggle about what I must do - which is not as easy
    to solve as might seem at first.</p>

    <p>I wish I had a job which would help me make progress. Many
    jobs which might possibly be within my reach would lead me to
    things quite different from those I aim at. These jobs are out
    of my reach, for though I might be accepted at first, they
    would not be satisfied with me in the long run; they would fire
    me or I would leave of my own accord, as at Goupil's.</p>

    <p>I mean, they would demand current events, topics of the day,
    which people like Adrien, Marie, or Godefroid Durand make to
    perfection. I begin to see more and more clearly that the
    magazines drift with the superficial tide, and I think they do
    not try to be as good as they ought to be. No, to fill the
    magazines with things which cost neither time nor trouble, to
    give a good thing now and then, but reproduced in a cheap,
    mechanical way, further, to make as much money as possible -
    this is what they do.</p>

    <p>I do not think this method wise. I think it will make them
    go bankrupt, and they will bitterly regret it in the end, which
    may still be far away, but nevertheless, things are as they
    are. They do not think of renewing themselves. Suppose the
    Graphic, Illustration, or Vie Moderne published an issue full
    of dull, insignificant things - they'd still sell it by the
    carload, and by the boatload; the managers would rub their
    hands and say, &ldquo;It sells just as well this way; who's the
    wiser - they swallow it anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Yes, but if their lordships the managers could follow their
    publications and see how thousands take the paper up greedily,
    and then, when they put it down, involuntarily have a feeling
    of dissatisfaction and disappointment, perhaps their frenzy for
    current events would abate somewhat.</p>

    <p>However, this is by no means the case; as you see from the
    report in the Graphic, they do not lack self-confidence.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, people intrude themselves, as employees,
    who would never have been accepted in the difficult but noble
    days. It is what Zola calls &ldquo;triomphe de la
    m&eacute;diocrit&eacute;.&rdquo; Snobs, nobodies, take the
    place of workers, thinkers, artists; and it isn't even
    noticed.</p>

    <p>The public, yes, one part of it is dissatisfied, but
    material grandeur also finds applause; however, do not forget
    that this is merely a straw-fire, and that those who applaud
    generally do so only because it has become the fashion. But on
    the day after the banquet, there will be a void - a silence and
    indifference after all that noise.</p>

    <p>The Graphic will give &ldquo;Types of Beauty&rdquo; (large
    heads of women), as this prospectus says - I dare say to take
    the place of &ldquo;Heads of the People&rdquo; by Herkomer,
    Small and Ridley.</p>

    <p>All right, but some people will not admire the &ldquo;Types
    of Beauty&rdquo; and will remember the old &ldquo;Heads of the
    People&rdquo; with sadness (this series has been stopped).</p>

    <p>The Graphic says they will make <i>chromos</i>!!! Give us
    back Swain's studio.</p>

    <p>Look here, Theo boy, it cuts me to the heart, things are
    going wrong. You know I would have counted it the highest
    honour - an ideal, in fact - to contribute to what the Graphic
    started. The sublime beginning of the Graphic was something
    like what Dickens was as an author, what the Household Edition
    of his work was as a publication.</p>

    <p>And now everything is gone - once again materialism instead
    of moral principle. Do you know what I think of the copy I'm
    sending you? It is just like Obach's kind of talk, for
    instance, the manager of Goupil and Co. in London. And it has
    success, <i>yes, that has success, yes, that is listened to and
    that is admired</i>. Do you know, boy, what I think of this
    number of the Graphic? It is something like Mesdag's talk about
    his panorama. I respect all kinds of work, I despise neither
    Obach nor Mesdag, but there are things which I rank infinitely
    higher than that kind of energy.</p>

    <p>I want something more concise, more simple, more serious; I
    want more soul and more love and more heart.</p>

    <p>But you may be sure that I will not and cannot cry out
    against it, that I will not <i>rebel</i> against it. But it
    makes me sad, it takes away my pleasure, it upsets me, and
    personally I am absolutely at a loss about what to do. What
    sometimes makes me sad is this: formerly, when I started, I
    used to think, If only I make so or so much progress, I shall
    get a job somewhere, and I shall be on a straight road and find
    my way through life.</p>

    <p>But now something else occurs, and I fear, or rather expect,
    instead of a job, a kind of jail - I expect such things as,
    Yes, some things in your work are rather good (I doubt if they
    really mean it), but, you see, we have no use for work like
    yours, we need current events (for example, the Graphic - we
    print on <i>Saturday</i> what happened on <i>Thursday</i>).</p>

    <p>Look here, Theo boy, I cannot make `Types of Beauty'; I do
    try my best to make `Heads of the People.' You know, I would
    like to do the kind of work those who started the Graphic did,
    though I do not count myself their equal; I would take a fellow
    or woman or child from the street, and draw them in my studio.
    But no, they would ask me, &ldquo;Can you make chromos by
    electric light?&rdquo; In short, instead of meeting with an
    opinion, a sentiment, an aim like Dickens's (for such the
    Graphic originally stood for), one is confronted with a
    philosophy like Obach's. It makes me sad, and then I feel
    helpless. One can only undertake a thing if one has sympathy
    and co-operation.</p>

    <p>Now this brings me to another matter. Do not take offense
    when I write you my thoughts, and continue to do so. If you
    have no time to write and cannot answer at once, at all events
    when we meet again, you will know what I have in mind, and
    perhaps we shall find a practical way.</p>

    <p>This number of the Graphic is a fact which speaks clearly
    for itself, and that's why I am sending it to you.</p>

    <p>With a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
