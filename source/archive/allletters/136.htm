  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Your letter has done me good and I thank you for having
    written to me in the way you have.</p>

    <p>The roll with a new selection of etchings and various prints
    has just arrived. First and foremost the masterly etching,
    &ldquo;Le Buisson&rdquo; by Daubigny and Ruysdael. Well! I
    propose to make two drawings, in sepia or something else, one
    after that etching, the other after &ldquo;Le Four dans les
    Landes&rdquo; by Th. Rousseau. Indeed, I have already done a
    sepia of the latter, but if you compare it with Daubigny's
    etching you will see that it contrasts feebly, although
    considered on its own the sepia may betray some tone and
    sentiment. I shall have to return to it and tackle it
    again.</p>

    <p>I am still working on Bargue's <i>Cours de Dessin,</i> and
    intend to finish it before I go on to anything else, for both
    my hand and my mind are growing daily more supple and strong as
    a result, and I cannot thank Mr. Tersteeg enough for having
    been so kind as to lend it to me. The models are outstanding.
    Meanwhile I am reading one book on anatomy and another on
    perspective, which Mr. Tersteeg also sent me. These studies are
    demanding and sometimes the books are extremely tedious, but I
    think all the same that it's doing me good to study them.</p>

    <p>So you see that I am working away hard, though for the
    moment it is not yielding particularly gratifying results. But
    I have every hope that these thorns will bear white blossoms in
    due course and that these apparently fruitless struggles are
    nothing but labour pains. First the pain, then the joy.</p>

    <p>You mention Lessore. I think I remember some very elegant
    watercolour landscapes by him in a blonde tone, worked with an
    apparent ease and a light touch, yet with accuracy and
    distinction, and a somewhat decorative effect (that is not
    meant badly, but on the contrary, in a favourable sense). So I
    know a little about his work and you mention someone not
    entirely unknown to me.</p>

    <p>I admire the portrait of Victor Hugo. It is done very
    conscientiously with the evident intention of portraying the
    truth without straining after effect. That is precisely what
    makes it so effective.</p>

    <p>Last winter I pored over some of Hugo's works, Le Dernier
    Jour d'un Condamn&eacute; and an excellent book on Shakespeare.
    I first started studying this writer long ago. He is just as
    splendid as Rembrandt. Shakespeare is to Charles Dickens or
    Victor Hugo what Ruysdael is to Daubigny, and Rembrandt to
    Millet.</p>

    <p>What you say in your letter about Barbizon is perfectly true
    and I can tell you one or two things that will make it clear
    how much I share your view. I haven't been to Barbizon, but
    though I haven't been there, I did go to Courri&egrave;res last
    winter. I went on a walking tour in the Pas-de-Calais, not the
    English Channel but the department, or province. I had gone on
    this trip in the hope of perhaps finding some sort of work
    there, if possible - I would have accepted anything - but in
    fact I set out a bit reluctantly, though I can't exactly say
    why. But I had told myself, You must see Courri&egrave;res. I
    had just 10 francs in my pocket and because I had started out
    by taking the train, that was soon gone, and I was on the road
    for a week, it was a rather gruelling trip. Anyway, I saw
    Courri&egrave;res and the outside of M. Jules Breton's studio.
    The outside of the studio was a bit of a disappointment, seeing
    that it is in a brand-new studio, recently built of brick, of a
    Methodist regularity, with an inhospitable, stone-cold and
    forbidding aspect, just like C. M.'s Jovinda, which, between
    ourselves, I am none too keen on either, for the same reason.
    If I could have seen the inside, I am quite certain that I
    should have given no further thought to the outside, but there
    you are, <label content="fear.shyness">I could not see the inside because I dared not
    introduce myself and go in.</label> Elsewhere in Courri&egrave;res I
    looked for traces of Jules Breton or any other artist. All I
    was able to find was a portrait of him at a photographer's and
    a copy of Titian's Entombment in a corner of the old church
    which looked very beautiful to me in the darkness and masterly
    in tone. Was it by him? I don't know because I was unable to
    make out any signature.</p>

    <p>But of any living artist, no trace, just a cafe called Cafe
    des Beaux Arts, also of new, inhospitable, stone-cold,
    repulsive brick - the caf&eacute; was decorated with a kind of
    fresco or mural depicting episodes from the life of that
    illustrious knight, Don Quixote.</p>

    <p>To tell the truth, those frescoes seemed to me rather poor
    consolation, and fairly mediocre at the time. I don't know who
    did them.</p>

    <p>But anyway I did seen the country around Courri&egrave;res
    then, the haystacks, the brown farmland or the marled earth,
    almost coffee-coloured (with whitish spots where the marl shows
    through), which seems somewhat unusual to people like us who
    are used to a blackish soil. And the French sky looked to me
    much finer and brighter than the smoky, foggy sky of the
    Borinage. What's more, there were farms and barns that, God be
    praised, still retained their mossy thatched roofs. I also saw
    the flocks of crows made famous by the pictures of Daubigny and
    Millet. Not to mention, as I ought to have done in the first
    place, the characteristic and picturesque figures of all manner
    of workmen, diggers, woodcutters, a farmhand driving his wagon
    and a silhouette of a woman in a white cap. Even in
    Courri&egrave;res there was still a coal mine or pit, I saw the
    day shift come up at nightfall: but there were no women workers
    in men's clothes as in the Borinage, just the miners looking
    tired and careworn, black with coal dust, dressed in ragged
    miners' clothes, one of them in an old army cape.</p>

    <p><label subject="psychology.depression">Although this trip nearly killed me and I came back spent
    with fatigue, with crippled feet and in more or less depressed
    state of mind, </label>I do not regret it, because I saw some
    interesting things and the terrible ordeals of suffering are
    what teach you to look at things through different eyes.</p>

    <p>I earned a few crusts here and there en route in exchange
    for a picture or a drawing or two I had in my bag. But when my
    ten francs ran out I tried to bivouac in the open air the last
    3 nights, once in an abandoned carriage which was completely
    white with hoarfrost the next morning, not the best
    accommodation, once in a pile of faggots; and once, and that
    was a slight improvement, in a haystack, that had been opened
    up, where I succeeded in making myself a slightly more
    comfortable little hideaway, though the drizzle did not exactly
    add to my enjoyment.</p>

    <p>Well, and yet it was in these depths of misery that I felt
    my energy revive and I said to myself, I shall get over it
    somehow, I shall set to work again with my pencil, which I had
    cast aside in my deep dejection, and I shall draw again, and
    from that moment I have had the feeling that everything has
    changed for me, and now I am in my stride and my pencil has
    become slightly more willing and seems to be getting more so by
    the day. My over-long and over-intense misery had discouraged
    me so much that I was unable to do anything.</p>

    <p>I saw something else during the trip - the weaver's
    villages.</p>

    <p>The miners and the weavers still form a race somehow apart
    from other workers and artisans and I have much fellow-feeling
    for them and I should consider myself fortunate if I could draw
    them one day, for then these as yet unknown, or virtually
    unknown, types would be brought out into the light of day.</p>

    <p>The man from the depths, from the abyss, <i>de
    profundis</i>, that is the miner. The other, with the
    faraway look, almost daydreaming, almost a sleepwalker, that is
    the weaver. I have been living among them now for nearly 2
    years and have learned a little of their special character, in
    particular that of the miners. And increasingly I find
    something touching and even pathetic in these poor, humble
    workers, the lowest of the low in a manner of speaking, and the
    most despised, who, owing to a possibly widely held but quite
    baseless and inaccurate presumption, are usually considered a
    race of knaves and scoundrels. Knaves, drunkards and scoundrels
    may be found here, of course, just as elsewhere, but the real
    type is nothing at all like that.</p>

    <p>You refer vaguely in your letter to my coming sooner or
    later to Paris or its environs, if it were possible and if I
    wanted to. It is of course my eager and fervent wish to go
    either to Paris or to Barbizon, or somewhere else, but how can
    I, when I do not earn a cent and when, though I work hard, it
    will be some time before I reach the point at which I can give
    any thought to something like going to Paris. For honestly, to
    be able to work properly I need at least a hundred francs a
    month. You can certainly live on less, but then you really are
    hard up, much too hard up in fact!</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Poverty stops the best minds in their tracks&rdquo;
    the old Palissy saying goes, which has some truth in it and is
    entirely true if you understand its real meaning and import.
    For the moment I do not see how it could be feasible, and the
    best thing is for me to stay here and work as hard as I can,
    and, after all, it is cheaper to live here.</p>

    <p>At the same time I must tell you that I cannot remain very
    much longer in the little room where I live now. It is very
    small room indeed, and then there are the two beds as well, the
    children's and my own. And now that I am working on Bargue's
    fairly large sheets I cannot tell you how difficult it is. I
    don't want to upset these people's domestic arrangements. They
    have already told me that I couldn't have the other room in the
    house under any circumstances, not even if I paid more, for the
    woman needs it for her washing, which in a miner's house has to
    be done almost every day. In short, I should like to rent a
    small workman's cottage. It costs about 9 francs a month.</p>

    <p>I cannot tell you (though fresh problems arise and will
    continue to arise every day), I cannot tell you how happy I am
    that I have taken up drawing again. I had been thinking about
    it for a long time, but always considered it impossible and
    beyond my abilities. But now, though I continue to be conscious
    of my failings and of my depressing dependance on a great many
    things, now I have recovered my peace of mind and my energy
    increases by the day.</p>

    <p>As far as coming to Paris is concerned, it would be of
    particular advantage to me if we could manage to establish
    contact with some good and able artist, but to be quite blunt
    about it, it might only be a repetition on a large scale of my
    trip to Courri&egrave;res, where I hoped to come across a
    living example of the species Artist and found none. For me the
    object is to learn to draw well, to gain control of my pencil,
    my charcoal or my brush. Once I have achieved that I shall be
    able to do good work almost anywhere and the Borinage is as
    picturesque as old Venice, as Arabia, as Brittany, Normandy,
    Picardy or Brie.</p>

    <p>Should my work be no good, it will be my own fault. But in
    Barbizon, you most certainly have a better chance than
    elsewhere of meeting a good artist who would be as an angel
    sent by God, should such a happy meeting take place. I say this
    in all seriousness and without exaggeration. So if, sometime or
    other, you should see the means and the opportunity, please
    think of me. Meanwhile I'll stay here quietly in some small
    workman's cottage and work as hard as I can.</p>

    <p>You mentioned M&eacute;ryon again. What you say about him is
    quite true. I know his etchings slightly. If you want to see
    something curious, then place one of his meticulous and
    powerful sketches next to a print by Viollet-le-Duc or anyone
    else engaged in architecture. If you do, then you will see
    M&eacute;ryon in his true light, thanks to the other etching
    which will serve, whether you like it or not, as a foil or
    contrast. Right, so what do you see? This. Even when he draws
    bricks, granite, iron bars, or the railing of a bridge,
    M&eacute;ryon puts into his etchings something of the human
    soul, moved by I do not know what inner sorrow. I have seen
    Victor Hugo's drawings of Gothic buildings. Well, though they
    lacked M&eacute;ryon's powerful and masterly technique, they
    had some-thing of the same sentiment. What sort of sentiment is
    that? It is akin to what Albrecht D&uuml;rer expressed in his
    &ldquo;Melancholia,&rdquo; and James Tissot and M. Maris
    (different though these two may be) in our own day. A
    discerning critic once rightly said of James Tissot, &ldquo;He
    is a troubled soul.&rdquo; However this may be, there is
    something of the human soul in his work and that is why he is
    great, immense, infinite. But place Viollet-le-Duc alongside
    and he is stone, while the other, that is, M&eacute;ryon is
    Spirit.</p>

    <p>M&eacute;ryon is said to have had so much love that, just
    like Dickens's Sydney Carton, he loved even the stones of
    certain places. But in Millet, in Jules Breton, in Jozef
    Isra&euml;ls, the precious pearl, the human soul, is even more
    in evidence and better expressed in a noble, worthier, and if
    you will allow me, more evangelical tone.</p>

    <p>But to return to M&eacute;ryon, in my view he also has a
    distant kinship with Jongkind and perhaps with Seymour Haden,
    since at times these two artists have been extremely good.</p>

    <p>Just wait, and perhaps you'll see that I too am a workman.
    Though I cannot predict what I shall be able to do, I hope to
    make a few sketches with perhaps something human in them, but
    first I must do the Bargue drawings and other more or less
    difficult things. Narrow is the way and straight the gate and
    there are only a few who find it.</p>

    <p>Thanking you for your kindness, especially for &ldquo;Le
    Buisson,&rdquo; I shake your hand,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I have now taken your whole collection, but you will get it
    back later and in addition I've got some very fine things for
    your collection of wood engravings, which I hope you will
    continue, in the two volumes of the Musee Universel<i>,</i>
    which I am keeping for you.</p>
