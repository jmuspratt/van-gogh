  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I just prepared a little note for you to go with <art id=0082>the picture
    in the box</art>; I'll send it carriage-paid (to Antwerp, or all the
    way through if possible) to your address Rue de Laval.</p>

    <p>If you have to pay anything more on it, it might be because
    they only prepay to Antwerp. But I didn't want you to have
    charges on it, as it will perhaps disappoint you.</p>

    <p>If this should be the case, take your time looking at
    it.</p>

    <p>Of course, I can't tell what Portier will say.</p>

    <p>In the way of criticism, I myself could point out things
    which will probably escape most of the critics.</p>

    <p>But the reason why I am sending it with a certain confidence
    is that, in contrast to many other pictures, there is rusticity
    and a certain life in it. And so, though painted in a different
    style, in another century than the old Dutch masters, Ostade
    for instance, it too comes from the heart of the peasant's
    life, and is original.</p>

    <p>Though I see, for instance, in the Salon number so many
    pictures which, if you like, are faultlessly drawn and painted
    as to technique, yet many of them bore me terribly because they
    give me neither food for the heart nor for the mind, because
    they have obviously been made without a certain passion. And
    there is some passion in what I am sending you.</p>

    <p>I took great delight in making it, and I have worked at it
    with a certain enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>It hasn't bored me; perhaps for that reason it will not bore
    others. Because I believe this, I send it to you.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Be sure, however, that I greatly admire things in the Salon
    number like &ldquo;The Lark&rdquo; by Jules Breton, Roll's
    picture, also the Fantin Latour, also &ldquo;The Coast of
    Cornwall,&rdquo; Vernier and some others. I think they are
    <i>splendid</i>, though I can honestly say of many other
    enormous canvases that they bore me terribly.</p>

    <p>That little woman with the spade by Lhermitte, how
    characteristic it is, how full of life, as if made <i>by a
    peasant who could paint</i>; it is a masterpiece.</p>

    <p>If I were you, I should buy copies of the Lhermittes and
    keep them for ten years. For they are masterpieces one gets in
    this way for one's 50 centimes. How is it possible that the
    magazines are not better?</p>

    <p>I heard Lan&ccedil;on is dead. I have followed his work for
    years and nothing of his has ever bored me.</p>

    <p>There is life in every little pencil stroke.</label></p>

    <p>If such a one dies - of that same race as the
    R&eacute;gameys and Renouards, it is a loss and leaves an empty
    place.</p>

    <p>Lan&ccedil;on's drawings were admirable, so manly and so
    broad.</p>

    <p>I hear Tissot had an exhibition, did you see it?</p>

    <p>It all depends on how much life and passion an artist is
    able to express in his figure; if there is real life in it,
    then a lady's figure by Alfred Stevens for instance or some
    Tissots are certainly beautiful too.</p>

    <p>And the peasants by Lhermitte, Millet, are so splendid just
    because of the life there is in them.</p>

    <p>In whatever direction one may work, be it Isra&euml;ls,
    Herkomer, so many different styles - if there is life and
    feeling in it, then it is good.</p>

    <p>I suppose there are still many beautiful pictures among
    those that have <i>not</i> been reproduced. But when I remember
    a Salon of '70 or '74, for instance, I think there used to be a
    higher standard, and since then it has been lowered. One has
    only to look over the Boetzel Albums, for instance. And the
    best masters are not even reproduced there, for instance Millet
    isn't.</p>

    <p>I don't pretend to know it all myself. On the contrary, you
    see so many Daubignys, Corots, Millets, Dupr&eacute;s,
    Isra&euml;lses, Herkomers, Bretons, etc., and I never see any
    of them. But I think about it every day and feel that the
    colour scale of all those painters is lower than it
    <i>seems</i>, and that even those pictures which seem light, if
    one looks carefully and compares, are in lower colour scale
    than even Mauve's greys. Except perhaps the <i>very best</i>
    Mauves - for instance that old one in the Post Collection with
    that caravan of old nags and his picture at the Salon two years
    ago, the launching of that smack.</p>

    <p>I hear or see so little, hardly anything at all, so I
    haven't the opportunity to test my opinions against the
    pictures themselves. But working and seeking and living with
    nature, as I told you before, that question gives me no rest.
    And there is nothing that expresses what I mean so well, there
    is nothing that gives me such a solid base for my theory as
    that saying which expresses Millet's colour and technique so
    perfectly: &ldquo;Son paysan semble peint avec la terre meme
    qu'il ensemence.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mauve - when he paints brightly - and the other <i>light</i>
    Dutch painters of good quality do not use different colours
    than the contemporary French painters or those of the old-Dutch
    school - namely very simple palettes - but here in Holland they
    use more white than Millet or Dupr&eacute; or Daubigny or
    Corot.</p>

    <p>If some pictures you might see should make you want to write
    about them sometime, I should be very glad.</p>

    <p>I just read an article in the Graphic on an exhibition of 25
    drawings by Fred. Walker. Walker died some ten years ago, you
    know. Pinwell too - while I'm on this subject, I'm thinking of
    their work too, and how clever they were. How they did in
    England exactly what Maris, Isra&euml;ls, Mauve, have done in
    Holland, namely restored nature over convention; sentiment and
    impression over academic platitudes and dullness. How they were
    the first tonists.</p>

    <p>But I remember peasants in the field by Pinwell, &ldquo;The
    Harbour of Refuge&rdquo; by Walker, of which one might also
    say, <i>peints avec la terre</i>. I ought to see more pictures
    in order to be able to draw conclusions, and I ask you only, Do
    you know anything about it? <i>Wine</i>, of course, contains a
    quantity of moisture or water, and there will always be water
    in it; but when too much water is added - it becomes weak. I do
    not pretend to say that one can, or must, paint light tones
    without white, no more than I should ever assert that wine must
    be dry. But I do say that one must take care in our days of
    clarity (?) and lightness (?), not to water wine too much, not
    to mix too much white in the wine of colour, so that some
    passion remains and the effects do not become too tame and
    weaken the whole thing.</p>

    <p>Do you know where one could learn something about this?</p>

    <p>From a picture by Leys, not from the first period, but from
    Ley's second and third period.</p>

    <p>I remember &ldquo;The Skaters&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Walk on
    the Ramparts.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In both pictures there are figures in the snow, and neither
    picture is grey; they are as light as the current Dutch
    painters would paint snow. That little picture by Millet which
    you mentioned once as the archetype of an impressionist
    picture, is it in the Luxembourg?</p>

    <p>I believe that many a Dutch landscape would become white,
    and yet coloured compared to that tone. One thing I am sure of,
    namely that it is mostly painted with red, blue, and yellow,
    with perhaps a little, but probably not much, white.</p>

    <p>I haven't seen it for ten or twelve years, but the more I
    think of it, while myself seeking certain effects in nature,
    the less I am inclined to believe that the best French painters
    use as much white as one seems to use nowadays.</p>

    <p>I know something depends on the models too. When I think of
    the Scheveningen girl who sits regularly for Artz, and whom I
    remember quite well, she is as fair and as clean as some
    whores. That also is beautiful to paint, yes.</p>

    <p>But peasants or fishermen in small villages and far from the
    city - they are different no matter where they are. <i>They
    remind one of the earth</i>, sometimes they seem modelled in
    it.</p>

    <p>In the poems by Jules Breton, I remember the lines and I
    believe it is in the very poem he dedicated to Millet
    <sup>1</sup> (a peasant going home through the potato fields in
    the evening):</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Par le cr&eacute;puscle et le h&acirc;le<br>

    Le paysan deux fois bruni.<br>

    <p></p>

    [By the twilight and his suntan<br>

    The peasant is twice browned.]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>But don't suppose that I don't like bright pictures for that
    reason - to be sure I do; I know a Bastien Lepage - a bride
    painted quite <i>blanc sur blanc</i> with a little brown face
    in the middle of the picture, splendid, and so many Dutch
    pictures with snow, mist and sky - splendid.</p>

    <p>I only want to point out that one may do as one likes, for
    instance Jaap Maris, who is sometimes very light - next day
    will paint a view of the city by night in the darkest colour
    scale. What I want to say especially is that pictures like some
    old Cabats, for instance, certain Dupr&eacute;s, though perhaps
    only painted with red, blue and yellow, without much white, are
    <i>in my opinion</i> not at all inferior to later greyer
    conceptions.</p>

    <p>I got this far yesterday. I just received your letter with
    the enclosure, for which hearty thanks.</p>

    <p>What you write about the Salon is very interesting.</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">From what you say about the picture by Besnard, I see that
    you understood what I wrote about broken colours, orange broken
    by blue and the reverse.</p>

    <p>However, there are many other colour scales too, but that of
    orange against blue is logical; so is yellow against violet, so
    is red against green.</label></p>

    <p>The box for the picture is ready, so I am sending it flat.
    It is a light box, but it must dry another day or two. I'm
    sending ten other painted studies at the same time.</p>

    <p>Please tell me some more about the picture by Uhde; you know
    Rembrandt painted the same subject in his large picture at the
    National Gallery.</p>

    <p>I am in all the mess of moving. Once more, thanks for what
    you sent. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
