    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>In your last letter you wrote that there is a good chance of
    your coming to Holland pretty soon. I am very glad because I am
    looking forward to seeing you. Now I know that you are coming,
    I think it even more unnecessary to send you a few things;
    perhaps I might have if you were not coming, so that you might
    see my drawings do not get any worse, though they are far from
    what they ought to be. Well, you will see for yourself what is
    in them when you come.</p>

    <p>In my last letter I wrote about the Salon's catalogue; I did
    so to remind you of it, in case you might be able to get one.
    Of course, if need be I can do very well without it - it is not
    a necessity of life.</p>

    <p>But there is another thing which is a necessity, and when
    you come, and if it is not too difficult for you to carry,
    bring some with you then.<label content="art.support"> I mean, <i>white Ingres paper</i>. I
    bought some of it from Brussels and worked on it with pleasure,
    and it is very well suited to pen drawing, especially for a
    reed pen. Now I have been without it for quite a time, and here
    I can only get smooth paper without any grain (unless I take
    Whatman or Harding, but that is too expensive for sketches -
    the Ingres paper costs 10 centimes a sheet, I think). Well, try
    your best to put as large a package of it as you can in your
    bag, and you will give me more pleasure than with anything
    else.</label></p>

    <p>I have made another drawing in <art id=903>the Liesbosch</art>,
    and now it has become quite hot - too hot to sit on the
    heath by day - so I work at home now, and am copying the
    <art id=833>drawings by Holbein from the Bargues</art>.
    Remembering what you told me once, I have tried to draw <art id=876>a few portraits after
    photographs</art>, <art id=849>and </art>I think this is good practice.</p>

    <p>As I asked you before, write whenever you can and receive a
    handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
