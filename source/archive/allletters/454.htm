  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Of course all my attention is concentrated on gaining what I
    want to gain, namely - freedom of scope for my career. That
    means overcoming the obstacles instead of being buried under
    them. I have already told you that my health is very poor and
    that I shall have to act energetically to rebuild it.</p>

    <p>Further, I have told you that there is no reason for me to
    go and work again in the country for the first year, that it is
    infinitely better for my whole future to draw from the plaster
    casts and from the nude in the city. Must one be on one's guard
    against a general fall in prices, diverse slumps, and
    consequently the rigidity of business routine these last years,
    or mustn't one? However, I don't ask you to have a fixed
    opinion about it. I don't have one either.</p>

    <p>One cannot predict anything with certainty in such a large
    field. So let's leave it at that. But if one analyzes from up
    close, one sees that the greatest and most energetic people of
    the century have always worked <i>against the grain</i>, and
    they have always worked out of personal initiative. Both in
    painting and in literature. (I do not know anything about
    music, but I suppose it has been the same there.) To begin on a
    small scale, to persevere quand m&ecirc;me, to produce much
    with small capital, to have character instead of money, more
    audacity than credit, like Millet and Sensier, Balzac, Zola, de
    Goncourt, Delacroix. But to start a studio in Paris at once
    might not be so good as doing it after <i>a year of study</i>,
    both for you and for me.</p>

    <p>Let me draw for a year at Cormon's while you thoroughly
    investigate business conditions once more, and the various
    opportunities. And then I think we may risk it.</p>

    <p>Because in a time of financial crisis like the present,
    money is what ammunition is to a soldier in a hostile country -
    don't let's waste our powder.</p>

    <p>Further - I have heard several fellows, both painters and
    ordinary people, complain, &ldquo;I have taken an expensive
    room to induce people to come to me, but since then nobody has
    come, and I myself do not feel at home in it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Still, I believe that for portraits it is necessary to have
    a certain comfort in the studio, otherwise people who come to
    pose there would get disgusted.</p>

    <p>But if one wants to start a studio, one must consider well
    where to rent it, where one has the greatest chance of getting
    visitors, and making friends, and getting known.</p>

    <p>Because of the primary necessity of drawing for a year,
    <i>for the moment</i> the question of a good studio is quite
    secondary, and anything will do.</p>

    <p>If we do it quietly and intelligently, I don't think that
    this year of drawing would be a misfortune. On the contrary, we
    shall have time to consider everything at our ease, and to look
    before we leap.</p>

    <p>If I came to Paris, the most practical thing to do would be
    to wait for a year before taking a studio. In that year we
    would get to know each other better and more intimately, which
    may bring a great change, and then we should be less afraid to
    undertake bigger things, because meanwhile we should have
    fortified the weak points.</p>

    <p>If we work for another year, if we recover our health, both
    you and I - <i>then</i> we can resist things so much better
    than <i>now</i>.</p>

    <p>But what must I do now? Look here, going back to Brabant is
    really a useless detour, and I shall lose money and time by it.
    Why can't I go straight to Paris from here, if you like, and go
    on working here till I leave? <label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">I tell you, I am in such a
    wretched condition that, if there is any money to spare, let me
    look after my health then, and let the rest go, for at home
    they can manage just as well with a hired man, even better
    perhaps.</p>

    <p>If I do not take some nourishing food I am sure to get sick.
    It would not be my fault, and indeed I should not care much,
    let come what may.</label></p>

    <p>If I go to Brabant, I have the expenses of my journey, I
    must also pay for my room there, which I have given up, and
    must find another place to store my things, which would be no
    less than 50 francs rent, and another 50 francs in advance for
    a new storage place and for moving. I should also be obliged to
    pay an outstanding colour bill, and of course I should begin to
    paint there again.</p>

    <p>Now I thought that through force majeure, I am free to
    declare myself unable to fulfill those obligations for the
    moment, i.e. not to pay my rent there, but say, &ldquo;Put my
    furniture in your attic, keep it as a security, I shall pay you
    when I come to get it&rdquo;; then I need not rent a new place
    for storage.</p>

    <p>If I am so weak as to spend money all the time, even
    <i>though I cannot afford it</i>, I do myself <i>too much</i>
    harm, and make myself unfit for my work.</p>

    <p>I think you will agree with me. If you remember how I have
    complained lately that I could not go on in that way, you see
    that there was reason for it.</p>

    <p>If I had known beforehand what I have noticed here about
    opportunities to work in a studio, I should have done it
    sooner.</p>

    <p>Now - as I <i>must</i> go on, and as I am ill at the same
    time, I cannot but ask you to allow me to stay here till I go
    to Paris, and by all means let me go to Paris no later than
    when the course here ends - that is March 31.</p>

    <p>Then we shall still have the unavoidable expenses of the
    journey to Paris. You will have to move too, which also brings
    expenses. So Brabant is a useless detour, a loss of time,
    etc.</p>

    <p>The way things are now, I must live from hand to mouth, and
    what is unpaid must wait.</p>

    <p>When I have recovered my health and begin to sell in Paris -
    all right, then I can pay the rent and the colours.</p>

    <p>I <i>can't</i> now, I don't have the money, neither do you,
    that's all.</p>

    <p>Besides, I have had so much unpleasantness there that I need
    not consider any of their feelings.</p>

    <p>It would also be a weakness on your part if you tried to
    change it.</p>

    <p>You continually write me that you have no money; all right,
    so that's a fact. If it is not possible to <i>make</i> money
    for food, it need not be possible for rent either, or for
    superfluous travelling expenses.</p>

    <p>And I know too well that at home Rijke, the gardener, or
    Husing is much more fit than I to pack things up and send them
    off. I'd do it if I were there, but to travel there on purpose
    when there are at least six pairs of hands as good as mine at
    their disposal, No. After all I don't care, but I tell you only
    what is right, and I point out to you the urgency of carrying
    through what will help us on. It would not be pleasant for me
    to come back sick either; you can't say anything against
    that.</p>

    <p>Let me recover my health first; I am now too far below the
    mark.</p>

    <p>In short - the conclusion of this and the previous letter
    is: To go on quietly either here or, much better still, at
    Cormon's; besides, I am sick, though I keep going.</p>

    <p>If I saw a possibility of doing it, I should not object to
    going back to Brabant. I should even do it gladly if I could,
    but neither you nor I have the means, and they can spare me
    there better than they can use me.</p>

    <p>Goodbye - write me soon,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
