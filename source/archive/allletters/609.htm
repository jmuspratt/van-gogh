  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I was longing for your letter, and so I was very glad to get
    it and to see from it that you are well, also Jo and the
    friends you speak of.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">I have to ask you to send the white that I had ordered as
    soon as possible, and to add five or ten meters of canvas, at
    your discretion.</label></p>

    <p>Now I must begin with some rather irritating news, as I see
    it. It is that there have been some expenses during my stay
    here which I thought M. Peyron had notified you of as they
    occurred, which he told me the other day he had not done, so
    that it has mounted up to about 125 francs, deducting from it
    the 10 that you sent by money order. It is for paints, canvas,
    frames and stretchers, my journey to Arles the other day, a
    linen suit and various repairs.</p>

    <p>I use two colours here, white lead and ordinary blue, but in
    rather large quantities, and the canvas is for when I want to
    work on unprepared and stronger canvas.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, this comes just at the time when I would
    gladly have repeated my journey to Arles, etc.</p>

    <p>That said, I tell you that we are having some superb autumn
    days and that I am taking advantage of them. I have some
    studies, among others <art id=0637>a mulberry tree all yellow on stony
    ground, outlined against the blue of the sky</art>, in
    which study I hope you will see that I am on Monticelli's
    track.</p>

    <p>You will have received the package of canvases that I sent
    you last Saturday. It surprises me very much that M.
    Isa&auml;cson wants to write an article on my
    studies. I should be glad to persuade him to wait, his article
    will lose absolutely nothing by it, and with yet another year
    of work, I could - I hope - put before him some more
    characteristic things, with more decisive drawing, and more
    expert knowledge with regard to the Proven&ccedil;al
    south.</p>

    <p>It was very kind of M. Peyron to speak of my affairs in
    those terms - I have not dared to ask leave to go to Arles
    lately, which I very much want to do, thinking that he would
    disapprove. Not, however, that I suspected that he believed in
    any connection between my previous journey and the attack which
    closely followed it. The thing is that there are some people
    there whom I felt, and again feel, the need for seeing.</p>

    <p>Though not having, like the good Pr&eacute;vot, a
    mistress in the Midi who holds me captive, I can't help getting
    attached to people and things.</p>

    <p>And now that I am staying on here provisionally and, as far
    as I can see, shall stay the winter - till spring - shan't I
    stay here too till the summer? That will depend mostly on my
    health.</p>

    <p>What you say of Auvers <sup>1</sup> is nevertheless a very
    pleasant prospect, and either sooner or later - without looking
    further - we must fix on that. If I come north, even supposing
    that there were no room at this doctor's house, it is probable
    that after your recommendation and old Pissarro's he would find
    me board either with a family or quite simply at an inn. The
    main thing is to know the doctor, so that in case of an attack
    I do not fall into the hands of the police and get carried off
    to an asylum by force.</p>

    <p>And I assure you that the North will interest me like a new
    country.</p>

    <p>But anyway, for the moment there is absolutely no hurry.</p>

    <p>I reproach myself for being so behindhand in my
    correspondence. I would like to write to
    Isa&auml;cson, Gauguin and Bernard, but writing does
    not always succeed, and besides, my work presses.</p>

    <p>Yes, I should like to tell Isa&auml;cson that he
    would do well to wait, there is nothing in it yet of what, with
    continued health, I hope to attain. There isn't anything worth
    mentioning about my work now. When I am back, it will form at
    best a sort of whole, &ldquo;Impressions of Provence,&rdquo;
    but what could he say now, when I still have to get the accent
    of the olives, the fig trees, the vines, the cypresses, all the
    other characteristic things, the same as the Alps, which must
    be given more character.</p>

    <p>How I should like to see what Gauguin and Bernard have
    brought along. I have <art id=0638>a study of two yellowing poplars against
    a background of mountains</art> and <art id=0642>a view of the park
    here, an autumn effect in which the drawing is a little more
    na&iuml;ve and more - home-felt</art>.</p>

    <p>Altogether it is difficult to leave a country before you
    have done something to prove that you have felt and loved
    it.</p>

    <p>If I return to the North, I propose to make a lot of Greek
    studies, you know, studies painted with white and blue and a
    little orange only, as if in the open air.</p>

    <p>I must draw and seek style. Yesterday I saw at the Almoner's
    here a picture which impressed me, a Proven&ccedil;al
    lady with a face full of intelligence and race, in a red dress,
    a figure like those that Monticelli had in mind.</p>

    <p>It wasn't without great faults, but there was simplicity in
    it, and how sad it is to see how they have degenerated here, as
    we have from our people in Holland.</p>

    <p>I am writing you in haste so as not to delay replying to
    your kind letter, hoping that you will write again without
    waiting long. I have seen very beautiful subjects for tomorrow
    - in the mountains.</p>

    <p>Many kind regards to Jo and to the friends, especially thank
    old Pissarro, when you have a chance, for his information,
    which will certainly be useful.</p>

    <p>Shaking both your hands, believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

        <p>Pissarro had talked to Theo about Dr. Gachet in Auvers,
        a great art lover and art collector who might be willing to
        have Vincent live with him.</p>
