    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>By the same mail you will receive the two little books I
    promised you. I marked a few things in them, but you will find
    many other beautiful ones besides. But as I wrote to you
    already, one grows so fond of them, especially when one is in
    the country itself. It is again Saturday evening, and the
    weather is lovely; the sea is calm, it is low tide, the sky is
    a subtle milky blue, on the horizon a hint of fog. All morning
    the weather was so nice, it was so clear there where I can now
    see the fog.</p>

    <p>The town has something very peculiar about it; everywhere
    you can see the influence of the sea - but you know that
    characteristic, too, for one also finds it at The Hague and
    Scheveningen.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">Do you go to see Uncle Cor now and then? Sometimes I have
    such a longing to see him, I wrote to him yesterday. Tell Mr.
    Tersteeg something about the school here. Honestly, I have had
    some happy hours here, <i>yet I don't have plain and complete
    confidence in this happiness, in this peace.</i></label> The one
    may be the result of the other. Man rarely declares that he is
    satisfied; as soon as he finds that that it goes too well, the
    sooner he thinks that it will not go well enough. But this is
    in parenthesis; we must not talk about it, but continue quietly
    on our way.</p>

    <p>Spend a pleasant Sunday morning. Give my love to all the
    Roos family, also to Mr. and Mrs. Tersteeg and Betsy and a firm
    handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
  </body>
