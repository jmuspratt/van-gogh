  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter and the 100-franc note it contained. I
    have sent you sketches of the paintings destined for
    Holland. Of course the painted studies are more brilliant in
    colour. I'm once again hard at it, still orchards in
    blossom.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">The air here certainly does me good. I wish you could fill
    your lungs with it; one effect it has on me is comical enough -
    one small glass of cognac makes me tipsy here, so that as I
    don't have to fall back on stimulants to make my blood
    circulate, there will be less strain on my constitution.</label> The
    only thing is that <label subject="health.gastrointestinal.stomach">my stomach has been terribly weak since I
    came here,</label> but after all that's probably only a matter of time.
    I hope to make great progress this year, and indeed I need
    to.</p>

    <p>I have another orchard, as good as <art id=0394>the pink peach trees</art>,
    apricot trees of a very pale pink. At the moment I am working
    on some <art id=0403>plum trees, yellowish-white, with thousands of black
    branches</art>. I am using a tremendous lot of
    colours and canvases, but all the same I hope it isn't a waste
    of money.</p>

    <p>Out of 4 canvases, perhaps one at the most will
    make a <i>painting</i>, like the <art id=0397>one for Tersteeg</art> or Mauve; but
    the studies, I hope, will come in useful for exchanges.</p>

    <p>When can I send you anything? I have a great mind to do a
    second version like Tersteeg's, because it is better than the
    Asni&egrave;res studies.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I saw another bull fight, where 5 men worked
    the bull with darts and cockades. One toreador crushed a
    ball in jumping the barricade. He was a blonde man with grey
    eyes and lots of sang-froid; people said he'll be ill long
    enough. He was dressed in sky blue and gold, just like the
    little horseman in our Monticelli, the 3 figures in a wood.
    The arenas are a fine sight when there's sunshine and a
    crowd.</p>

    <p>Bravo for Pissarro, I think he is right. I hope he will make
    an exchange with us one day.</p>

    <p>And the same for Seurat. It would be a good thing to have a
    painted study of his.</p>

    <p>Well, I'm working hard, hoping that we can do something with
    things of this kind.</p>

    <p>This month will be a hard time for both you and me, but if
    you can manage it, it will be to our advantage to make the most
    we can of the orchards in bloom. I am well started now, and I
    think I must have ten more, the same subject. You know I am
    changeable in my work, and this craze for painting orchards
    will not last for ever. After this it may be the arenas. Then I
    must do a <i>tremendous</i> lot of drawing, because I want to
    make some drawings in the manner of Japanese prints. There is
    nothing like striking while the iron is hot.</p>

    <p><label content="health.fatigue">I shall be all in when the orchards are over, for they are
    size 25 and 30 and 20 canvases.</label> We should not have too many of
    them, even if I could knock off twice as many. It seems to me
    that this may really break the ice in Holland. Mauve's death
    was a terrible blow to me. You will see that the pink peach
    trees were painted with a certain passion.</p>

    <p>I must also have a starry night with cypresses, or perhaps
    above all, a field of ripe corn; there are some wonderful
    nights here. I am in a continual fever of work.</p>

    <p>I'm very curious to know what the result will be at the end
    of a year. <label content="health.general">I hope that by that time I shall be less bothered
    with breakdowns. At present I feel pretty bad some days, but I
    don't worry about it in the least, as it is nothing but the
    reaction after last winter, which was out of the ordinary. And
    my blood is coming right, that is the great thing.</label></p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">I must reach the point where my pictures will cover my
    expenses, and even more than that, taking into account how much
    was spent in the past. Well, it will come. I don't make a
    success of everything, I admit, but I'm getting on. So far you
    have not complained of my expenses here, but I warn you that if
    I continue to work at the same rate, I shall have great
    difficulty in making both ends meet. But the work is heavy
    indeed.</label></p>

    <p>If there should happen to be a month or a fortnight when you
    were hard pressed, let me know and I will set to work on some
    drawings, which will cost us less. I mean, you must not put
    yourself out unnecessarily, there is so much to do here, all
    sorts of studies, not the way it is in Paris, where you can't
    sit down wherever you want.</p>

    <p>If you can finance a rather heavy month, so much the better,
    since orchards in bloom are the kind of thing one has some
    chance of selling or exchanging.</p>

    <p>But it occurred to me that you have to pay your rent, so you
    must tell me if things are too steep.</p>

    <p>I am still going about with the Danish painter all the time,
    but he is going home soon. He's an intelligent boy, and all
    right as far as fidelity and manners go, but his painting is
    still rather spineless. You will probably see him when he
    passes through Paris.</p>

    <p>You did well to go to see Bernard. If he goes to serve in
    Algiers, who knows but that I might go there too to keep him
    company.</p>

    <p>Is it really over at last, this winter in Paris? I think
    what Kahn said is very true, that I have not sufficiently
    considered values, but they'll be saying very different things
    in a little while - and no less true.</p>

    <p>It isn't possible to get values and colour.</p>

    <p>Th. Rousseau did it better than anyone else, and with the
    mixing of his colours, the darkening caused by time has
    increased and his pictures are now unrecognizable.</p>

    <p>You can't be at the pole and the equator at the same
    time.</p>

    <p>You must choose your own line, as I hope to do, and it will
    probably be colour. Good-bye for the present. A handshake to
    you, Koning and the comrades.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
