  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>In my last letter you will have found a little sketch of
    that perspective frame I mentioned. I just came back from the
    blacksmith, who made iron points to go on the sticks and iron
    corners for the frame.</p>

    <p>It consists of two long stakes; the frame may be attached to
    them either upright or horizontally with strong wooden
    pegs.</p>

    <p>[<art id=250_V-T_2230>Here was drawn a sketch of the perspective frame.</art>]</p>

    <p>So on the shore or in the meadow or in the fields one can
    took through it as <i>through a window</i>, the vertical lines
    and the perpendicular line of the frame and the diagonal lines
    and the point of intersection, or else the division in squares,
    certainly give a few basic markers, with the help of which one
    can make a firm drawing, from the indication of the main lines
    and proportions - at least for those who have some instinct for
    perspective and some understanding of the reason why and the
    manner in which perspective gives an apparent change of
    direction to the lines and a change of size to the lines and to
    the whole mass. Without this the instrument is of little or no
    use at all, and it makes one <i>dizzy</i> to look through it. I
    think you can imagine how it is a delightful thing to focus the
    viewer on the sea, on the green meadows, or in winter on the
    snowy field or in autumn on the fantastic network of thin and
    thick branches and trunks or on a stormy sky.</p>

    <p>With long and continuous practice it enables one to draw
    quick as lightning, - and once the drawing is established to
    paint quick as lightning also.</p>

    <p>In fact, <i>for painting</i> it is absolutely the thing, for
    to express sky-earth-sea one needs the brush, or rather in
    order to express all that in drawing it is necessary to know
    and to understand the treatment of the brush. I certainly
    believe that if I paint for some time, it will have great
    influence on my drawing. I already tried it in January, but
    then I had to stop, the reason for my decision being, aside
    from a few other things, that I was too hesitant in my drawing.
    Now six months have passed that have been quite devoted to
    drawing. Well, it is with new courage that I start to paint
    again. The perspective frame is really a fine piece of
    workmanship; l am sorry you did not see it before you left. It
    cost me quite a bit, but I have had it made so solidly that it
    will last a long time. So next Monday I begin to make large
    charcoal studies with it, and begin to <i>paint</i> small
    studies. If I succeed in these two things, then I hope that
    better-painted things will follow soon.</p>

    <p>I want my studio to be a real painter's studio by the time
    you come again. I had to stop in January, as you know, for
    several different reasons, but after all it may be considered
    like some defect in a machine, a screw or a bar that was not
    strong enough and had to be replaced by a stronger one.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">I bought a pair of strong and warm trousers, and as I had
    bought a pair of strong shoes just before you came, I am now
    prepared to weather the storm and rain.</label> It is my decided aim to
    learn from this painting of landscape a few things about
    <i>technique</i> which I feel I need for the <i>figure</i>,
    namely to express different <i>materials</i>, and the
    <i>tone</i> and the <i>colour</i>. In one word, to express the
    bulk - the body - of things. Through your coming it became
    possible to me, but before you came there was not a day when I
    did not think in this way about it, only I should have had to
    keep exclusively to black and white and to the outline a little
    longer. - But now I have <i>launched my boat</i>. Adieu, boy,
    once more, a hearty handshake and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
