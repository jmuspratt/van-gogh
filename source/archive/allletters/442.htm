  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It's more than time I thanked you for the 50 fr. you sent,
    which enabled me to get through the month, although from today
    onwards things will be more or less back to normal.</p>

    <p>But - a few more studies have been done and the more I paint
    the more progress I think I make. The moment I received the
    money I took on a beautiful model and did a life-sized painting
    of her head. It's all quite light, except for the black hair.
    Yet the head itself stands out in tone against a background
    into which I have tried to put a golden glimmer of light.
    [Painting lost]</p>

    <p>Anyway, here is the colour range: a flesh colour full of
    tonal values, with more bronze in the neck, jet-black hair -
    black which I had to do with carmine and Prussian blue -
    off-white for the little jacket, light yellow, much lighter
    than the white, for the background. A touch of flame in the
    jet-black hair and again a flame-coloured bow in the
    off-white.</p>

    <p>She's a girl from a caf&eacute;-chantant and yet the
    expression I was looking for was somewhat &ldquo;ecce
    homo-like.&rdquo; But that was because I was aiming for the
    truth, especially in the expression, though I also wanted to
    put my own thoughts into it. When the model arrived, it was
    obvious she had had quite a few busy nights - and she said
    something that was fairly characteristic: &ldquo;Pour moi le
    champagne ne m'&eacute;gaye pas, il me rend tout triste.&rdquo;
    [For me, champagne doesn't cheer me up, it makes me very sad.]
    Then I knew how matters stood and tried to produce something
    voluptuous and at the same time heart-rending.</p>

    <p><art id=0207>I've started a second study of the same subject in profile</art>.</p>

    <p>Apart from that I've done the portrait about which, as I
    told you, I'd been negotiating, and a study of the same head
    for myself. And now, during these last few days of the month,
    I'm hoping to paint another head of a man. I feel very
    cheerful, especially as far as work is concerned, and being
    here is doing me good.</p>

    <p>I imagine that no matter what the girls may be, one can make
    money painting them, sooner than anything else. There's no
    denying that they can be damned beautiful, and that it is in
    keeping with the times that just that kind of painting should
    be gaining ground. Nor can there be any objections to that from
    even the highest artistic standpoint - painting <i>human
    beings</i>, that was the old Italian art, that was Millet and
    that is Breton.</p>

    <p>The only question is whether one should start from the soul
    or from the clothes, and whether one allows the form to serve
    as a peg for hanging ribbons and bows from, or if one looks
    upon the form as a means of conveying an impression, a
    sentiment - or again, if one does modelling for the sake of
    modelling because it is such an infinitely beautiful thing to
    do. Only the first is ephemeral, the other two are high
    art.</p>

    <p>What rather pleased me was that the girl who posed for me
    wanted to have one of the portraits for herself, preferably
    just like the one I'd done. And that she's promised to let me
    paint a study of her in a dancer's costume at her room, as soon
    as possible. It can't be done right away because the man who
    runs the caf&eacute; where she stays objects to her posing, but
    she's about to take lodgings with another girl, and both she
    and the other girl would like to have their portraits done. And
    I really very much hope that I'll get her back, for she has a
    remarkable head, and she's witty.</p>

    <p>However, I must first get into practice because it certainly
    takes a special knack - they don't have much time or patience.
    Actually, the work needn't be the worse for being done fairly
    quickly, and one must be able to paint even if the model
    doesn't sit stock-still.</p>

    <p>Well, you can see that I am working with a will. If I could
    sell something so that I could earn a bit more, I should work
    even harder.</p>

    <p>As for Portier - I haven't lost heart yet - but poverty is
    dogging my steps and at present all dealers are suffering a
    little from the same defect, that of being more or less
    &ldquo;une nation retir&eacute;e du monde&rdquo; [a people
    withdrawn from society] - they are so much sunk in gloom that
    how is one really to feel inspired to go grubbing about in all
    that indifference and apathy - the more so as the disease is
    contagious.</p>

    <p>For it's just a lot of nonsense that business is slack, one
    has to work quand bien m&ecirc;me with self-confidence and
    enthusiasm, in short with some zeal.</p>

    <p>As for Portier - you wrote to me yourself that he was the
    first to show the impressions and that he was overwhelmed by
    Durand-Ruel - well, one is bound to conclude from this that he
    has the initiative not just to say things but also to <i>do</i>
    them. It could be put down to his 60 years, however - and
    anyway, perhaps it was just one of those many cases when, at
    the time when paintings were all the rage, and trade was doing
    well, a great many intelligent people were being wantonly
    brushed aside, as if they were incompetent and of no
    importance, simply because they couldn't bring themselves to
    believe that the sudden rage in paintings and the enormous rise
    in prices would last. <i>Now</i> that business is hanging fire,
    one sees those same dealers who were so very entreprenant
    [enterprising] a few years ago - let's say about 10 years ago -
    turning more or less into &ldquo;une nation retir&eacute;e du
    monde.&rdquo; And we haven't yet seen the end of it.</p>

    <p>Personal initiative with little or no capital is perhaps the
    seed corn for the future. We shall see.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Yesterday I saw a large photograph of a Rembrandt I didn't
    know - I was tremendously impressed by it - it was the head of
    a woman, the light falling on breast, throat, chin, the tip of
    the nose and the lower jaw. Forehead and eyes in the shadow of
    a large hat, with feathers that are probably red. Probably more
    red or yellow in the low-necked jacket. Dark background. The
    expression a mysterious smile like that of Rembrandt himself in
    his self-portrait with Saskia on his knee and a glass of wine
    in his hand.</label></p>

    <p>My thoughts are full of Rembrandt and Hals these days, not
    because I see many of their paintings but because I see so many
    types among the people here that remind me of that period. I
    still keep going to those bals populaires [dance halls] to look
    at the heads of the woman and of the sailors and soldiers. One
    pays an entrance fee of 20 or 30 centimes and drinks a glass of
    beer - for there isn't much hard drinking and one can have a
    firs-rate time all evening, or at least I can, just watching
    the people's en-train [high spirits].</p>

    <p>I must do a lot of work from the model, it's the only way to
    ensure real progress.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">I've discovered that my appetite has been held in check a
    bit too long and when I received your money I couldn't stomach
    any food. </label>But I shall certainly do my best to remedy that. it
    doesn't take away from the fact that I have all my wits and
    energy about me when I'm painting. But when I'm out of doors,
    work in the open air is too much for me and I come over all
    weak.</p>

    <p>Well, painting is something that wears one out. However, Van
    der Loo [the van Gogh's doctor in Brabant] said, when I
    consulted him shortly before I came here, that I am reasonably
    strong apr&egrave;s tout. That I needn't despair of reaching
    the requisite age to produce a complete body of work. I told
    him that I knew several painters who, for all their
    nervousness, etc., had reached the age of 60, or even 70,
    fortunately for themselves, and that I should like to do the
    same.</p>

    <p>I also believe that if one aims for serenity, and retains
    one's zest for living, one's state of mind helps a great deal.
    And in that respect I have gained by coming here, for I've new
    ideas and new means of expressing what I want; <label content="art.materials">the better
    brushes are going to prove a great help, and I'm very excited
    by those two colours carmine and cobalt.</p>

    <p>Cobalt - is a divine colour and there is nothing as fine for
    putting an atmosphere round things. Carmine is the red of wine
    and is warm and lively like wine. The same goes for emerald
    green too. It's false economy to dispense with them, with those
    colours. Cadmium as well.</label></p>

    <p>Something about my constitution that has pleased me a great
    deal is that a doctor in Amsterdam, with whom I once discussed
    a few things that sometimes made me think that I wasn't long
    for this world, and whose opinion I didn't ask for directly,
    wanting simply to gauge the first impression of someone who
    didn't know me at all and availing myself of a small upset I
    had at the time to bring the conversation round to my general
    constitution - I was absolutely delighted that this doctor took
    me for an ordinary worker, saying, &ldquo;I daresay you're an
    ironworker by trade.&rdquo; That's exactly what I'd been trying
    to achieve - when I was younger you could tell that my mind was
    overwrought, and now I look like a bargee or an ironworker.</p>

    <p>And changing one's constitution so that one gets &ldquo;le
    cuir dur&rdquo; [a thick skin] is no easy matter. However, I
    must go on being careful, try to hold on to what I have and to
    improve on it still.</p>

    <p>Above all, I should like you to tell me if you think it
    absurd of me to suggest that now might be a good time for us to
    sow the seeds of a future business. As far as my present work
    is concerned, I feel I can do better - however, I do need more
    air and space, in other words I must be able to spread my wings
    a little. Above all, above all, I still haven't enough models.
    I could soon produce work of higher quality, but my expenses
    would be heavier. Still, one should aim at something lofty,
    genuine, something distinguished, shouldn't one?</p>

    <p>The female figures I see among the people here impress me
    enormously - far more for the purpose of painting them than
    having them, though if the truth be told I should like
    both.</p>

    <p>I am again reading de Goncourt's book, it is first-rate. In
    the preface to Ch&eacute;rie, which you should read, there is
    an account of what the de Goncourts went through - and of how,
    at the end of their lives, they were pessimistic, yes - but
    also sure of themselves, knowing that they had <i>done
    something</i>, that their work would last. What fellows they
    were! if only we got on together better than we do now, if only
    we too could be in complete accord - we could be the same,
    couldn't we?</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">By the way, since, apr&egrave;s tout, I've been virtually
    fasting for 4 or 5 days at this year's end - send your letter
    no later than 1 January.</p>

    <p>You may well find it difficult to imagine, but it is a fact
    - when I receive the money my greatest craving will not be for
    food, though I shall have been fasting, but even more so for
    painting - and I shall immediately go on a hunt for models and
    continue until all the money has gone.</label><label content="food-and-drink.preference"> Meanwhile what will be
    keeping me going is my breakfast with the people where I live,
    and a cup of coffee and some bread in the cr&ecirc;merie in the
    evening. Supplemented, when I can, by a second cup of coffee
    and bread in the cr&ecirc;merie for my supper or else some rye
    bread I keep in my trunk. As long as I am painting that is more
    than enough, but when my models have left, a feeling of
    weakness does come over me.</label></p>

    <p>The models here appeal to me because they're so completely
    unlike the models in the country. And more especially because
    their character is completely different. And the contrast has
    given me some new ideas for the flesh colours in particular.
    And though I'm still not satisfied with what I've achieved with
    my last head, it does differ from the earlier ones.</p>

    <p>I think you value the truth enough for me to speak freely to
    you. For much the same reasons that if I paint peasant women I
    want them to be peasant women - so I want to get a whore's
    expression when I paint whores.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">That is precisely why a whore's head by Rembrandt struck me
    so forcefully. Because he had caught that mysterious smile in
    such an infinitely beautiful way, with a s&eacute;rieux
    [gravity] of his very own - the magician of magicians.</p>

    <p>This is something new for me, and I want to achieve it at
    all costs. Manet has done it and Courbet - well, sacrebleu,
    I've the same ambition too, the more so as I've felt the
    infinite beauty of the study of women by the giants of
    literature - Zola, Daudet, de Goncourt, Balzac - in the very
    marrow of my bones.</label></p>

    <p>Even Stevens fails to satisfy me, because his women are not
    like any I know personally. And those he chooses are not the
    most interesting there are, I find.</p>

    <p>Well, be that as it may - I want to get on &agrave; tout
    prix [at all costs], and - I want to be myself. I am feeling
    obstinate, too, and no longer care what people say about me or
    about my work.</p>

    <p>It seems more difficult to get a nude model here - the girl
    I used wouldn't do it, at any rate. Of course, that
    &ldquo;wouldn't&rdquo; is probably relative, but you certainly
    can't take it for granted. Still, the fact is she would be
    splendid.</p>

    <p>From a business point of view I can only say that we are in
    what people have already begun to call &ldquo;la fin d'un
    si&egrave;cle&rdquo; - that the women have the same charm as at
    the time of revolution - and just as much to say - and that one
    would be &ldquo;retir&eacute; du monde&rdquo; if one worked
    without them. It is the same everywhere, in the country as much
    as in the city - one has to take women into account if one
    wants to be up to date.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, have a happy New Year, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
