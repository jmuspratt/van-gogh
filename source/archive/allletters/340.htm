  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>I must just tell you about a trip to Zweeloo, the village
    where Liebermann stayed for a long time and did studies for his
    painting at the last Salon, the one with the washerwomen. Where
    Ter Meulen and Jules Bakhuyzen spent some time also.</p>

    <p>Imagine a trip across the heath at 3 o'clock in the morning
    in a small open cart (I went with the man with whom I'm
    lodging, who had to go to Assen market), along a road, or
    &ldquo;diek&rdquo; as they call it here, which had been banked
    up with mud instead of sand. It was even better than the
    barge.</p>

    <p>When it was just starting to get light, and the cocks were
    starting to crow everywhere round the huts scattered over the
    heath, everything, the few cottages we passed - surrounded by
    wispy poplars whose yellow leaves one could hear falling - a
    stumpy old tower in a little churchyard with an earth bank and
    a beech hedge, the flat scenery of heath or cornfields,
    everything was exactly like the most beautiful Corots. A
    stillness, a mystery, a peace as only he has painted it. When
    we arrived at Zweeloo at 6 o'clock in the morning it was still
    quite dark - I had seen the real Corots even earlier in the
    morning.</p>

    <p>The ride into the village was so beautiful. Enormous mossy
    roofs of houses, stables, covered sheepfolds, barns. The very
    broad-fronted houses here are set among oak trees of a superb
    bronze. Tones in the moss of gold-green, in the ground of
    reddish or bluish or yellowish dark lilac-greys, tones of
    inexpressible purity in the green of the little cornfields,
    tones of black in the wet tree trunks, standing out against the
    golden rain of swirling, teeming autumn leaves, which hang in
    loose clumps - as if they had been blown there, loose and with
    the light filtering through them - from the poplars, the
    birches, the limes and the apple trees.</p>

    <p>The sky smooth and bright, shining, not white but a barely
    detectable lilac, white vibrant with red, blue and yellow,
    reflecting everything and felt everywhere above one, hazy and
    merging with the thin mist below, fusing everything in a gamut
    of delicate greys.</p>

    <p>I could not find a single painter in Zweeloo, however, and
    people said they <i>never</i> turn up in the
    <i>winter</i>. Whereas I, <i>on the contrary</i>, hope
    to be there this winter. Since there were no painters, I
    decided not to wait for my landlord's return, but to walk back
    instead and do some drawings on the way. So I began to make a
    sketch of the little apple orchard where Liebermann did his
    large painting. And then back along the road we had driven down
    early in the morning. Right now the whole area round Zweeloo is
    nothing but young corn, sometimes as far as the eye can see,
    the greenest of greens I know. With a sky above of a delicate
    lilac-white producing an effect I think cannot be painted, but
    which, as I see it, is the keynote one must understand in order
    to find the key to other effects.</p>

    <p>A black stretch of earth, flat, unending, a clear sky of
    delicate lilac-white. The earth sprouts that young corn as if
    growing a mould of it. That's what the good, fertile lands of
    Drenthe really are - and all in a misty atmosphere. Think of
    <i>Brion's</i> Le dernier jour de l<i>a cr&eacute;ation</i> -
    well, yesterday it felt as if I understood the meaning of that
    painting. The poor soil of Drenthe is the same, except that the
    black earth is even blacker - like soot - not lilac-black like
    the furrows, and overgrown in a melancholy way with perpetually
    rotting heather and peat.</p>

    <p>I notice it everywhere - chance effects on that infinite
    background: in the peat moors, the turf huts; in the fertile
    areas, those most primitive hulks of farmhouses and sheepfolds
    with low, very low little walls and enormous mossy roofs. Oak
    trees all round them. Journeying through these parts for hour
    after hour, one feels that there really is nothing but that
    infinite earth, that mould of corn or heather, that infinite
    sky. Horses and men seem as small as fleas. One is unaware of
    anything else, however large it may be in itself; one knows
    only that there is earth and sky.</p>

    <p>However, in one's capacity of a little speck watching other
    little specks - leaving the infinite aside - one discovers that
    every little speck is a Millet. I passed a little old church,
    exactly, but exactly like The Church at Gr&eacute;ville in
    Millet's little painting in the Luxembourg. Here, instead of
    the small peasant with his spade, though, there was here a
    shepherd with a flock of sheep walking along the hedge. In the
    background was a vista, not of the sea, but of a sea of young
    corn, a sea of furrows instead of waves. The effect produced
    was the same. Then I saw ploughmen, hard at work, a sand cart,
    shepherds, road menders, dung carts. In a small roadside inn, I
    drew a little old woman at her spinning wheel, a small dark
    silhouette out of a fairy tale - a small dark silhouette
    against a bright window through which one saw the bright sky
    and a little path through the delicate green, and a few geese
    pecking at the grass.</p>

    <p>And then, when dusk fell, imagine the silence, the
    peace!</p>

    <p>Imagine <i>then</i> a short avenue of tall poplars with
    autumn leaves, imagine a wide muddy road, all black mud, with
    heath stretching to infinity on the right, heath stretching to
    infinity on the left, a couple of black triangular silhouettes
    of sod-built huts, the red glow from small fires shining
    through the small windows, with a few pools of dirty, yellowish
    water reflecting the sky, in which fallen trees lie rotting
    into peat. Imagine that sea of mud at dusk with a whitish sky
    overhead, thus everything black against white. And in that sea
    of mud a shaggy figure - the shepherd - and a mass of oval
    shapes, half wool, half mud, jostling one another, pushing one
    another out of the way - the flock. You see them coming, you
    stand in their midst, you turn around and follow them.
    Laboriously and reluctantly they work their way up the muddy
    road. The farm beckons in the distance, a few mossy roofs and
    piles of straw and peat among the poplars. The sheepfold is
    again like the silhouette of a triangle, the entrance dark. The
    door stands wide open like a dark cave. The light of the sky
    glimmers once more through the chinks of the boards behind it.
    The whole caravan, masses of wool and mud, disappears into that
    cave - the shepherd and a little woman with a lantern shut the
    doors behind them.</p>

    <p><art id=877>That return of the flock in the dusk</art> was the finale of the
    symphony I heard yesterday. <label content="food-and-drink.diet">The
    day passed like a dream, I had
    been so immersed in that heart-rending music all day that I had
    literally forgotten to eat and drink - I had had a slice of
    black bread and a cup of coffee in the little inn where I had
    drawn the spinning wheel. The day was over and from dawn till
    dusk, or rather from one night till the next, I had lost myself
    in that symphony. I came home and as I sat by the fire it
    occurred to me that I felt hungry, no, I realized I was
    ravenous.</label></p>

    <p>But now you can see what it is like here. One feels just as
    if one were at, say, an exhibition des cent chef-d'&oelig;vres.
    What does one bring back from such a day? Merely a number of
    rough sketches. Yet there is something else one brings back - a
    quiet delight in one's work.</p>

    <p>Be sure to write soon. It is Friday today, but your letter
    has not yet arrived, I'm waiting for it eagerly. It takes time
    to get it [the money] changed, too, because it has to go back
    again to Hoogeveen and then here again. We're not sure how it's
    going to work out, otherwise I should tell you now: perhaps the
    simplest thing would be to send the money once a month. In any
    case, write again soon. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
