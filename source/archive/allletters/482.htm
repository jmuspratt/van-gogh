    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I'm dropping you another line to tell you that, on
    reflection, I think it would be better simply for me to just
    get a rug and a mattress and make a bed on the studio floor. It
    will be so hot all summer that this will be more than enough.
    When winter comes we can see whether we have to get a bed or
    not.</p>

    <p>As for the bed at your place, I think that as far as
    conversation and company are concerned, having a painter to
    stay with you is good for both the painter and yourself. So
    that even when Koning leaves there may well be someone to take
    his place. Anyway, why don't you keep the bed with you?</p>

    <p>It is quite possible that as far as the house is concerned,
    I might find something even better either in Martigues, by the
    coast, or somewhere else. Only, what is so delightful about
    this studio is the garden opposite. But we would do well to
    wait before doing any repairs to it or furnishing it half
    decently - it would be wiser - especially as, if we should get
    cholera here in the summer, I might up and go to the country.
    This is a filthy town, with all its old streets!</p>

    <p>The women of Arles about whom there's so much talk, isn't
    there - do you want to know my real opinion of them? They are,
    no question about it, truly charming, but no longer what they
    must once have been. They are more often like a Mignard than a
    Mantegna, because they're now in decline. That doesn't prevent
    them from being beautiful, very beautiful, and I am talking
    here only of the type in the Roman type - rather boring and
    ordinary - but what exceptions there are! There are women like
    a Fragonard and - like Renoirs. And some that one cannot label
    with anything that's been done in painting so far.</p>

    <p>The best thing one could do here, from all points of view,
    would be to make portraits of women and children. Only I don't
    think that I am the man to do it, I'm not enough of a M. Bel
    Ami for that.</p>

    <p>But I should be extremely happy if this Bel Ami of the Midi,
    which Monticelli was not, but tried to be - who, I'm sure, is
    on his way, though I know it isn't to be me - I should be
    extremely happy, as I say, if a kind of Guy de Maupassant of
    painting came along to paint happy pictures of all these
    beautiful people and things round here.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">As for me, I shall go on working, and here and there
    something of my work will prove of lasting value - but who will
    there be to achieve for figure painting what Claude Monet has
    achieved for landscape? However, you must feel, as I do, that
    someone like that is on the way - Rodin? - he does not use
    colour - it won't be him. But the painter of the future will be
    <i>a colourist the like of which has never yet been seen</i>.
    Manet was getting there but, as you know, the impressionists
    have already made use of stronger colour than Manet has.</p>

    <p>I can't imagine this painter of the future living in small
    caf&eacute;s, setting to work with a lot of false teeth, and
    going to the Zouave's brothels, as I do.</label></p>

    <p>But I'm sure I am right to think that it will come in a
    later generation, and it is up to us to do all we can to
    encourage it, without question or complaint.</p>

    <p>Will you please tell Guillaumin that Russell wants to come
    and see him, and intends to buy another of his pictures? I am
    writing Russell today. I heard yesterday from McK. and the Dane
    that there is never anything good in the shop windows at
    Marseilles, and they think there is absolutely nothing doing
    there.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.neurological">I should very much like to look around a little myself, but
    being in no way anxious to fly into a rage, I shall wait till
    my nerves are steadier.</label></p>

    <p>In the very letter I had addressed wrongly I again said
    something about Bonger. It is probable that he dares to say so
    much because at the moment the Russians are having so much
    success at the Th&eacute;&agrave;tre Libre, etc. But this is no
    reason, is it, to try and make use of this success in order to
    denigrate the French? I have just reread Zola's Le [Au] Bonheur
    des Dames, and it seems to me more beautiful than ever.</p>

    <p>Now it is news indeed that Reid is back. I told Russell that
    as I was the one to introduce him, I felt it more or less my
    duty to explain the cause of the quarrel. That Reid was
    ambitious, and that, being short of money like all of us, he
    was beside himself when it was a question of earning money.
    That I looked upon these as involuntary acts (and consequently
    he was not responsible, but to be excused for them) committed
    by an overwrought nervous system.</p>

    <p>But that in Reid's character the vulgar merchant
    predominates over the distinguished artist. This does not mean
    getting even with Reid, but isn't it right to tell the truth? I
    feel sure that now it isn't any better, but rather worse.</p>

    <p>That friend of Russell's, McKnight, is a dry sort of person
    and not too sympathetic either - so much the worse if I should
    have the two of them against me. Yet I have not said anything
    about McKnight, though I suppose he has no more heart than
    Reid. If he could find his own painting, it would do him good,
    and it is not impossible that this will happen. He is still
    young, twenty-seven, I think.</p>

    <p>Supposing you agree, we need be in no hurry to fix up the
    studio. It will do well enough as it is meanwhile, and if I
    sleep there, as I've said, it will cost me nothing, I save 30
    francs at the hotel and I pay 15 for rent, so that there is
    clear profit.</p>

    <p>With a handshake for you and Koning; I have another
    drawing.</p>

    <p>Yours ever, Vincent</p>

    <p>I saw a heap of boxes for my purpose in the market and am
    going back to take measurements. Was the subject of the De
    Groux which you mention the same as that in the Brussels
    gallery, the &ldquo;B&eacute;n&eacute;dicit&eacute;&rdquo;?
    It's true what you say of Braekeleer. Have you heard that he
    suffered from a disease of the brain which left him impotent???
    I have heard this, but wasn't it only temporary? You talk of
    another one of his which I do not know.</p>
