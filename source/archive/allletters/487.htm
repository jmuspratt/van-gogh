  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am writing a little note again to tell you that I was at
    the gentleman whom the Arab Jew in Tartarin calls &ldquo;le
    Zouge de paix.&rdquo; Anyway, I got back 12 francs, and my landlord was
    reprimanded for having kept my trunk, since I did not refuse to pay, he had no
    right to keep it from me. If he had won his case, it would have been harmful to me, for he would not
    have failed to tell everyone that I could not or did not want to pay,
    and that he had been obliged to keep my trunk. Whereas now -
    for I left at the same time as he did - he said in the street
    that he had been angry, but that he had not meant to
    insult me.</p>

    <p>I think myself that this was probably just what he was
    trying to do, and seeing that I had had enough of his dump and
    that he could not force me to stay, he would have tried to
    blacken my reputation here. Very good. If I had wanted to
    get what is probably the fair reduction, I ought to have
    claimed more, for example for damages. If I let myself be had
    by the first comer here, you can imagine that soon I should not
    know where to turn.</p>

    <p>I have found a better restaurant where I
    can eat for 1 franc.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I am in better health now.</label></p>

    <p>Just now I have<art id=0408> two new </art>studies <art id=0409>like these</art>: you already
    have a drawing like of one of them, of <art id=1415>a farm by the high road among cornfields</art>.</p>

    <p><?showImage("589_V-T_4870");?>
    </p>

    <p>A meadow full of very yellow buttercups, a ditch with
    iris plants with green leaves and purple flowers, the town in the
    background, a few gray willows - a strip of blue sky.</p>

    <p>If they don't mow the meadow I'd like to do this study
    again, for the subject was very beautiful, and I had some
    trouble finding the composition. A little town surrounded by
    fields completely blooming with yellow and purple flowers; you know,
    it is a beautiful Japanese dream.</p>

    <p>I asked the cost of carriage for the consignment I sent
    by goods train, it will be 7 francs to the
    station in Paris. Seeing that I haven't much left, I did not pay in
    advance here, but if they ask more you must protest; the case
    is marked VV&amp;W. 1042.</p>

    <p>Yesterday and today we have the mistral again. I hope that
    my shipment will arrive before Tersteeg comes to
    Paris.</p>

    <p>With a handshake, write me soon.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
