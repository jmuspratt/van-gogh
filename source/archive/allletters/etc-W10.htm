  <body>
    <p>Miss Van Gogh,</p>

    <p>I acknowledge receipt of your kind letter, by which you do
    me too much honour, and I make haste to answer you that your
    amiable brother Vincent has quite recovered; he left the asylum
    today, the 7<sup>th</sup> inst. What caused my reply to be
    postponed for twenty-four hours is the fact that we kept each
    other company all day long, and I beg you to write him a
    letter. I have not let him read your letter, for he would be
    too chagrined to know that he has caused you so much grief.
    When you write him, please do not let him know that you are
    informed of the causes of his distemper, and tell him that you
    have learned through the mediation of your brother in Paris
    that he has been indisposed, and that you are very happy to
    hear that he has recovered.</p>

    <p>We talked at great length about you as well as about your
    mother today.</p>

    <p>Many thanks for the good wishes you expressed with regard to
    my wife and our little girl. Please set your mind quite at ease
    as to the health of my good friend Vincent; I go to see him as
    often as my work permits and if something should happen again,
    I should inform you as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>I do not think I deserve all the words of gratitude which
    you address to me, but I shall always do my utmost to deserve
    the esteem of my friend Vincent as well as of those who are
    dear to him.</p>

    <p>Please give my respectful regards, along with those of my
    family, to Madame your mother.</p>

    <p>I beg you, Miss, to accept the sincere regards of the friend
    of your worthy brother Vincent.</p>
