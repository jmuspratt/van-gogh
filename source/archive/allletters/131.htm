    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I write to you in a great hurry; won't it soon be time for
    you to go to Paris? If so, write to me the day and the hour,
    and in all probability I shall see you at the station.</p>

    <p>If you have time to stay a day, or more or less, I should be
    very happy; I should have some drawings to show you, types from
    here; it wouldn't be worth while for you to leave the train for
    those alone, but you would easily find something to attract you
    in the scenery and in the curious aspect of things - everything
    in this neighbourhood has such a picturesque character.</p>

    <p>Have you read Les Temps Difficiles [Hard Times] by Dickens?
    I have written the title in French because there exists a very
    good French translation for 1fr. 25, in the Hachette edition:
    Biblioth&egrave;que des meilleurs Romans &eacute;trangers.
    [Library of the Best Foreign Novels.] It is a masterpiece, the
    author in this work has painted a moving and sympathetic
    portrait of a working man called Stephen Blackpool,</p>

    <p>I was in Brussels recently, and in Maria Hoorebeke and in
    Tournay, partly on foot.</p>

    <p>For the present I am at the following address: M. Frank,
    Evangelist at Cuesmes (near Mons) au Marais.</p>

    <p>There have been many thunderstorms here lately. Do try, dear
    fellow, and arrange to stay over an hour or so.</p>

    <p>Lately I have been at a studio again, namely at the Reverend
    Pietersen's, who paints in the manner of Schelfhout or
    Hoppenbrouwers, and has good ideas about art.</p>

    <p>He asked me for one of my sketches, a miner type. Often I
    draw far into the night, to keep some souvenir and to
    strengthen the thoughts raised involuntarily by the aspect of
    things here.</p>

    <p>But, boy, I have no more time. I have written to Mr.
    Tersteeg to thank him for the box of paints he sent me, and the
    sketchbook, which is almost half full already.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">In Brussels I bought from a Jewish book dealer another big
    sketchbook of old Dutch paper.</label></p>

    <p>Shall I see you? How welcome you would be. I promise you
    Dickens's Les Temps Difficiles if you will come to fetch it;
    otherwise I will send it to you when I have a chance. &Agrave;
    Dieu. A handshake in thought, and believe me always,</p>

    <p>Yours truly, Vincent</p>
