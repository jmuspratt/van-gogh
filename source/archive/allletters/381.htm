  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Here are two photographs of the weavers - next week I hope
    to send you two more sketches for Hermans' decorations.</p>

    <p>You know well enough that your criticism of this past year
    and a half only seems like some kind of vitriol to me. But
    never suppose I don't know it is possible to protect oneself
    from such vitriol by a sort of leather which it cannot pierce
    so easily, and that as soon as one's hide is tanned so as to
    keep it out, it does not matter so much - so - what do I
    care?</p>

    <p>Apart from this I believe you mean well. So what more do you
    want?</p>

    <p>But I declare that it is not in the least <i>my</i> fault if
    the money you give me yields such a poor interest, not only to
    you, but also a poor interest to me. The former - that it
    yields a poor interest to you - grieves me more than the
    latter, it's yielding a poor interest to me too.</p>

    <p>Things may improve, you will say - yes, but in that case not
    only I but you too would have to change a good deal. I just
    want to tell you that this winter, perhaps next month, I intend
    to leave here for a time; I have thought of Antwerp - I have
    thought of The Hague.</p>

    <p>But during the last few days I have thought of something
    that is perhaps even better. In the first place I now want at
    all events some city life, some change of surroundings, having
    been either in Drenthe or in Nuenen for a full year or more.
    And I believe this will be a good distraction for me, for my
    spirits in general, which have not been and could not be as
    cheerful as I should like, especially recently.</p>

    <p>Look here now, the sculptor Strack&eacute; lives in
    Bois-le-Duc; at the same time he is director of the drawing
    academy there. I saw a terre cuite by a pupil of his, and heard
    on that occasion that Strack&eacute; is not at all unkind or
    indifferent to anyone who practices art in this vicinity. That
    at Bois-le-Duc he has several models for the academy, and that
    there are people to whom he affords the opportunity to draw
    from the nude or to model in clay.</p>

    <p>Probably, however, one would have to pay <i>the model</i>
    oneself, but that is not so very expensive, and then one has a
    spacious room for which one doesn't pay <i>anything.</i> I am
    going to see for myself how things are, and then it is not
    impossible that, just as Breitner, for instance, went to
    Cormon, I shall go to Strack&eacute;. It is in the
    neighbourhood, and would be the cheapest thing too.</p>

    <p>I have bought a very beautiful book on anatomy, Anatomy for
    Artists; by John Marshall. It was in fact very expensive, but
    it will be of use to me all my life, for it is very good. I
    have also what they use at l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and what
    they use in Antwerp.</p>

    <p>But such things make great holes in my pocket. I tell you
    this only to make you understand that my not paying Father and
    Mother for my board while I stay here is not because I do not
    want to pay, but because I have had many expenses which I for
    my part don't consider superfluous.</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">The key to many things is the thorough knowledge of the
    human body, but it costs money to learn it. Besides, I am quite
    sure that <i>colour</i>, that <i>chiaroscuro</i>,
    that <i>perspective</i>, that <i>tone</i> and that
    <i>drawing</i>, in short, everything has fixed laws
    which one must and can study, like chemistry or algebra. This
    <i>is far from being</i> the easiest view of things, and one
    who says, &ldquo;Oh, one must know it all instinctively,&rdquo;
    takes it very easy indeed. If that were enough! But it isn't
    enough, for even if one knows ever so much by <i>instinct</i>,
    that is just the reason to try ever so hard to pass from
    <i>instinct</i> to <i>reason</i>. That's what I think.</label></p>

    <p><label content="business.sales">You must not imagine that I have earned anything by doing
    that work for Hermans; the first day I got two bills for the
    stretchers, canvases and a number of tubes, amounting to
    <i>more</i> than I had received from him to pay for them. I
    told him that I did not want these bills to remain unpaid, and
    asked him if he wanted to have them put in his name or if he
    would pay me something in advance. Oh no, he said, <i>let it
    wait, they need not be paid at once</i>.</p>

    <p>I said, Yes, <i>they must be paid at once</i>. Then he gave
    me 25 guilders.</label></p>

    <p>Then came all my other expenses for models, not counting my
    time, work, etc.; but since then I have not seen any of his
    money, <i>nor have I asked for it</i>. On the contrary, because
    my work pleased him from first to last, I consider myself
    already sufficiently paid, if need be. Besides, the pictures
    remain my property, and I must judge for myself what I am
    willing to lay out for them. But enough of this, since those
    stretchers, canvases, etc., I have had at least 20 guilders'
    worth of expenses, perhaps even more, and have not even got
    them back. But the man is satisfied and pleased with me. Is it
    then good policy to ask for money? One must be very careful in
    this, in my opinion, <i>just when people are satisfied, one
    must lower the price rather than raise</i> it. Especially when,
    after all, the sum is not so considerable that receiving it or
    not makes that much difference. If I succeed, it will perhaps
    be for the very reason that I work more cheaply than others,
    and make it easy for the art lovers.</p>

    <p>As to Hermans, <i>he is very good</i>, and a man to remain
    on good terms with, and he is certainly rich, but - has always
    been stingy rather than generous. Quite different from a real
    miser, but <i>after all, I am earning</i> less, <i>much less
    than nothing</i>.</p>

    <p>But notwithstanding this, I for my part have been very kind
    and obliging to him. I find in him a very pleasant, jovial
    <i>friend</i>, and it is really touching to see how a man of
    sixty tries hard to learn to paint with the same youthful
    enthusiasm as if he were twenty.</p>

    <p>What he makes is not beautiful, but he works hard, and has
    already copied four of my six compositions, in quite a
    different sentiment, and it has something medieval, something
    like Peasant Breughel.</p>

    <p>You once told me that I should always be isolated; I don't
    believe it, you are decidedly mistaken in my character
    there.</p>

    <p>And I do not at all intend to think and live less
    passionately than I do. By no means - I may meet with rebuffs,
    I may often be mistaken - often be wrong - but that only as far
    as it goes - basically I am not wrong.</p>

    <p>Neither the best pictures nor the best people have no faults
    or partis pris.</p>

    <p>And I repeat, though these times may seem tame, they aren't
    really. I also positively deny that my assertion of certain
    parties still being as strongly opposed to each other in '84 as
    in '48 should be <i>exaggerated</i>. It is <i>something quite
    different</i> from that ditch of yours, I assure you - I am
    speaking of the parties now, rather than of you and me in
    particular, but you and I also belong <i>somewhere</i>, don't
    we? - standing either on the right or on the left, whether we
    are <i>conscious</i> of it or not.</p>

    <p>I for my part have at all events a parti pris if you like,
    and if you think you, for your part can manage to stand neither
    on the right nor on the left, I take the liberty of doubting
    most strongly its feasibility. And especially the practical
    use.</p>

    <p>I have had a fairly good letter from Utrecht, she has
    recovered enough to go to The Hague for a time. But I am still
    far from easy about her. The tone of her letters is much more
    self-confident, much more correct, and less prejudiced than
    when I first knew her. At the same time, something like the
    wail of a bird whose nest has been robbed; she is feeling
    perhaps less indignant than I toward society, but she too sees
    in it &ldquo;the boys that rob the nests,&rdquo; who do it for
    fun and laugh about it.</p>

    <p>But now there is a piece of news, that the pastor at
    Helvoirt has died, so that there is now a vacancy in that
    parish. I think it probable that they want to get Father back
    there, at least that the family at Helvoirt is going to sound
    Father out on the subject. But seeing that it was only the day
    before yesterday that the dear reverend gentleman over yonder
    dropped dead, I do not know in the least whether they are going
    to call Father or not. However I think it highly probable.</p>

    <p>Father is not going to accept the call, this much is
    certain.</p>

    <p>As to what I call barricade and you call ditch, it can't be
    helped, but there is an old civilization that, in my opinion,
    is declining through its own fault - there is a new
    civilization that has been born, and is growing, and will grow
    more.</p>

    <p>In short, there are <i>revolutionary</i> and
    <i>anti-revolutionary</i> principles.</p>

    <p>Now I ask you whether you yourself have not often noticed
    that the policy of wavering between the old and the new isn't
    tenable? Just think this over. Sooner or later it ends with
    one's standing frankly either on the right or on the left.</p>

    <p><i>It is no ditch</i>. And I repeat, then it was '48, now it
    is '84; then there was a barricade of paving stones - now it is
    not of stones, but all the same a barricade as to the
    incompatibility of old and new - oh, it certainly is there in
    '84 as well as in '48. Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
