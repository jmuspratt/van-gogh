  <body>
    <p>My dear Bernard,</p>

    <p>I just received your last letter. You are quite right to see
    that those Negresses were heart-rending. You are quite right
    not to think such a thing innocent.</p>

    <p>I have just read a book - not a beautiful one and not well
    written for that matter - about the Marquesas Islands, but sad
    enough when it tells of the extermination of a whole native
    tribe - cannibal in the sense that once a month, let us say, an
    individual got eaten - what does it matter!</p>

    <p>The whites, very Christian and all that&hellip;in order to
    put a stop to this barbarity (?), really not very
    cruel&hellip;could find no better means than the extermination
    of the tribe of cannibal natives as well as the tribe against
    which the latter fought (in order to provide themselves from
    time to time with the necessary palatable prisoners of
    war).</p>

    <p>After which they annexed the two isles, which then became
    unutterably lugubrious!!</p>

    <p>Those tattooed races, Negroes, Indians, all of them, all,
    all are disappearing or degenerating. And the horrible white
    man with his bottle of alcohol, his money and his syphilis -
    when shall we see the end of him? The horrible white man with
    his hypocrisy, his greediness and his sterility.</p>

    <p>And those savages were so gentle and so loving!</p>

    <p>You are damned right to think of Gauguin. That is high
    poetry, <art id=egresses>those Negresses</art>, and everything his hands make has a
    gentle, pitiful, astonishing character. People don't understand
    him yet, and it pains him so much that he does not sell
    anything, just like other true poets.</p>

    <p>My dear comrade, I should have written you before, only I
    had a lot of things to attend to. I have sent a first batch of
    studies to my brother, that's number one. <label content="health.general">And I have been
    having trouble with my health, that's number two. </label>And number
    three is that I have rented a house, painted yellow outside,
    whitewashed within, in the full sun (four rooms).</p>

    <p>On top of all that I am working on new studies.<label content="health.fatigue"> And in the
    evening I was often too beat to write. That's why my answer has
    been delayed.</label></p>

    <p>Listen, that sonnet about the women of the boulevard has
    some good in it, but it isn't the real thing, the end is banal.
    A &ldquo;<i>sublime</i> woman&rdquo;...I don't know what you
    mean by that, neither do you when it comes right down to it.
    Furthermore:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    <i>Dans le clan des vieux et des jeunes maraude</i><br>

    <i>Ceux qu'elle ammenera coucher le soir, tr&egrave;s
    tard</i><br>

    <p></p>

    [Ensnaring among the tribe of the old and young ones<br>

    Those whom she will take to bed with her that night, very
    late.]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>Something like this is not characteristic at all, for the
    women of our boulevard - the little one - usually sleep alone
    by night, for they have five or six hauls during the day or in
    the evening. and tr&egrave;s tard there is that honorable
    carnivore, their maquereau [pimp], who comes and takes them
    home, but he does not sleep with them (or rarely). The worn-out
    stupefied woman usually goes to bed alone and sleeps a leaden
    sleep.</p>

    <p>But if you alter two or three lines, it will be all
    right.</p>

    <p>What have you painted recently? As for me, I have done <art id=0410>a
    still life of a blue-enameled iron coffeepot, a royal-blue cup
    and saucer, a milk jug with pale cobalt and white checks, a cup
    with orange and blue patterns on a white ground, a blue
    majolica jug decorated with green, brown and pink flowers and
    leaves. The whole on a blue tablecloth, against a yellow
    background, and among this crockery two oranges and three
    lemons. So it is a variation of blues, livened up by a series
    of yellows that go as far as orange.</art></p>

    <p>Then I have another <art id=0384>still life, lemons in a basket against a
    yellow background.</art> Further <art id=0409>a view of Arles. Of
    the town itself one sees only some red roofs and a tower, the
    rest is hidden by the green foliage of fig trees, far away in
    the background, and a narrow strip of blue sky above it. The
    town is surrounded by immense meadows all abloom with countless
    buttercups - a sea of yellow - in the foreground these meadows
    are divided by a ditch full of violet irises</art>.
    They were mowing the grass while I was painting, so it is only
    a study and not the finished picture that I had intended to do.
    But what a subject, hein! That sea of yellow with a hand of
    violet irises, and in the background that coquettish little
    town of the pretty women! Then two studies of roadsides - later
    - done with the mistral raging.
    If you were not expecting my prompt reply I should make you a
    sketch. Keep your courage up, good luck. A handshake. I am
    exhausted tonight. I shall write you again in the next few
    days, more at my ease.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>P.S. The portrait of a woman in your last letter but one is
    very pretty. My address: 2, Place Lamartine, Arles.</p>
