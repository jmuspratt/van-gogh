    <p>My dear comrade Bernard,</p>

    <p>We have worked a lot these days, and in the meantime I read
    Le r&ecirc;ve by Zola, and because of this I had hardly any
    time to write. Gauguin interests me very much as a man - very
    much.<br>
     For a long time now it has seemed to me that in our nasty
    profession of painting we are most sorely in need of men with
    the hands and the stomachs of workmen. More natural tastes -
    more loving and more charitable temperaments - than the
    decadent dandies of the Parisian boulevards have.<br>
     Well, here we are without the slightest doubt in the presence
    of a virgin creature with savage instincts. With Gauguin blood
    and sex prevail over ambition.<br>
     But enough, you have seen him at close range for a longer time
    than I have; I only wanted to tell you in a few words what my
    first impressions are. <label content="business.co-op">Moreover, I do not think you will be
    greatly amazed if I tell you that our discussions tend to treat
    of the terrible subject of an association of certain painters.
    This association must or may have, yes or no, a commercial
    character. We haven't arrived at any conclusion yet, nor have
    we set foot on a new continent.</label><br>
     As for me, with my presentiment of a new world, I firmly
    believe in the possibility of an immense renaissance of art.
    Whoever believes in this new art will have the tropics for a
    home.<br>
     I have the impression that we ourselves serve as no more than
    intermediaries. And that only the next generation will succeed
    in living in peace. Apart from all this, our duties and the
    possibilities of action for us can become clearer to us only by
    experience and nothing else. I am a bit surprised at the fact
    that I have not yet received the studies you promised me in
    exchange for mine.<br>
     Now something that will interest you - we have made some
    excursions to the brothels, and it is probable that in the end
    we shall often go and work there.<br>
     At the moment Gauguin is working on a canvas of the same <art id=0463>night
    cafe I painted too</art>, but with figures seen in
    the brothels. It promises to turn out beautiful.<br>
     I myself have done two studies of <art id=0486>the fall of leaves</art> in <art id=0487>an
    avenue of poplars</art>, and <art id=0568>a third
    study of this whole avenue, entirely yellow</art>.<br>
     I must say I cannot understand why I don't do studies after
    the figure, seeing that it is often so difficult for me to
    imagine the painting of the future theoretically as otherwise
    than a new succession of powerful, simple portraitists,
    comprehensible to the general public. Well, perhaps I shall go
    do the brothels before long. I leave a page open for Gauguin,
    who will probably write to you too, and I heartily shake your
    hand in thought.</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Milliet, the 2<sup>nd</sup> lieutenant of the Zouaves, has
    gone to Africa; he would like you to write him a letter one of
    these days.</p>

    <p>[Underneath this letter there is a postscript by Gauguin, in
    which he says that he agrees with Vincent's idea of a new
    generation of painters in the tropics. He intends to go there
    as soon as he gets a chance. The two pictures by Vincent of the
    falling leaves are hanging in his room, and Bernard would think
    them fine.]</p>
