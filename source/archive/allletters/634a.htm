  <body>
    <p>My dear Mr. Ginoux,</p>

    <p>This is to ask you to be so kind as to send my two beds,
    which are still with you, by goods train.</p>

    <p>I think it will be wise to empty the pallets, for buying new
    straw will not be more expensive than the money paid for
    carriage.</p>

    <p>The rest of the furniture, goodness yes, there is the
    mirror, for instance, which I should like to have. Will you
    kindly paste strips of paper across the glass to prevent its
    breaking? - but the two chests of drawers, the chairs, tables,
    you may keep for your trouble, and if there are extra expenses,
    please let me know.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I greatly regret I fell ill on the day I came to Arles to
    say goodbye to you all - after that I was ill for two months
    without being able to work. However, at present I am quite well
    again.</label></p>

    <p>But I am going to return to the North, and so, my dear
    friends, I vigorously shake your hands in thought, as well as
    the hands of the neighbors, and believe me when I say that over
    there I shall often think of you all, for what Mrs. Ginoux said
    is true - if you are friends, you are friends for a long time.
    If you should happen to see the Roulins, you will surely not
    forget to remember me to them.</p>

    <p>So I stop for now, hoping that Mrs. Ginoux has quite
    recovered from her indisposition, and with another handshake, I
    am</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Please send the beds to:</p>

    <p>Monsieur V. van Gogh, Paris</p>

    <p>By goods train, to be called for at the station</p>

    <p>I do not intend to stay in Paris longer than a fortnight at
    the most, after that I am going to work in the country, so
    kindly take care to add to the address:</p>

    <p><i>To be called for at the station.</i></p>

    <p>Otherwise, if you want to write to me, my address in Paris
    is: 19, Boulevard Montmartre -(c/o) Maison Boussod &amp;
    Cie.</p>
  </body>
