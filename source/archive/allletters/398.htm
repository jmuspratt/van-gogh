  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am still greatly under the impression of what has just
    happened - so I have worked on quietly these two Sundays.</p>

    <p>Enclosed you will find a scratch of a man's head and of a
    still life with honesty, in the same style as the one you took
    with you; in the foreground are Father's tobacco pouch and his
    pipe. If you care to have it, you may of course, and
    welcome.</p>

    <p>Mother is looking well, and for the present the many letters
    she has to write distract her somewhat. But of course she feels
    her loss heavily.</p>

    <p>I do not know whether you remember how in January, when the
    fields were covered with snow, and the sun rose fiery red out
    of the mist, I wrote you that I had hardly ever begun a new
    year in a more despondent mood.</p>

    <p>The fact is that there will be much trouble in store for us
    all. Of course you will understand that it isn't for my own
    pleasure that I shall go and live in the studio. It makes
    things more complicated for me again, but I am quite sure that
    it is better for the others if I leave. Especially in view of
    Mother's intention to take in as a boarder somebody who wants
    to stay in the country for his or her health, if it can be done
    - or, if this should not prove so easy, they will at all events
    be freer in the matter of receiving guests, etc.<label content="attitude.sisters"> However, I
    still very much deplore the incident with Anna which decided me
    on this. What she told you does not alter anything of what she
    reproached me with, however absurd these reproaches were, as
    well as her unfounded suspicions with regard to certain things
    of the future. She has not told me she took them back. Well,
    you understand that I simply shrug my shoulders at such things,
    and for that matter, more and more I let everybody think of me
    what they like, and say of me, and do, under certain
    circumstances, too.</label></p>

    <p>But consequently I have no choice. After such a beginning
    one is forced to take measures in order to avoid such
    occurrences in the future. So I am firmly resolved.</p>

    <p>Probably Mother will go to Leyden next year. Then I shall be
    the only one of us left in Brabant.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">And it doesn't seem at all improbable that I shall stay
    there for the rest of my days. In fact, I have no other wish
    than to live deep, deep in the heart of the country, and to
    paint rural life. I feel that my work lies there, so I shall
    keep my hand to the plough, and cut my furrow steadily.</label></p>

    <p>I believe that you think differently about it, and that
    perhaps you prefer my taking another course, and settling
    elsewhere. But I sometimes think that you have more feeling for
    what can be done in the city, whereas I, on the contrary, feel
    more at home in the country.</p>

    <p>But I shall still have a hard time of it before I can make
    people accept my pictures.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, I am not going to let myself be discouraged.</p>

    <p>I remember what I once read of how seventeen pictures of
    Delacroix's were refused, &ldquo;dix-sept
    refus&eacute;s,&rdquo; as he told his friends straight out.</p>

    <p>I was thinking today what damned brave fellows they were,
    those pioneers. But the battle must be carried on even at
    present, and I will carry on my own fight for all the little I
    may be worth.</p>

    <p>And so, Theo, I hope we shall continue on both sides what we
    started anew; while waiting for, or rather, toiling on more
    important compositions, I shall send you the studies fresh from
    the cottages.</p>

    <p>Of course, people will speak of unfinished, or ugly, etc.,
    etc., but - my idea is <i>to show them by all
    means</i>.</p>

    <p>I personally have the firm conviction that there are a few
    people who, having been drawn into the city and kept bound
    there, yet retaining unfaded impressions of the country, and
    remain all their lives homesick for the fields and the
    peasants. Such art lovers are sometimes struck by the sincerity
    in a picture, and what repulses others does not trouble
    them.</p>

    <p>I myself remember how I used to walk for hours in the city,
    looking at the show windows, to get a glimpse of some bit of
    the country, never mind what.</p>

    <p>We are now in the very beginning of showing the work; I feel
    sure that by and by we shall find some friends for it.
    Circumstances impel us and gradually we shall be able to show
    better things. For the moment I am strongly preoccupied with
    settling my colour bill; besides, I need canvas, paint and
    brushes.</p>

    <p>As Father's death has caused you many extra expenses, I have
    thought of the following arrangement; in case you should not be
    able to give me the extra allowance which I used to receive
    every spring and summer and which I cannot possibly do without,
    don't you think it would be fair if I reserved for myself a sum
    of, for instance, 200 guilders as my share of the inheritance,
    which for the rest I gladly leave to the younger ones, and
    shall be able to do if you continue to help me?</p>

    <p>In fact, I do not consider it as if <i>I</i> left them my
    share, but that it is you who make it possible for them to get
    my portion.</p>

    <p>If I go to live in the studio, it is absolutely necessary to
    have the closet made, for instance, for now I haven't the
    smallest place to put my things away, and some improvements
    must be made as to the light. To have to move now would be as
    bad for me as if the house were burned down; I think with
    patience and perseverance we can stay on our feet.</p>

    <p>As soon as I am settled in the studio I think I shall take
    up doing watercolours regularly every evening, it is not
    possible at home in the living room.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.sisters">As to Anna, you must not think that I shall go on resenting
    a thing like this or bearing a grudge - but it is a pity that
    they think they are doing Mother a service by such a thing -
    this is to be regretted - it is foolish and unwise. As long as
    Mother and Wil are here, nothing of an odious nature will
    happen between them and me, this I firmly believe.</label> Only it is
    an established fact that Mother is unable to grasp the fact
    that painting is <i>a faith</i>, and that it imposes <i>the
    duty</i> to disregard public opinion - and that in painting one
    conquers by <i>perseverance</i> and not by making
    <i>concessions</i> - and that &ldquo;I cannot give thee the
    faith&rdquo; - this is exactly what is the matter between her
    and me - as it was to Father, and remained so. Oh dear.</p>

    <p>Till then, I shall continue to work from the model in the
    evening also.</p>

    <p>This week I intend to start that composition of those
    peasants around a dish of potatoes in the evening, or - perhaps
    I shall make daylight of it, or both, or &ldquo;neither of the
    two&rdquo; you will say. But whether it may succeed or not, I
    am going to begin the studies for the various figures. Goodbye,
    with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
