  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>This time I have to tell you something about a visit from
    Mr. Tersteeg. This morning he came here and saw Sien and the
    children. I could have wished that he had shown a kind face to
    a young little mother just out of childbed. But that was asking
    too much.</p>

    <p>Dear Theo, he spoke to me in a way which you can perhaps
    imagine.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;What was the meaning of that woman and that
    child?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;How could I think of living with a woman, and
    children into the bargain?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Wasn't it just as ridiculous as driving my own
    four-in-hand all over town?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>To which I answered that this was certainly quite a
    different case.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Had I gone mad? It was certainly the result of an
    unsound mind and temperament.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I told him that I had just received the most reassuring
    information from persons more competent than he, namely the
    physicians at the hospital, as much about the condition of my
    body as about the power of my mind to stand exertion.</p>

    <p>So he jumped from one thing to another, brought in my father
    and, just fancy, even my uncle at Prinsenhage!!!</p>

    <p>He would do something about it. He would write.</p>

    <p>Dear Theo, for the woman's sake, for my own, I restrained
    myself, I kept my temper. I answered his, in my opinion, too
    indiscreet questions curtly and dryly, perhaps a little too
    mildly; but I preferred being too mild to losing my temper. By
    and by he calmed down a little. I asked him if it wouldn't be
    ridiculous if the people at home received an indignant letter
    from him, and then soon after a kind request from me to come
    and visit me at my expense, so as to speak about the same
    matter. That was not without effect. At least he looked up and
    asked, &ldquo;Did I intend to write myself?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Need you ask?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Of course I will,
    but you must admit that now is a very inopportune moment, as
    they are in the bustle of moving at home, <sup>1</sup> and as
    the woman's condition is such that the least emotion might
    bring about a prolapse of the womb which might be incurable. To
    cause her any anxiety, strain or nervousness now would be
    murder.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Oh! then of course he would not write, but again he talked
    about my being just as foolish as a man who wanted to drown
    himself, and his wanting to save me from it. I said that I did
    not doubt his good intentions, and therefore I tried not to be
    angry at his words, though such a conversation was very
    disagreeable to me. And at last, because I showed that I
    definitely wanted to avoid further discussion, he went
    away.</p>

    <p>I told him only that I had written you all about it. That
    calmed him somewhat.</p>

    <p>I tried to draw his attention to the drawings, but he just
    looked around and said, &ldquo;Oh! Those are the old
    ones.&rdquo; There were some new ones, but he did not seem to
    notice them. Well, you know you have most of the new ones, and
    C. M. has some of them, etc. he was hasty in everything; he was
    sure of just one thing: I was a fool and everything I did was
    wrong.</p>

    <p>I ask you, how is it possible to talk to anyone who acts
    like that, and what can be the use of it? It is just what I am
    afraid of, unsympathetic, domineering, indelicate and
    indiscreet meddling in my most intimate and private affairs. No
    man will stand for that. So though I did not lose my temper, I
    am very angry with Mr. Tersteeg, and will have nothing to do
    with him nor speak with him again as long as he is in that
    policeman-like mood. I am writing you about it at once.</p>

    <p>You know, I will not hide from you that for Sien and for the
    little child and for myself it is desirable that such scenes do
    not occur again. Upsetting the woman is the same thing as
    dealing her a <i>hard blow</i>. I cannot repeat this often
    enough. After all, she is weak and very sensitive. A little
    thing may spoil her milk, and even cause far worse things, at
    least during the next six weeks.</p>

    <p>I think he is capable of causing all kinds of miseries
    through his untimely interference. Can't his causing trouble
    and worry at home and at Prinsenhage (and Prinsenhage has
    nothing, absolutely nothing to do with it) be stopped??? I am
    on good terms with Father and Mother now, and who knows but
    that he will spoil everything again? I shall write myself as
    soon as possible, but how confoundedly mean it is of Tersteeg
    to make so much trouble. And over whom? - a poor weak woman
    only a few weeks out of childbed. I think it mean, but he does
    not feel that way about it; with him it is always, always the
    same thing, <i>money</i>. It seems he knows and worships no
    other god. Personally, I feel that one must be good and kind to
    women, children and the weak; I have a sort of respect for
    them, I am moved by them.</p>

    <p>Then he uttered one other abusive remark - I should make
    that woman unhappy, etc. I said he was not capable of judging
    this now, and I asked him not to repeat such a thing. Sien
    loves me and I love Sien; we can and will live together on what
    I should otherwise have lived on alone - we will save and
    economize in all respects and as much as possible - you know
    well enough I have already told you this.</p>

    <p>At least you know more about the matter than Tersteeg, but
    you know Sien too little to understand how much we love each
    other, and how well we get on together. I cannot repeat to you
    often enough, brother, how my whole future depends on it. For a
    man may recover once from disappointment and injury in love -
    and in his business and plans. But that must not happen too
    often. Now I have recovered or am recovering in body and soul,
    and so is Sien, but it might be fatal if we were knocked on the
    head again, so to speak. But there is an understanding between
    Sien and me; in the extreme case of their trying to force us,
    that is, if we cannot live here together, we will at least
    leave the country together. The chances of certain death are
    ten to one if one has no money and is not strong, but we would
    prefer that to being separated. So just think it over and try
    to prevent, if you possibly can, my being thwarted too much by
    Tersteeg or other persons.</p>

    <p>I myself am not yet so strong that I can defend myself the
    way I could at another time. By and by, very slowly, I must
    become absorbed in my work again, but I really cannot stand
    visits like the one this morning.</p>

    <p>If Tersteeg and others had their own way, they would of
    course tear Sien and me apart. That is what they want, and they
    would not hesitate at violence. Our staying together depends
    entirely on the monthly allowance from you. For myself, I would
    refuse your allowance if you took Tersteeg's view. I will not
    leave Sien; I should be a broken man without her, and then I
    should also be ruined in my work and everything; then I should
    never get over it, and not wanting to be a nuisance or trouble
    to you any longer, I should say, Theo, I am a broken man, and
    everything is lost; it's no use your helping me any more.
    <i>Living with the woman</i>, I have good courage, and then I
    say, The money from you will make a good painter of me. With
    Sien I shall work with all my strength and energy, but without
    her I shall have to give up. So that's the way things are.</p>

    <p>You have proved you understood me more and have treated me
    infinitely better than others did so often. I hope it will be
    the same this time.</p>

    <p>In many respects there is real sympathy between you and me,
    and it seems to me, Theo, that all your trouble and all my
    trouble will not be in vain. You have always helped me. I have
    continued working, and now while I am recovering, I feel that
    new forces are developing. See, I think, what is between you
    and me is more serious than Tersteeg's anger, and cannot be
    spoiled by his or others' interference. But to keep order and
    peace we must try to stop this interference quietly. You must
    excuse my being rather upset by it. It was the first painful
    hour for Sien and me since our return from the hospital. But we
    shall not mind it any more if you still approve of us, and we
    shall not allow ourselves to be upset by it.</p>

    <p>Write us soon, for I am anxiously awaiting a letter from
    you. I will not let my mind be filled with care and anxiety
    because my recovery depends on my remaining calm. Otherwise I
    am pretty well; the woman and the child are so good, so quiet
    and dear that one cannot fail to be cheered by it. But Sien
    seemed to wither when she heard Tersteeg talk, and so did
    I.</p>

    <p><label content="health.venereal">I saw the doctor again, and he gave me some medicine to
    hasten my recovery as much as possible. I am getting stronger
    and the fever is slowly going away.</label></p>

    <p>Now, because of Tersteeg, I should like to send my letter to
    Father and Mother a little sooner, though I should have
    preferred to wait until later. As soon as you have sent the
    money, about the twentieth, I shall write home, but I would
    much rather have waited until they had moved and Sien had quite
    recovered. And even now I should much rather wait, but I am
    afraid Tersteeg will beat me to it. Sending Father the money
    for the journey is a proof of my good will, I think, and a
    little attention which I hope will make them understand that I
    appreciate them.</p>

    <p>So write soon, and if this might bind us more firmly
    together, brother, and cause us to understand each other better
    and have more confidence in each other instead of being
    separated by Tersteeg's interference, or anyone else's, then I
    do not regret this morning's incident.</p>

    <p>Whatever he is to others - and I am quite willing to believe
    that he is a better man at heart - to me he is unsupportable.
    If Tersteeg were to get his way, I should be unhappy and lost.
    I believe he would look on quite cold-bloodedly while Sien was
    drowning or some such thing, not lifting a finger, and say it
    was beneficial to civilized society.</p>

    <p>As long as I drown at the same time, I don't care. But we
    felt distinctly enough that her life and my life are as one,
    when we met again in that hospital by the side of the baby's
    little cradle.</p>

    <p>Hello, brother! what's all this? I should not give way to
    such things. It is healthier to continue calmly thinking about
    my work and getting better, and to go on quietly day by
    day.</p>

    <p><i>There is love between her and me, and there are promises
    of mutual faithfulness between her and me.</i></p>

    <p>This is a thing, Theo, people ought not to meddle with, for
    it is the most sacred thing in life.</p>

    <p>Her wish and mine is that things will not take a dramatic
    turn; we are too full of a new zest for life, too full of a
    yearning for working and toiling not to do everything in our
    power to avoid extremes.</p>

    <p>But if there were many people, particularly yourself, who
    felt the way Tersteeg does about us, things could not last;
    ultimately they could only turn out miserably.</p>

    <p>If all remains quiet, we shall continue our struggle here by
    working, and though this may seem humdrum and commonplace, it
    is far from easy; one needs courage and energy to attack things
    vigorously and to persevere. We have got through the whole
    winter, and with God's help we shall be able to carry on for a
    bit. I say with God's help, because I am grateful to God, as
    well as to you, for the help I have received, and am still
    receiving, from you.</p>

    <p>Tersteeg is an energetic man, but I hope he will not use his
    energy to persecute Sien and me or anything of the kind.
    Perhaps he will see for himself that he is not obliged to
    interfere and will keep quietly out of things. After all, he
    has no great liking for me, and as a matter of fact, he doesn't
    care one way or another, but he does it because he thinks that
    it will please Uncle Cent or Father and that he is rendering
    them a service.</p>

    <p>He does not consider or spare my interests, my feelings, in
    the least. He comes into my house, he looks at the woman - who
    has her baby at her breast - with an expression in his eyes
    that makes her crumble, and without one kind word to her (a
    thing one does involuntarily to a young mother, even if one
    does not know her), says to me, &ldquo;Is this your model or is
    she something else?&rdquo; Look here, that is neither humane
    nor delicate.</p>

    <p>I myself am not always polite to men, but in any case I
    should make allowances for a weak little woman. He says nothing
    about my drawings, about my studio, etc., but so much the more
    about my uncle at Prinsenhage, in whom I am not the least bit
    interested and with whom I have had no intercourse. And about
    Father - taking it for granted a priori that I am on bad terms
    with him, whereas things have been improving for quite a long
    time.</p>

    <p>Enough of this - but, my dear fellow, write soon, for I
    assure you, a kind letter from you does me more good than my
    pills, etc.</p>

    <p><label content="health.psychological">As for my constitution - Tersteeg is not my physician and he
    does not understand my constitution in the least - when I want
    information on the subject, I shall go to my own doctor and ask
    for it, but I absolutely refuse to discuss it with him any
    more. But it is certain that there are few things more harmful
    either to the woman or to myself than visits like that one we
    just went through. Avoiding these is absolutely one of the
    first medical orders I shall have to carry out. <i>Never</i>
    has a doctor told me that there was something abnormal about me
    in the way and sense Tersteeg dared to tell me this morning.
    That I was not able to think or that my mind was deranged. No
    doctor has told me this, neither in the past nor in the
    present; certainly I have a nervous constitution, but there is
    definitely no real harm in that. So those were serious insults
    on Tersteeg's part, just as they were on Pa's, but even worse,
    when he wanted to send me to Gheel. I cannot take such things
    lying down. I am looking forward to discussing my indisposition
    further with you, what caused it, etc.</label> If in his haste Tersteeg
    should blindly push on, he might cause a lot of mischief, of
    this I am certain.</p>

    <p>I repeat, I have no pretension to keeping up any social
    standing or to living easily; all the expenses needed for the
    woman are only what is necessary for her, and they must be met,
    <i>not by receiving more but by our economizing</i>. That
    economizing is no obstacle for us but a pleasure because of the
    love between us. The feeling of recovery thrills her, as I am
    thrilled by the urge to work again and to become absorbed in
    it. She is a very sweet little mother, so simple, so touching -
    if one only knows her. But there was an ugly expression of
    pain, or I do not know what, on her face when she heard
    Tersteeg talk to me and caught a few words. It may be that
    Tersteeg acted that way because he was taken by surprise - but
    I cannot think it right of him or quite excuse it.</p>

    <p>Well, adieu, boy - I must tell you that when she is calm,
    Sien becomes at once a little mother, so quiet, so delicate, so
    touching, just like an etching or drawing or painting by
    Feyen-Perrin. I am longing to draw again with her posing for
    me. I long for her complete recovery and for mine, for peace
    and quiet, and especially for some sympathy from you. Sien
    sends you her regards, a handshake in thought and believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
