  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today I received a letter from home, and though Father does
    not mention you in it, I want to speak to you about it because
    just now you would perhaps like to know something more about
    their frame of mind than what they write to you directly. And
    it is my impression that for the present you need not worry
    about it.</p>

    <p>The said letter is Father's first since his visit here, and
    it is very kind and cordial, and was accompanied by a parcel
    containing a woman's coat, a hat, a packet of cigars, a cake, a
    money order. In the letter was a draft of a sermon, of which I
    liked the text by far the best, and which touched me less than
    a simple word about a funeral from a farmhand did
    afterward.</p>

    <p>I tell you this in such detail so that you may see there is
    nothing abnormal or any definite overexcitement; but I did get
    the impression that Father was in a rather passive or
    submissive mood, more inclined toward a friendly, melancholy
    view of things than might be supposed from the expressions of
    disapproval you passed on to me.</p>

    <p>I suppose those words were intended more as advice or
    warning - but not as a sign of direct opposition to your firm
    decision.</p>

    <p>Because in my previous letter I disapproved so strongly of
    what Father had said - and I still disapprove of it, as I am
    most decidedly of the opposite opinion, and consider it
    irrelevant to raise difficulties and financial and religious
    objections in this case - I should like to soften my words to
    this extent that I think we are concerned with an error (at
    least number one is an error) [i.e. the financial objections]
    which exists more in his words than in his heart or his frame
    of mind. And I cannot help reminding you that Father is an old
    man, and so fondly attached to you, and I am sure you will find
    that he will give in to you if it must be so, even though it be
    contrary to his own opinion, but that it would be impossible
    for him to live estranged from you or on less friendly terms.
    Well, I suppose I know Father somewhat, and I think I notice
    signs of a little melancholy.</p>

    <p>And looking at it from a human point of view I withdraw my
    opinion that &ldquo;by talking the way they did they have shown
    themselves unworthy of your confidence, and therefore I think
    you need not consult them any longer&rdquo; or something of the
    kind, for I do not remember exactly what I wrote. But please
    understand what I mean not because I disapprove less of what
    they said, but because I have the impression that in this case
    you need not resent it so much, and that there is no urgent
    need to start hostilities as long as they confine themselves to
    words. Better forestall unpleasantness by saying, for instance:
    &ldquo;You take rather a somber view of the future,&rdquo; or,
    &ldquo;But you cannot demand of me that I act as if the clock
    were going to strike the hour of the world's end,&rdquo; which
    I think would be more sensible than attaching too much weight
    to their words.</p>

    <p>I have the impression Father is somewhat melancholy, and
    that perhaps he is worrying over you, and imagining gloomy
    things - but I repeat, Father did not write one syllable about
    the matter itself, and did not say a word about it on the
    occasion of his visit, though this avoidance of mentioning it
    is somewhat abnormal too.</p>

    <p>If you want to remedy this, write somewhat cheerfully and
    lightly, and write about your visit this summer as if it were
    certain that you would see them soon (even if you do not know
    yourself how you can fix the time of your coming).</p>

    <p>For perhaps, perhaps Father himself is conscious of having
    gone a little too far, or perhaps he is anxious about how you
    will take it, and is afraid you will not come.</p>

    <p>Of course I do not know it for sure and can only guess; but
    what I think is, Father is an old man and deserves to be
    cheered up if possible.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">That it is my opinion that you ought to be faithful to the
    woman, you know well enough; there is no question of saying
    anything less about it than I did; you must act as you think
    right, but don't be angry with Father if he is mistaken.</p>

    <p>That is what I wanted to say. Don't even mention that he is
    mistaken unless he continues to press the point; perhaps he
    will change his mind of his own accord.</label></p>

    <p>Now again about the work: today I asked permission to make
    sketches in the old people's asylum, that is, of the men's
    ward, of the women's ward and of the garden.</p>

    <p>I was there today. From the window I sketched an old
    gardener near a twisted apple tree, and the carpenter's shop of
    the asylum, where I had tea with two old almshouse men. In the
    men's ward I can come as a visitor: it was very striking,
    indescribably striking.</p>

    <p>One little fellow, for instance, with a long thin neck, in a
    wheel chair, was splendid. That carpenter's shop with those two
    old men and a view of the cool green garden was just the thing,
    like Bingham's photograph of that little picture by Meissonier,
    those two priests sitting at the table drinking. Perhaps you
    know what I mean.</p>

    <p>But it is not quite certain that I shall get the permission,
    and the application must be made to the deacon in charge. I
    have done so, and must come back for the answer.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, I am making sketches for the drawing of the
    refuse dump. I wrote you, I hoped to get a Scheveningen cape;
    well, I have got it, and an old bonnet into the bargain; the
    latter is not very good, but the cape is superb, and I set to
    work on it at once. I am just as delighted with it as I was
    with the sou'wester before.</p>

    <p>And the sketch of the refuse dump is so far advanced that I
    have caught the sheepfold-like effect of the interior in
    contrast with the open air and the light under the gloomy
    sheds: and a group of women emptying their dustbins is
    beginning to develop and take shape. But, the moving back and
    forth of the wheel-barrows, and the dustmen with the dung
    forks, that rummaging under the sheds, must still be expressed
    without losing the effect of light and brown of the whole: on
    the contrary, it must be strengthened by it.</p>

    <p>I suppose you will take Father's words in the same way of
    your own accord, so that I'm not telling you anything new, but
    I should be glad if, with a little good will, peace might be
    preserved. Last winter Father was nearly as much opposed to my
    living with the woman as he is in your case now, yet he sent me
    a warm woman's coat &ldquo;I might have some use for,&rdquo;
    not precisely indicating for what, but obviously with the
    thought, &ldquo;Perhaps she is suffering from the cold.&rdquo;
    Well, you see that is the right thing, and for <i>one</i> such
    deed I would endure a whole shower of words with pleasure.</p>

    <p>For neither do I myself belong among those people who always
    use the right words - such people would be perfect - and I
    haven't the slightest pretension to perfection.</p>

    <p>But what I wanted to point out to you is this: At all events
    Father certainly objects to my living with the woman <i>much
    more</i> than in your case, and notwithstanding that, last
    winter he thought, &ldquo;Confound the woman but she must not
    freeze.&rdquo; And perhaps in your case, &ldquo;That poor
    Catholic girl must not be forsaken,&rdquo; or something like
    that; so don't worry, keep good courage and try to reassure
    them. Adieu, lad, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
