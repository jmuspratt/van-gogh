    <p>Arles, c.9<sup>th</sup>. July 1888</p>

    <p>My Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have come back from a day at Mont Majour, and my friend the
    sub-lieutenant kept me company. The two of us explored the old garden
    and stole excellent figs there. If it had been bigger
    it would have made me think of Zola's Paradou, great reeds,
    vines, ivy, fig trees, olive trees, pomegranates with lusty flowers
    of the brightest orange, hundred-year-old cypresses, ash trees
    and willows, rock oaks, half-demolished flights of steps, ogive
    windows in ruins, blocks of white rock covered with lichen, and
    scattered fragments of collapsed walls here and there among the
    greenery. I brought back another big drawing, but not of the
    garden. That makes three drawings. When I have half a dozen of them I
    will send them.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I went to Fontvieilles to pay a visit to Bock and Mac Knight,
    only these gentlemen had gone on a little trip to Switzerland
    for 8 days.</p>

    <p>I think the heat is still doing me good, in spite of the
    mosquitoes and flies.</p>

    <p>The grasshoppers &mdash; not like those at home, but like this,
    like those you see in Japanese albums;</p>

    <p><?showImage("619_V-T_5060");?>
    </p>

    <p>and gold and green Cantharides in swarms on the olive trees.
    These grasshoppers (I think they are called cicada) sing at least as loud
    as a frog.</p>

    <p><label content="business.sales">I have again been thinking that when you remember that I
    painted <art id=0363>the portrait of p&egrave;re Tanguy</art>, and that he also had the
    portrait of mother Tanguy (which they sold), and of their
    friend (it is true that for this latter portrait I was paid 20
    francs by him),</label> and that I have bought without discount 250
    francs worth of paints from Tanguy, on which naturally he made
    something, and finally that I have been his friend no less than
    he has been mine, I have very serious reason to doubt his right
    to claim money from me; and it really is squared by the study
    he still has of mine, all the more so because there was an
    express arrangement that he should pay himself by the sale of a
    picture.</p>

    <p>Xanthippe, Mother Tanguy, and some other ladies have by
    some queer freak of Nature heads of silex or flint. Certainly
    these ladies are a good deal more dangerous in civilized
    society they circulate in than the poor citizens bitten by mad dogs
    who live in the Pasteur Institute. And old Tanguy would be
    right a thousand times over to kill his lady&hellip;but he won't
    do it, any more than Socrates.</p>

    <p>And for this reason old Tanguy has more in common &mdash; in
    resignation and long suffering anyhow &mdash; with the ancient
    Christian martyrs and slaves, than with the present day pimps
    of Paris.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, there is no reason to pay him 80
    francs, but it is a reason for never losing your temper with
    him, even if he loses his, when, as you may do in this
    instance, you chuck him out, or at least send him packing.</p>

    <p>I am writing to Russell at the same time. I think we know,
    don't we, that the English, the Yankees, have this much in
    common with the Dutch, that their charity&hellip;is very
    Christian. Now, the rest of us not being very good
    Christians&hellip;That's what I can't put out of my head
    writing again like this.</p>

    <p>This Bock has a head rather like a Flemish gentleman of the
    time of the Compromise of the Nobles, of the time of Taciturn [William the Silent]
    and Marnix. I shouldn't wonder if he's a decent fellow.</p>

    <p>I have written to Russell that I would send him my parcel in
    a roll direct to him, for our exchange, if I knew that he was
    in Paris.</p>

    <p>That means he must in any case answer me soon. Now I shall
    soon need some more canvas and paints. But I have not yet got
    the address of that canvas at 40 francs for 20 meters.</p>

    <p>I think it is well to work especially at drawing just now,
    and to arrange to have paints and canvas in reserve for when
    Gauguin comes. I wish paint was as little of a worry to work
    with as pen and paper. I often pass up a painted study for fear
    of wasting the colour.</p>

    <p>With paper, whether it's a letter I'm writing or a drawing
    I'm working on, there's never a misfire &mdash; so many leaves
    of Whatman, so many drawings. I think that if I were rich I
    should spend less than I do now.</p>

    <p>Well, old Martin would say, then it's up to you to get rich,
    and he is right, as he is about the masterpiece.</p>

    <p>Do you remember reading in Guy de Maupassant the gentleman
    hunter of rabbits and other game, and who had hunted so hard for
    ten years, and was so exhausted by running after the game that
    when he wanted to get married he found he was impotent, which
    caused him the greatest embarrassment and consternation.</p>

    <p><label content="health.impotence">Without being in the same state as this gentleman as to its
    being either my duty or my desire to get married, I begin to
    resemble him in physique. According to the worthy master Ziem, man
    becomes ambitious once he becomes impotent. Now though
    it's pretty much all one to me whether I am impotent or not,
    I'm damned if that's going to drive me to ambition.</label></p>

    <p>It is only the greatest philosopher of his place and time, and
    consequently of all places and all times, good old master
    Pangloss who could &mdash; if he were here &mdash; give me
    advice and calm my soul.</p>

    <p>There &mdash; the letter to Russell is in its envelope, and
    I have written as I intended. I asked him if he had any news of
    Reid, and I ask you the same question.</p>

    <p>I told Russell I left him free to take what he liked, and
    from the first consignment I sent as well. And that I was only waiting
    for his explicit answer, to know whether he preferred to make
    his choice at his or your place; that if, in the former
    circumstance, he wanted to see them at his own house, you would
    send him along some orchards as well, and fetch the lot back
    again when he had made his choice. So he cannot quarrel with
    that. If he takes nothing from Gauguin it is because he cannot.
    If he can, I am hoping that he will. </p>

    <p>I told him that if I ventured to press him to buy, it was not because
    nobody else would if he didn't, but because Gauguin, having
    been ill, and with the further complication of his having been
    laid up in bed and having to pay his doctor, it all fell rather
    heavily on us; and we were all the more anxious to find a
    purchaser for a painting.</p>

    <p>I am thinking a lot about Gauguin, and I would have plenty
    of ideas for pictures, and about work in general.I have a charwoman
    now for 1 franc, who sweeps and scrubs
    the house for me twice a week. I am banking very much on her,
    counting on her to make our beds if we decide to sleep in
    the house. Otherwise we could make some arrangement with the
    fellow where I am staying now. Anyhow, we'll try to manage so
    that it would work out as an economy instead of more expense.
    How is your health now? Are you still going to Gruby?</p>

    <p>What you tell me of that conversation at the Nouvelle Ath&egrave;nes is
    interesting. You know the little portrait by Desboutin that
    Portier has very well.</p>

    <p>It certainly is a strange phenomenon that all the artists,
    poets, musicians, painters, are unfortunate in material things
    &mdash; the happy ones as well &mdash; what you said lately
    about Guy de Maupassant is a fresh proof of it. That brings up
    again the eternal question: is life completely visible to us,
    or isn't it rather that this side of death we see one
    hemisphere only?</p>

    <p>Painters &mdash; to take them only &mdash; being dead and buried,
    speak to the next generation or to several succeeding
    generations through their work.</p>

    <p>Is that all, or is there more besides? In a painter's life
    death is not perhaps the hardest thing there is.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.death">For my own part, I declare I know nothing whatever about it.
    But to look at the stars always makes me dream, as simply as I
    dream over the black dots of a map representing towns and
    villages. Why, I ask myself, should the shining dots of the sky
    not be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? If
    we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to
    reach a star. One thing undoubtedly true in this reasoning is
    this: that while we are alive we cannot get to a star, any more
    than when we are dead we can take the train.</p>

    <p>So it doesn't seem impossible to me that cholera, gravel, pleurisy
    &amp; cancer are the means of celestial locomotion, just as
    steam-boats, omnibuses and railways are the terrestrial means.
    To die quietly of old age would be to go there on foot.</label></p>

    <p>Now I am going to bed, because it is late, and I wish you
    good night and good luck.</p>

    <p>A handshake, Yours</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
