    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I really want to know if you are leaving The Hague. Is that
    what you want, too? Do write me if it is <i>yes</i> or
    <i>no</i>? Provisionally I am staying here, and I probably will
    not go to Holland before the autumn.</p>

    <p>In the first box that goes to The Hague you will find a
    little parcel for Helvoirt. Please forward it after looking at
    what's in it. There are a few lithographs which I should like
    to see hanging in Father's study, next to the &ldquo;Funeral
    Procession through the Cornfields,&rdquo; by Van der Maaten.
    &ldquo;An Old Huguenot,&rdquo; by Anker - the lithograph of
    which is in the parcel - I have sold to Uncle Vincent, who was
    here a few days ago. He also bought a beautiful picture by
    Jacque, &ldquo;Horses before a Plough in the Rain.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I don't know whether I have already written to you about it
    or not, but there has been a sale here of drawings by Millet.
    When I entered the hall of the H&ocirc;tel Drouot, where they
    were exhibited, I felt like saying, &ldquo;Take off your shoes,
    for the place where you are standing is Holy Ground.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>You know that Millet lived at Gr&eacute;ville. Well, I do
    not know whether it was at Gr&eacute;ville or Granville that
    the man whom I told you of died. However this may be, I looked
    at Millet's drawings of &ldquo;The Rocks of
    Gr&eacute;ville&rdquo; with extra care. There is now a picture
    of his at the Luxembourg, &ldquo;The Church at
    Gr&eacute;ville.&rdquo; &Agrave; Dieu</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
