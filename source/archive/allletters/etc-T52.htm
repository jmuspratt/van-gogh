    <p>[From Hermann Schlittgen (1859 - ?), Erinnerungen
    (Reminiscences), Munich, Albert Langen, 1926.]</p>

    <p>The new art began to interest me; I saw the first
    impressionists. One day, as we were walking along the great
    boulevards, suddenly we stood transfixed. There on the other
    side of the road, in the show window of the art-dealing
    establishment of Goupil's, was displayed a picture which sent
    its radiance through all the bustle and hurry of the broad
    boulevard. We crossed the road and saw our first Claude Monet,
    a seascape with a brightly coloured boat in the
    foreground&hellip;</p>

    <p>Upstairs, on the first floor, was displayed a collection of
    pictures by Monet; we simply could not tear ourselves away.
    This was a great impression, on of the strongest I have
    received in all my life.</p>

    <p>After this we came back again and again; an obliging young
    employee with reddish hair, who did not look at all like a
    Frenchman, would hail us with pleasure like good acquaintances.
    It was easy to see that the public was not very interested in
    this style of art; most of the time the establishment was empty
    of visitors.</p>

    <p>We looked in rapture; the young man stood apart, smiled and
    was visibly delighted. After a few days he accosted us; he had
    seen that we were so very interested in modern art; he had a
    brother who was a painter and who was living in the country;
    would we allow him to show us some pictures of his?</p>

    <p>From an adjoining room he brought some unframed pictures of
    a smaller size. He remained standing modestly by our side,
    observing the effect this art produced on us. We had just come
    from Monet, and here we felt a certain constraint; this was
    something quite different, nature viewed by a willful
    temperament, decorative, in many cases the outlines marked in
    blue paint, as in old Japanese woodcuts. The gentleman asked me
    for my opinion; I praised the beautiful clear colours, but in
    my opinion some things were too stylized. The courteous
    gentleman thanked me, and carried the pictures back. Often when
    we passed the shop he was standing behind the street door
    looking through the glass at the boulevard, and he would greet
    us with a kind smile.</p>

    <p>Only much later did we discover that this was Theo van
    Gogh.</p>
