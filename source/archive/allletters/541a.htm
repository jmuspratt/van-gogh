  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have to thank you most kindly for the consignment of
    canvas and colours from Tasset's, which arrived in good
    condition and this time by parcel post. In my last letter I
    already told you that autumn has manifested itself in rain and
    bad weather. This has hampered me a little, but all the same I
    have just finished <art id=0574>a size 30 canvas representing a ploughed
    field, done in the sunny intervals.</art></p>

    <p>[<art id=666_V-T_541a0>A sketch of "Ploughed Fields (The Furrows)" appeared here.</art>]</p>

    <p>A blue sky with white clouds. An immense expanse of ground
    of an ashy lilac. Innumerable furrows and clods. A horizon of
    blue hills and green bushes with - [illegible].</p>

    <p>This is another one that will take a long time to dry;
    pictures that are thickly painted must be treated like the
    stronger types of wine; one must let them mature. I have
    ordered a white deal frame for this one.</p>

    <p>As long s autumn lasts, I shall not have hands, canvas and
    colours enough to paint the beautiful things I see.</p>

    <p>I am also working on <art id=0473>a portrait of Milliet</art>,
    but he poses badly, or I may be at fault myself, which,
    however, I do not believe, as I am sorely in want of some
    studies of him, for he is a good-looking boy, very unconcerned
    and easy-going in his behaviour, and he would suit me damned
    well for the picture of a lover.</p>

    <p>I have already promised him a study for his trouble, but,
    you know, he cannot keep still.</p>

    <p>Besides, he hardly has any time to spare, seeing that he
    must take a tender leave of all the grues et grenouilles de la
    grenouill&egrave;re <sup>1</sup> of Arles, now that he has to
    return to his f&mdash; garrison, as he says.</p>

    <p>I do not object to it, but I regret that he has a nervous
    motion of the legs when posing.</p>

    <p>He is a good fellow, but he is only twenty-five, God damn
    it, ten years younger than I am - and within ten years -
    according to Ziem - I am afraid that, if he goes on like this,
    and not being able to caper about any longer, he may join the
    ambitious.</p>

    <p>I should not be surprised if in his heart he were annoyed at
    having to leave, and perhaps he is living beyond his means,
    which obliges him to go back to Africa. I only know one serious
    fault in his character, which is that he likes L'abb&eacute;
    Constantin by Georges Ohnet, and I have told him that he had a
    thousand times better read Bel Ami by Guy de Maupassant.</p>

    <p>What does Father Tanguy say of the gross-grained paints now?
    <label content="art.supplies">I think I must warn him at once that I still want 5 or even 10
    meters of canvas. And that at the same time I shall also
    want:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    3 large tubes as the silver white and the zinc white and the
    Prussian blue.<br>

    6 large tubes id. id. chrome I citron<br>

    6 &ldquo; &ldquo; id. id. chrome II<br>

    2 &ldquo; &ldquo; id. id. chrome III<br>

    6 &ldquo; &ldquo; id. id. malachite green<br>

    and 6 medium tubes geranium lake<br>

    12 zinc white, large tubes<br>

    12 silver white<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>This is approximately in proportion to the canvas.</p>

    <p>As I have just received the consignment of canvas and
    colours, you will understand that there is no hurry; however,
    it is the minimum that I shall need during autumn and the
    falling of the leaves, which will be marvellous and which lasts
    only one week.</label></p>

    <p>I am sure that I shall be able to do a good job of work, and
    during that period I should not like to run short of yellow and
    blue.<label content="art.materials"> In case you should be a bit hard up, I could manage
    perfectly without the expensive blues and the carmine. One tube
    of Prussian blue yields as much as six of ultramarine or cobalt
    and costs <i>three times less</i>.</p>

    <p>Now it fades a little, but when I use zinc white in its
    crude state, I shall be able to do without the rest if
    necessary.</label></p>

    <p>Delacroix swore by that vulgar blue and used it often.</p>

    <p>So I warn you of the state of affairs in advance, though the
    famous falling of the leaves is still a considerable distance
    off.</p>

    <p>I must work like a team of mules as long as autumn lasts if
    I want to recover what our furniture has cost.</p>

    <p>I wanted to do some sunflowers again but they were already
	finished. Yes, during autumn I would like to be able to make a
	dozen 30 square canvases and I can very well accomplish it as
	far as I can see. I have a terrifying lucidity at times when
	nature is so beautiful these days, and then I am not conscious
	of myself any more, and the painting comes to me as in a dream.
	I am rather afraid that it will have a reaction of depression
	when we have rotten weather but then I will seek for a
	distraction in the study of these questions of drawing figures
	from memory.</p>

	    <p>I am always frustrated in my best powers by the lack of
	    models, but I don't let it worry me - I do a landscape and
	    colour without worrying about where it will take me. I know
	    this, that if I were to beg the models &ldquo;Now pose for me I
	    beg you,&rdquo; I would be behaving like Zola's good painter in
	    his book. And certainly Manet, for example, didn't behave like
	    that. And in his book Zola doesn't say how those that didn't
	    see anything supernatural in painting acted.</p>

	    <p>But don't criticise Zola's book. I will send five of
	    Bernard's drawings in the style of the others.</p>

	    <p><label content="business.co-op">I wrote to him that since Gauguin had not definitely stated
	    if he would come or would not come I could not offer Bernard
	    the free hospitality, or even paid in pictures or drawings.
	    That here just his food alone would cost him in any case a bit
	    more that food and lodging up where he currently is. A bit less
	    perhaps if we ate in the studio, with or without Gauguin, we
	    could make some savings.</label></p>

	    <p>But that in any case I didn't urge him to come. That as I
	    counted on wintering here, certainly his company would be very
	    welcome, but that above all he must do his calculations
	    well.</p>

	    <p>If one of these days Gauguin writes to you definitely,
	    either to you or to me, we will be able to see again about
	    Bernard. I think myself that Bernard would certainly find his
	    business here but his father should be a little bit more
	    magnanimous in his regard. Because Bernard is painstaking. - I
	    don't like these drawings, however, as much that the previous
	    ones.</p>

	    <p>At the beginning of next month there will again be a heap of
	    things that will fall on my back at the same time. In the
	    frames and stretchers that I am having made here for the
	    decoration of the house at the same time as the month's rent
	    and the cleaning woman.</p>

	    <p>But I can delay taking the frames and the stretchers, and
	    therefore I hope I will get by in any case.</p>

	    <p>The only hope that I have that is that by working very hard,
	    at the end of one year I will have enough paintings to be able
	    to exhibit - if I want or if you want to - at the time of the
	    exhibition. I am not set on it, but what I am certainly set on
	    is showing something not at all bad.</p>

	    <p>I would <i>not</i> exhibit, but we would have in my house
	    work of mine that would prove that I am not slothful, nor an
	    idler. I would be at peace, but the main thing seems to me to
	    be that I must not give myself less trouble that the painters
	    who work expressly for it.</p>

	    <p>Whether one exhibits or one doesn't exhibit it is necessary
	    to be productive, and from then on one has the right to smoke
	    his pipe in peace.</p>

	    <p>But this year we will be productive and I'm endeavouring to
	    make this new series better than the first two
	    consignments.</p>

	    <p>And among the studies there will be some, I hope, that are
	    paintings, so to speak, there.</p>

	    <p>As for the starry sky, I keep hoping very much to paint it,
	    and perhaps I will one of these days, in the same ploughed
	    field if the sky is glittering properly.</p>

	    <p>Tolstoy's book My Religion has already been published in
	    French in 1885 but I have never seen it in any catalogue.</p>

	    <p>He does not appear to believe much in a resurrection of the
	    body or the soul. Above all he barely appears to believe in
	    heaven - he argues these things like a nihilist - but - in
	    opposition to most of these people - he attaches great
	    importance of doing the things that one does well, since that
	    is probably all one has.</p>

	    <p>And if he doesn't believe in resurrection, he appears to
	    believe in the equivalent - the continuance of life - the march
	    of humanity, of man and his work continued almost infallibly by
	    the humanity of the generation to come. After all, they must
	    not be empty consolations that he gives. Himself a nobleman, he
	    made himself a worker, he knows how to make boots, knows how to
	    repair stoves, knows how to guide a plough and to dig the
	    earth.</p>

	    <p>I know nothing at all of all that, but I respect an
	    energetic human soul, noted for his reforms too. My god, all
	    the same we don't have to pity ourselves for living at a time
	    where there are nothing but loafers, when we are contemporaries
	    of similar specimens of poor mortals who don't even believe
	    very strongly in heaven. He believes - maybe I already wrote of
	    it to you, in a non-violent revolution caused by the need for
	    love and religion that, as a reaction to the scepticism and
	    desperate and discouraging suffering, must appear in
	    people.</p>

	    <p>Goodbye. Your last letter came on Friday; if I got the next
	    letter on Friday too it would be awfully good.</p>

	    <p>But it is not pressing, it will be alright whatever happens.
	    A handshake</p>

	    <p>Ever yours,</p>

	    <p>Vincent</p>

	    <p>Editor's note: For many years the end of this letter was thought to be missing.
	    The recent emergence of the sketch of Vincent's house [F 1453] revealed that the final four
	    pages of 543 did not belong there but were in fact the end of this letter. They are now
	    restored to their rightful place for the first time.
