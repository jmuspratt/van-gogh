  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Now it is some days since I started looking through the
    <i>Graphics</i>.</p>

    <p>If I were to write you about all that is beautiful in them,
    and if my description were not to be too superficial, I should
    really have to write a tome. I cannot refrain, however, from
    mentioning just a few sheets that are absolutely &ldquo;<i>hors
    ligne</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Take, for instance, Frank Hol's &ldquo;The Foundling.&rdquo;
    It represents some policemen in their waterproof capes who have
    picked up a baby exposed among the beams and planks of the
    Thames Embankment. Some inquisitive people are looking on, and
    in the background one sees the grey silhouette of the town
    through the mist. Then, also by him, there is a burial - some
    people entering a churchyard - beautiful of sentiment; he calls
    this sheet &ldquo;I am the Resurrection and the
    life.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There is another burial by Nash, but this time on shipboard.
    One sees the corpse near the railing, the sailors are standing
    by, and the captain is reading the liturgy.</p>

    <p>You know Hol's &ldquo;Third Class Waiting Room&rdquo; from a
    small reproduction of it that I sent you last summer, but the
    Graphic contains the large one - infinitely more beautiful.</p>

    <p>I have been interested before now in the work of C. Green,
    but I had no idea that he could do such splendid things as, for
    instance, &ldquo;A Bench in the Hospital,&rdquo; patients
    waiting for the doctor. By the same, &ldquo;A Quay at
    Liverpool&rdquo; and &ldquo;Land once More,&rdquo; passengers
    coming ashore, and &ldquo;Here They Come,&rdquo; spectators at
    the Derby races (Buckmann has done the same scene under the
    same title, and his work is also very good). I did not know
    Gordon Thompson; he also has a &ldquo;Spectators at the Derby,&rdquo; and
    there is &ldquo;Clapham Road&rdquo; - quite close to the spot
    where I used to live, incidentally. This sheet is incredibly
    clever; it resembles D&uuml;rer or Matsys, for instance.</p>

    <p>You know the work of Percy Macquoid - Heilbuth - Tissot -
    when you see it, it seems to be the non plus ultra of elegance
    and mild refined feeling. In a certain sense it really is the
    non plus ultra.</p>

    <p>But compared with them, Pinwell and Fred. Walker are what
    the nightingale is to the lark. On a page of the Graphic called
    &ldquo;The Sisters,&rdquo; for instance, Pinwell draws two
    women in black in a dark room, a composition of the utmost
    simplicity, into which he has brought a serious sentiment that
    I can compare only with the full warble of the nightingale on a
    spring night. And then there are two more sketches by him in
    Byley's Home<i>;</i> and, among other things by Fred. Walker, a
    splendid sheet, &ldquo;The Old Gate,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;The
    Harbor of Refuge.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Herkomer has in them, among other things (I am not speaking
    of the sheets I had already), &ldquo;Divine Service&rdquo;
    (pews in a church), &ldquo;Treat to the Whitechapel
    Poor,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lodginghouse St. Giles,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
    Workhouse (<i>women</i>),&rdquo; &ldquo;Charcoal
    Burners,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wirtshaus&rdquo; [Public House],
    &ldquo;The Cardinals Walk Rome,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kegelbahn,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Carnival Time,&rdquo; &ldquo;Anxious Times,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;The Arrest of a Poacher,&rdquo; Then (without the large
    figures occurring in it) the very first sketch of<art id=erkomer2> &ldquo;The
    Last Muster,&rdquo; under the title, &ldquo;Sunday at
    Chelsea</art>.&rdquo; In a later issue one can read about this sheet
    that, when Herkomer showed it for the first time, <i>not
    one</i> of the members of the Graphic board thought the drawing
    good, with only one exception - the manager, who published the
    sketch immediately and ordered a more elaborate drawing.</p>

    <p>So you see, things may change in the world - for instance,
    later on the Graphic published a sheet representing the
    spectators looking at the ultimate painting of &ldquo;The Last
    Muster.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>You know Ridley's &ldquo;Miner's Head.&rdquo; Now I also
    have his &ldquo;Boat Race Spectators&rdquo;; I already had a
    &ldquo;Hospital&rdquo; by him - both serious, elaborate
    drawings.</p>

    <p>But something new by Ridley is a series of six or seven
    drawings, &ldquo;Miners, Pits and Pitmen,&rdquo; which remind
    one of etchings of Whistler or Seymour Haden, or Stamland's
    [Staniland's] &ldquo;The Rush to the Pit's Mouth,&rdquo; also
    from the mining district.</p>

    <p>Now a sheet that struck me particularly - Abbey's
    &ldquo;Christmas in Old Virginia,&rdquo; engraved by Swain.
    This drawing is evidently done wholly with the pen, like
    Caldecott's and Barnard's, for example, but the figures are
    large.</p>

    <p>Small has a superb drawing, &ldquo;Claxton [Caxton] Showing
    Specimens of His Printing to the King.&rdquo; It makes one
    think of Leys; there are many beautiful things by Small in the
    Graphics<i>,</i> of course, but this one and the
    &ldquo;Ploughing Match&rdquo; are the most beautiful drawings
    of his I know.</p>

    <p>His &ldquo;A Queue in Paris during the Siege&rdquo; is
    excellent, and so are several of his &ldquo;London
    Sketches&rdquo; and &ldquo;Irish Sketches.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then Green has &ldquo;The Girl I Left behind Me,&rdquo; also
    uncommonly good - a group of soldiers returning from the war,
    and the meeting of one of them with the girl who has remained
    faithful to him. &ldquo;Irish Churchyard&rdquo; is no less
    beautiful.</p>

    <p>Boughton's &ldquo;Waning of the Honeymoon.&rdquo; Nash's
    &ldquo;Laborers' Meeting&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lifeboat&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;Sunday Evening at Sea.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Gregory's &ldquo;Hospital in Paris during the Siege.&rdquo;
    Buckmann's &ldquo;Hampstead Heath.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Fildes has a scene in a prison yard where policemen are
    holding a thief or a murderer whose picture they want to take.
    The fellow won't submit to it and is struggling. In the
    opposite corner of the composition, the photographer and the
    spectators.</p>

    <p>There are many more beautiful compositions from America by
    Boyd Houghton, chiefly smaller ones, which might be etchings,
    but also larger sheets such as &ldquo;Paris under the Red
    Flag,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mormon Tabernacle,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cabin of
    Emigrant Ship&rdquo; - they're not like anything else. His
    details are emphasized surprisingly, and the aspect is
    something like an etching by - yes, by whom? - by Fortuny, or
    perhaps Whistler? Highly curious.</p>

    <p>Edwin Edward's &ldquo;The Foundling,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sea
    Bathing,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Meet,&rdquo; etc. Two drawings - I
    don't know whose - of the Turko-Russian War, &ldquo;Osman
    Pasha&rdquo; and &ldquo;An Old Battleground,&rdquo; which are
    remarkable in their realism.</p>

    <p>Stock's &ldquo;Sermon Time&rdquo; and &ldquo;Last
    Sacrament.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Hodgson's &ldquo;Navvies&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;Fishing.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Gow's &ldquo;No Surrender.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><i>Small's</i> &ldquo;Swan-Upping Game of Polo,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Boat Race,&rdquo; &ldquo;Queen's Ladies Royal
    Academy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Walking Match.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Green's &ldquo;An Artist,&rdquo; &ldquo;One Stone,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Outsiders Betting.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, in this matter it's easy to start summing up, but to
    stop is something else - that is difficult; there is so much
    more, in fact there is no end of them. For I am speaking almost
    exclusively of the larger sheets; but, to mention a single
    example, among the small drawings there are illustrations of
    Victor Hugo's Quatre-vingt-treize [Ninety-Three] by Herkomer,
    Green, Small - seldom has a book been illustrated like this
    one! - fortunately it is <i>this</i> book, for it is fully
    worth it.</p>

    <p>But there is one volume missing from the collection, namely
    the first one. But I got very nice drawings from this volume at
    one time - among other things, Fildes's &ldquo;Applicants at a
    Casual Ward&rdquo; (from &ldquo;Home and the Homeless&rdquo;)
    and his <art id=mptychair>&ldquo;The Empty Chair&rdquo; (Dickens's studio)</art>.</p>

    <p>Write me again soon - for you are recovered now, aren't
    you?</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I got two more volumes (1876) for good measure this week,
    but I took them anyway, because there are marvelous things in
    them; indeed I have them, but I want as many duplicates as I
    can find - e.g. Herkomer's &ldquo;Old Women&rdquo; - there's a
    masterpiece for you! Have you got it???</p>

    <p>A beautiful &ldquo;Woman's Figure&rdquo; and &ldquo;During
    the Reign of Terror&rdquo; by Percy Macquoid; also little
    sketches: &ldquo;Cats&rdquo; - &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; -
    &ldquo;Mackerel Fishing.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Finally a large drawing: a corner of a studio - a lay figure
    that has fallen over, draperies worried by two playful dogs.
    There is preciosity in it, but it does not quite satisfy me; I
    think it somewhat high falutin' and over-refined. There is
    another magnificent illustration by Fildes (for a novel): two
    men in a churchyard in the twilight.</p>

    <p>You will understand why I am of two minds about the
    following question. If I cut out the sheets and mount them,
    they will show up better and I can arrange them according to
    the artists who did them. But then I mutilate the text, which
    is useful in many respects if one wants to look something up,
    for instance about exhibitions, although the &ldquo;general
    surveys&rdquo; of them are very superficial.</p>

    <p>And besides, one damages the novels, as e.g<i>.</i>
    Quatre-vingt-treize by Hugo.</p>

    <p>I'd also have to spend a lot on mounting board. But it is
    certain that the large sheets especially would show up
    infinitely better mounted than folded in half. And also one
    gets a better survey of the whole if one arranges them
    according to the artists.</p>

    <p>But isn't it queer that in an artistic town like The Hague a
    man like me should be the <i>highest</i> bidder at a book
    auction? One would think that other buyers would turn up - but
    no! I really did not expect to get them.</p>

    <p>Before the auction the Jew spoke to me about them; I told
    him that I should very much like to have them, but that I could
    not afford to buy something like that. He told me afterward
    that he had bought them on speculation, because there were
    hardly any bidders, and if I wanted to have them they were
    mine. That was quite a different matter, and my brother helped
    me buy them - dirt cheap - a guilder a volume.</p>

    <p>However glad I am to have them, it makes me sad to think
    that so few take an interest in them. I think it's wonderful to
    find such a treasure, but I would rather see so lively an
    interest in them that I should not be able to get hold of them
    for the time being.</p>

    <p>Oh, Rappard - in many respect it's like this - much that has
    great value nowadays is ignored and looked down upon as
    worthless rubbish, garbage, wastepaper.</p>

    <p>Don't you think there is something very dull about our
    times? Or am I imagining it? A certain absence of passion and
    warmth and cordiality - it's true that the
    &ldquo;dealers&rdquo; and such fellows say, &ldquo;The desired
    change will come about in the nature of things&rdquo; (isn't
    this statement highly satisfactory?), but personally I don't
    see that &ldquo;nature of things&rdquo; so very clearly.</p>

    <p>It isn't unpleasant, after all, to study the
    Graphics<i>;</i> yet I can't help thinking very selfishly while
    doing so, &ldquo;What business is it of mine? I don't intend to
    be bored, even if the times are dull.&rdquo; But one isn't
    always selfish, and as soon as one isn't, one may grieve
    bitterly over it.</p>
