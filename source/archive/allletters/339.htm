  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>After having written about it, I have thought it over out on
    the heath. The same thing I had thought over so often already.
    Among the old masters as well as among the modern ones, one
    often meets with the same instance of two brothers being
    painters, in whose work there is more resemblance than
    difference. They are quite different, yet they complement each
    other perfectly. Take, for instance, the Ostades, Adriaan and
    Isaac. Well, you know yourself many other cases. The Van Eycks
    too.</p>

    <p>And in our time, Jules and &Eacute;mile Breton, to name only
    a few. And already I have so often thought how delightful it
    must be to work together, and how productive the two can be
    together, just because one encourages the other, and saves the
    other so many periods of melancholy.</p>

    <p>I cannot repeat to you often enough, boy, that when one is
    thirty, one is just <i>beginning</i>. Look at the biographies
    of artists, even many who had painted from their earliest years
    changed only then, found their own personality only then. I
    only ask you to take those things into consideration. I know
    one is faced with the problem &ldquo;bread.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The argument, I must eat, I must live somewhere, is not
    wrong; on the contrary, I think it absolutely correct.</p>

    <p>Very well, but to everybody who says, &ldquo;I haven't the
    means,&rdquo; I put one question; that question is:
    &ldquo;Friend, what are your claims, how high is your standard?
    Is your character such that you think, for instance, like
    Corot, who didn't mind buying a loaf at the baker's and eating
    it in the fields when he couldn't pay for a dinner? In short,
    can you be contented with little and not care in the least for
    the conventions of life?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>You are exactly that way basically, and would put up with
    many things. And though the &ldquo;bread&rdquo; problem may not
    be quite settled then, it will be cleared up a great deal. When
    I think of the possibility of your coming here sooner or later,
    and I begin to calculate, I arrived at the conclusion that
    together we shall need little more or no more than I alone.</p>

    <p>And besides, I firmly believe that your presence would be a
    stimulus to me in so many things, that it would be such a help
    to me to talk and discuss things and exchange views with you
    that I should be able to work better.</p>

    <p>Now hardly a day passes that I do not make something. As
    practice makes perfect, I cannot but make progress; each
    drawing one makes, each study one paints, is a step forward.
    It's true, it is the same as on a road, one sees the church
    spire in the distance, but as the ground undulates, when one
    thinks one has arrived, there is another bit one had not seen
    at first, and which must still be covered. But one gets nearer
    and nearer. After a longer or shorter time, I do not know how
    long, I shall arrive at the point of beginning to sell.</p>

    <p>All right, once I am so far, it won't be by halves, for I
    don't work by halves. And I try my hand at different things
    simultaneously, therefore I shall have more than one string to
    my bow, more than one arrow; that is what I, for my part, can
    throw into the Gulf called &ldquo;bread.&rdquo; Things may
    change for me, and though I do not sell now, notwithstanding
    all my drudging - I repeat: things may change.</p>

    <p>We should need, let us say, at least 150 francs a month as a
    minimum, preferably 200 francs, we should have to find credit
    for that, not without a guarantee, but our work would be that
    guarantee. Now, let us suppose we should have to work for two
    years before we begin to earn well, more than we spend, so that
    we can pay off our debts.</p>

    <p>200 francs a month in two years is 2400 francs. Well, let's
    put it at 1500 guilders.</p>

    <p>This may serve as a guarantee - I am now thinking of you and
    me working together, that we ourselves have invested a great
    deal already, and have laid a certain foundation. My skill is
    my own, some things of drawing, even some things of painting,
    are firmly rooted and were not acquired by pure chance, but by
    honest work. I call this another guarantee that we do not build
    castles in the air.</p>

    <p>Look here, Theo, I shouldn't be able to talk with you if you
    didn't possess a certain self-confidence, a certain
    self-knowledge. I have told you before that I think you are an
    artist at heart, and I am more and more strengthened in that
    opinion. You will say, I cannot make anything - no, of course
    not <i>now</i>, but after a year's work, when the first
    difficulties have somewhat cleared up, you will feel with the
    greatest serenity that, yes, perhaps not everybody can become a
    painter by sheer drudging when he lacks a certain
    predisposition to it - but in yourself you would perceive that
    disposition to mediate, to think and analyze, to <i>feel</i>
    the beauty in nature, and discover that you can be an artist
    for the very reason that you possess both diligence and energy,
    which now, however, are working in another direction, so that
    nothing is left for art. But if that same diligence became the
    motive power of your sense of beauty, the result would be a
    true painter.</p>

    <p>I must come back for a moment to that question of
    &ldquo;bread.&rdquo; A great many things which are said to be
    impossible are possible after all.</p>

    <p>Permit me to suppose for a moment that you had arrived at a
    point where you had to make a change - the time hasn't come
    yet, I'm only supposing it for the moment - then you will get a
    situation in some other concern; all right, but what ought to
    be bright is not the near future, but the deeper background,
    the horizon. And to me this background seems to be mighty dark.
    Now if you become a painter, look at the more distant future,
    the deeper background - there is no darkness in it - it is only
    in front of you, in the immediate foreground.</p>

    <p>Your personal energy may turn you into a painter, and others
    will not be able to prevent it, but it might well be that this
    &ldquo;personal energy&rdquo; in the art-dealing business would
    not be exactly the commodity which certain employers, new ones
    included, would desire, particularly at moments when they are
    in a scrape.</p>

    <p>For all of your personal energy, you might find yourself in
    the same straits as Wisselingh did, who most certainly is
    energetic, and who was with Goupil too.</p>

    <p>I said, many things which are said to be impossible are
    possible after all. If circumstances made it unavoidable, why
    shouldn't we go and live with Father? I do not say for nothing,
    but in case we should not earn enough to stick it out here in
    Drenthe. We might get credit. But never mind that, and take the
    first possibility. It would be hard work, but by the pleasure
    of being together, by living together in that unutterably
    beautiful scenery, and especially the consciousness of being
    two craftsman, boy, how delightful it would be. So delightful
    that I hardly dare to think of it, yet cannot help doing so,
    though that happiness seems too great, for you as well as for
    myself, because we are not used to getting pleasure out of
    life, and feel that is rather more for others than for us.</p>

    <p>We should need credit to the amount of 1500 guilders. I do
    not know where and how to get it. I will work out for you how
    we should use the money. We should make an arrangement for two
    years with my landlord here, perhaps pay a part in advance. I
    think that for 1000 guilders he would give us both board and
    lodging during those years, would let us have this room where I
    am living now - in short, we should be free from all domestic
    cares during those two years, and should be able to work
    steadily and quietly.</p>

    <p>Two years are a pretty long time, are all that you would
    need under the circumstances to reach a certain height.</p>

    <p>Then we shall have some money left to lay up a big stock of
    colours, to supply ourselves well.</p>

    <p>Then there will be few things which can upset us or make us
    change our plans. We will be in for it then, and must go on. We
    will have insured our lives as to board and lodging, and will
    not be able to go back, but must, must, must go forward and
    win.</p>

    <p>As to you, I think you must act differently than I did.
    That's past now. Up to the present I have acted as I thought
    best, but as for you, I wish you would start painting at once,
    <i>I know exactly what you would like to make here</i>.</p>

    <p>I should like you to try your hand at landscape at once, in
    the spirit of <i>Michel</i>, which I see here all the time. It
    is absolutely Michel, <i>that's</i> what it is here. I feel
    sure that I can show you the way in this, because just now I
    tried things of the same kind; I do not pretend they are as
    good as Michel, but I daresay that when you are as far advanced
    as that, you will be able to find your own way.</p>

    <p>As for me, <i>especially if you were here</i>, I should
    concentrate more and more on the figure.</p>

    <p>I will just make a scratch of the <art id=022>landscapes</art> which I have on
    the easel.</p>

    <p><?showImage("395_V-T_3390");?>
     These are the kinds of studies which I should like you to try
    it once: to learn to look at the landscape in a big way, and
    seek its simple lines and contrasts of light and brown. The
    little sketch at the top is what I saw today, it was absolutely
    Michel. In reality that earth was superb. I don't think my
    study ripe enough yet, but I was struck by the effect, and as
    to light and shade, it was indeed as I draw it for you
    here.</p>

    <p>The one at the bottom is a tender green little cornfield in
    the foreground, and withering grasses; behind the cottage, two
    piles of peat, again a glimpse of the heath, and a very light
    sky.</p>

    <p>Look here, what I want to say is this: that's the kind of
    thing you ought to start with, and from the very beginning I
    believe you will do well not to draw exclusively. I mean
    everything I write you here in full, full earnest. I have
    thought it over so long.</p>

    <p>If all had remained well at Goupil's, I should not have
    spoken about it, but under the circumstances it is only because
    of my own wretched financial position that I do not say much
    more positively: come here at once. If it were otherwise, I
    should not use more words than that.</p>

    <p>The country is splendid, splendid, everything calls to you:
    paint! it is so full of character and so varied. Look here,
    boy, isn't it true that however things go, there are always
    financial obstacles, and where or how on earth can a time of
    struggle lead to a more definite peace? - to a great peace
    which nothing on earth can disturb. I for my part can say no
    better than that I give all my own studies as a pledge and
    guarantee for our giving back the money we shall absolutely
    need during the first two years. I think we must be able to
    find it. I have put down the minimum, because both you and I
    would live as economically as possible.</p>

    <p>As for me, I have a lot of plans, but I do wish I had some
    100 guilders to spend to replenish my painting materials. And I
    wish I knew for sure that I could stay here for two years, for
    instance. I now have so little security for the future, and I
    wish I knew for sure that I shall not have to leave again after
    some time. The plan which I have laid down here is open to
    changes.</p>

    <p>But I think its basis remains, we must arrange things so
    that we can work in peace for two years.</p>

    <p>After those two years I shall be so far that I can earn
    regularly, and hope to have regular work on such conditions
    that both you and I can go on in the same way.</p>

    <p>The plan it is simple enough; people would gossip about you,
    too, but there would be six hours' walking distance of
    landscape &agrave; la Michel between their wretched little town
    of Hoogeveen and yourself, so it would not trouble you in the
    least, would it? You would be rid of everything, and in about
    your 30th year; even the house Goupil would seem like a dream
    to you, and you would hardly understand that once you were the
    head of the Gallery on the Boulevard, and were treated
    politely, always politely, by Monsieur the Director.</p>

    <p>As to my coming to Paris, well, I think it's a long detour,
    though if you think it better, all right; but it depends so
    entirely on the change you are going to make, and if you change
    <i>in a way other</i> than by becoming a painter, I should be
    afraid that in the end it would have to happen after all, and
    that meanwhile I would again become more difficult. I cannot
    write differently than I do.</p>

    <p>You are a man of business; for this very reason I do not
    think you will be so prejudiced as to reject all this. There
    are always, everywhere, financial obstacles and worries; one
    cannot avoid them anywhere, and after all this is something
    solid, as it will make you a handicrafts one. Is that taking a
    step backward? - no it is not! I think it is the right way. It
    would be a manly action, and action which demands foi de
    charbonnier. So I repeat: you must have that foi de
    charbonnier. Well, boy, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Do write again soon.</p>

    <p>Think of Barbizon, that story is sublime. When those who
    originally started working there came there, by no means all of
    them were externally what they were basically. The country
    formed them, they only knew, It is no good in a city, I must go
    to the country. I suppose they thought, I must learn to work,
    become quite different, yes, the opposite of what I am now.
    They said, I am no good now, I'm going to renew myself in
    nature.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">As for me, I reason in the same way, and though I should go
    to Paris if I absolutely had to, and to find something to do
    there - I think my future here infinitely, infinitely
    better.</label></p>

    <p>Theo, your case is curious, hugely interesting. To have the
    courage to risk it - look, for this you must have foi de
    charbonnier, quand m&ecirc;me, in spite of everything. But now
    think with all coolness of your highly curious position. Now I
    cannot beat about the bush, my dear fellow - and take this in a
    friendly spirit - I shall have to say it the way things appear
    to me. You see your way in the art dealing business, which, as
    it appears to me, makes you something like Wisselingh, to
    mention a good one. I feel great respect for Wisselingh, I like
    him and all that, but <i>even now</i> I should like to tell
    him, Old fellow, go and be a painter, you are much too honest
    for today's art-dealing business, much too clever, etc. Now is
    not the right time for it. But on the contrary, if you will now
    persevere <i>more</i> vigorously, try to find <i>more</i>
    &ldquo;personal energy&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>your own
    handicraft</i>,&rdquo; then say, I will not hesitate, I will
    take the risk, I will push off to the open sea. And you will
    immediately get a certain somber earnestness - something mighty
    serious will rise up within you - one looks at the quiet coast,
    all right, it is pretty enough - but the Secret of the depth,
    the intimate, serious charm of the ocean of an artist's life -
    with Something on High over it - will take hold of you. All
    right, you are no longer a Wisselingh - you are something quite
    different. Personally you say that however small a little ship
    may be in a marine by Jules Dupr&eacute;, you are even smaller
    - but you are greater - you are an artist and you can do
    nothing - certainly, your act of surrender has already changed
    you - in this respect your own power or lack of power is of no
    importance. No, the renewal of life changes your whole
    character, changes your thoughts and opinions, changes them to
    such a degree that you prefer to be silent about it and to
    work. Your work is unbeautiful - all right, let it be
    unbeautiful - it will grieve you, but it will not discourage
    you - after a while you will see a hasty little sketch with a
    je ne sais quoi in it - fine, it this is the harbinger.</p>

    <p>It varies - now you think, I can manage it - then again you
    think it will never succeed - but more and more you learn to
    have foi de charbonnier, and this grows more solid, even if the
    moments of bitter melancholy remain. Very soon art matters
    become so serious that what people say about it becomes
    something like the croaking of ravens. The heath speaks to you;
    you listen to this still voice of nature, and at times nature
    will seem a little bit less hostile, until at last you are her
    friend. Then your work too will be beautiful and calm.</p>

    <p>But nature demands a certain devotion, and she demands a
    period of struggling with her.</p>

    <p>I can't help it, if I want to speak with thorough frankness,
    I am forced to say, Theo, be a painter, try to disentangle
    yourself and come to Drenthe. People will raise a clamour, but
    you won't hear much of it. A six-hour walk full of landscapes
    by Michel lies between you and the ordinary world.</p>

    <p>You would wake up in the morning, and getting up you would
    find yourself near an open farmyard with a cradle in it. There
    you would think better, and feel what Corregio meant by his
    <i>anch'io</i> - I too am a painter; they would say, you are
    not - you would answer, Well, well.</p>

    <p>Well, <i>if</i> you were here, I should have a comrade, and
    this would mean that the work would make better headway. For
    all that, you would not be without friends. Very soon you would
    be on much more jovial terms with Rappard than you were in the
    past. Wisselingh would also remain faithful to you - although
    he would probably advise you against it. If you were here, I
    should become prolific sooner. I say the same - for me alone it
    is almost too big, I always lacked the courage to go on alone.
    I need a person to talk things over with - who knows what a
    picture is.</p>

    <p>The greatest attraction for me in Paris, the thing which
    would most help me to make progress, is being with you, and the
    exchange of ideas with somebody who knows what a picture is,
    and who understands the reasonableness of my quest. I approve
    of Paris because you are in Paris, and as I should be less
    alone there, I should make better progress even there.</p>

    <p>Enough of this for a moment. I do not say it would be
    possible if we couldn't pay for our bread and our workshop. But
    with the sum I mentioned as a minimum, I should most decidedly
    think it possible.</p>

    <p>For myself I have a simple method, I go out into the open
    air and paint what strikes me, breathe the fragrant air of the
    heath deeply, and believe that after a while I shall become
    fresher, newer, better.</p>

    <p>So, boy, do come and paint with me on the heath, in the
    potato field, come and walk with me behind the plough and the
    shepherd - come and sit with me, looking into the fire - let
    the storm that blows across the heath blow through you.</p>

    <p>Break loose from your bonds. I do not know the future, in
    what way it might be different if everything should go smoothly
    with us, but I cannot speak differently: Don't seek it in
    Paris, don't seek it in America; it is always the same, forever
    and ever exactly the same. Make a thorough change indeed, try
    the heath.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, write soon. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
