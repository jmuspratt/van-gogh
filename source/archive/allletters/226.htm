  <body>
    <p>Saturday evening</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>My sincere thanks for your letter and the enclosed. As soon
    as I received your letter I bought 7 guilders' worth of colours
    immediately, so as to have some provisions and to replenish my
    box. All during the week we have had a great deal of wind,
    storm and rain, and I went to Scheveningen several times to see
    it.</p>

    <p>I brought two small marines home from there.</p>

    <p>One of them is slightly sprinkled with sand - but <art id=004>the
    second, made during a real storm, during which the sea came
    quite close to the dunes, was so covered with a thick layer of
    sand that I was obliged to scrape it off twice</art>.
    The wind blew so hard that I could scarcely stay on my feet,
    and could hardly see for the sand that was flying around.
    However, I tried to get it fixed by going to a little inn
    behind the dunes, and there scraped it off and immediately
    painted it in again, returning to the beach now and then for a
    fresh impression. So I brought a few souvenirs home after
    all.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">But another souvenir is that I caught cold again, with all
    the consequences you know of, which now forces me to stay home
    for a few days.</label></p>

    <p>In the meantime, I have painted a few studies of the figure
    - I'm sending you two sketches.</p>

    <p>Painting the figure appeals to me very much, but it must
    ripen - I must get to know the technique better - what is
    sometimes called &ldquo;la cuisine de l'art.&rdquo; In the
    beginning I shall have to do much scraping, and shall often
    have to begin anew, but I feel that I learn from it and that it
    gives me a new, fresh view of things.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">The next time you send money, I shall buy some good marten
    brushes, which are the real <i>drawing</i> brushes, as I have
    discovered, for <i>drawing</i> a hand or a profile in colour.
    Also, I see they are absolutely necessary for very delicate
    branches, etc. No matter how fine, the Lyon brushes make too
    broad stripes or strokes. My painting paper is also almost used
    up - toward the first of September I shall have to buy a few
    more supplies, but I shall not need more than the usual
    allowance.</label></p>

    <p>Then I want to tell you that I quite agree with several
    points in your letter. <label content="attitude.parents">Especially, I fully agree that, with all
    their good and bad qualities, Father and Mother are the kind of
    people who are becoming rare in the present time - more and
    more rare - and perhaps the new type is not at all better - and
    so one must appreciate them that much more.</label></p>

    <p>Personally, I do indeed appreciate them. I am only afraid
    that the feeling about which you reassured them for the time
    being would come back, especially if they saw me again. They
    will never be able to understand what painting is. They cannot
    understand that the figure of a labourer&mdash;some furrows in
    a ploughed field - a bit of sand, sea and sky&mdash;are serious
    subjects, so difficult, but at the same time so beautiful, that
    it is indeed worth while to devote one's life to expressing the
    poetry hidden in them.</p>

    <p>In the future, whenever they saw me toiling and pegging away
    at my work &mdash; scraping it out and changing it &mdash; now
    severely comparing it to nature then changing it a little so
    they can no longer exactly recognize the spot or the figure
    &mdash; it would always be a disappointment to them. They will
    not be able to understand that painting cannot succeed at
    once, and over and over again they will think, &ldquo;He
    doesn't really know anything about it,&rdquo; and that real
    painters would work in quite a different way.</p>

    <p>Well, I dare not allow myself any illusions, and I am afraid
    that Father and Mother may never really appreciate my art. This
    is not surprising, and it is not their fault; they have not
    learned to look at things as you and I have learned to look at
    them. They look at different things than we do; we do not see
    the same things with the same eyes, nor do the same thoughts
    occur to us. It is permissible to wish this were otherwise, but
    in my opinion it is not wise to expect it.</p>

    <p>They will hardly be able to understand my frame of mind, and
    they will not know what urges me on. When they see me doing
    things which they think strange and eccentric, they will
    ascribe them to discontent, indifference, or carelessness,
    whereas in reality there is something quite different at the
    bottom of it, namely, the wish to pursue, co&ugrave;te que
    co&ugrave;te, what I need for my work. Now they are perhaps
    looking forward to the &ldquo;painting in oil.&rdquo; Now at
    last it will come &mdash; and oh! how disappointed they would
    be, I am afraid, if they could see it; they would notice
    nothing but daubs of paint&mdash;besides, they consider drawing
    a &ldquo;<i>preparatory study</i>&rdquo; an expression which
    many years ago I learned to hate inexpressibly, and think as
    incorrect as it can be. As you well know. And when they see me
    still at it, the way I was before, they will think I am going
    to be doing that preparatory study forever.</p>

    <p>Well, let us hope for the best and try to reassure them.</p>

    <p>What you tell me about their new surroundings is very
    interesting. I should certainly love to paint such a little old
    church, and the churchyard with its sandy grave-mounds and old
    wooden crosses. I hope I shall have the chance sometime.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">Then you write about the stretch of heath and the pine wood
    close by. I can tell you, I feel an everlasting homesickness
    for heath and pine trees, with the characteristic figures - a
    poor woman gathering wood, a poor peasant carrying sand - in
    short, those simple things that have something of the grandeur
    of the sea. I have always had a wish to go and live somewhere
    quite in the country, if I had an opportunity and circumstances
    would permit.</label> But I have plenty of subjects here - the woods,
    the beach, the Rijswijk meadows near by, and so, literally, a
    new subject at every footstep.</p>

    <p>But it would also be to live more cheaply.</p>

    <p>But for the moment, as far as I can see, there is no
    immediate reason, and so I am in no hurry.</p>

    <p>I only tell you so you'll realize how sympathetic I am to
    scenery like that which you describe as Father and Mother's new
    surroundings.</p>

    <p>It is the painting that makes me so happy these days. I
    restrained myself up to now, and stuck to drawing just because
    I know so many sad stories of people who threw themselves
    headlong into painting - who sought the solution of their
    problems in technique and awoke disillusioned, without having
    made any progress, but having become up to their ears in debt
    because of the expensive things they had spoiled.</p>

    <p>I had feared and dreaded this from the start: I have
    considered drawing, and still do, the only way to avoid such a
    fate, and I have grown to love drawing instead of considering
    it a nuisance. Now, however, painting has unexpectedly given me
    much scope: it enables me to see effects that were unattainable
    before - just the ones which, after all, appeal to me most -
    and it enlightens me so much more on many questions and gives
    me new means by which to express effects. All together, these
    things make me very happy.</p>

    <p>It has been so beautiful in Scheveningen lately. The sea was
    even more impressive before the gale, than while it raged.
    During the gale, one could not see the waves so well, and the
    effect was less of a furrowed field. The waves followed each
    other so quickly that one overlapped the other, and the clash
    of the masses of water raised a spray which, like drifting
    sand, wrapped the foreground in a sort of haze. It was a fierce
    storm, and if one looked at it long, even more fierce, even
    more impressive, because it made so little noise. The sea was
    the colour of dirty soapsuds. There was one fishing smack on
    that spot, the last of the row, and a few dark little
    figures.</p>

    <p>There is something infinite in painting - I cannot explain
    it to you so well - but it is so delightful just for expressing
    one's feelings. There are hidden harmonies or contrasts in
    colours which Involuntarily combine to work together and which
    could not possibly be used in another way.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow I hope to go and work in the open air again.</p>

    <p>I have read most of Zola's La Faute de l'Abb&eacute; Mouret
    and Son Excellence Eug&egrave;ne Rougon, both beautiful. I
    think Pascal Rougon, the doctor who appears in his series of
    books, but always in the background, a noble figure. He really
    proves that no matter how degenerate a race may be, it is
    always possible for energy and will-power to conquer fate. In
    his profession he found a force stronger than the temperament
    he had inherited from his family; instead of surrendering to
    his natural instincts, he followed a clear, straight path, and
    did not slide into the wretched muddle in which all the other
    Rougons perished. He and Madame Fran&ccedil;ois of Le Ventre de
    Paris are to me the most sympathetic figures.</p>

    <p>Well, adieu, I often think of you, and how I should love to
    see you now and then. A handshake in thought and believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>While writing this I have done another study, of a boy -
    grey, charcoal, oil, and very little colour, just for the
    tone.</p>
