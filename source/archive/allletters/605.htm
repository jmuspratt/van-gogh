  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I think what you say in your letter is quite right, that
    Rousseau and artists such as Bodmer are in any case <i>men</i>,
    and that one would want the world to be peopled with men like
    them - indeed, yes, that's how I feel as well.</p>

    <p>And that J. H. Weissenbruch knows &amp; does the muddy
    towpaths, the stunted willows, the foreshortenings &amp; the
    skilful &amp; strange perspectives of the canals, as Daumier
    does the lawyers, I think that's perfect. Tersteeg has done
    well to buy some of his work. The reason people like that don't
    sell is, I think, because there are too many dealers trying to
    sell other things with which they deceive &amp; mislead the
    public.</p>

    <p>Do you know that even today, when I chance upon the story of
    some energetic industrialist, or even more of some publisher, I
    still feel the same indignation, the same rage as I used to
    when I was with G. &amp; Cie.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.apprehension">Life passes in this way, time does not return, but I am
    working furiously for the very reason that I know that
    opportunities for work do not recur.</p>

    <p>Especially in my case, where a more violent attack could
    destroy my ability to paint for good.</label></p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">During the attacks I feel cowardly in the face of the pain
    and suffering - more cowardly than is justified - and perhaps
    it is this moral cowardice itself, which previously I had no
    desire to cure, that now makes me eat for two, work hard, and
    limit my relations with the other patients for fear of falling
    ill again - in short, I am trying to recover, like someone who
    has meant to commit suicide, but then makes for the bank
    because he finds the water too cold.</label></p>

    <p>My dear brother, you know that I came to the south and threw
    myself into work for a thousand reasons - looking for a
    different light, believing that observing nature under a
    brighter sky might give one a more accurate idea of the way the
    Japanese feel and draw. Wanting, finally, to see this stronger
    sun, because one has the feeling that unless one knows it one
    would not be able to understand the pictures of Delacroix, as
    far as execution and technique are concerned, and because one
    feels that the colours of the prism are veiled in the mists of
    the north.</p>

    <p>All this remains more or less true. Then if one adds that
    heartfelt leaning towards the south Daudet described in
    Tartarin, and the fact that from time to time I have also found
    friends and things to love here, then you will understand that
    however horrible I find my illness, I have the feeling that I
    have formed ties here that are a little too strong - ties which
    could later make me long to come back and work here again.
    Despite all this it could be that I shall be returning to the
    north fairly soon.</p>

    <p>Yes, for I shall not conceal from you that in the same way
    that I am at present eating ravenously, so I have a terrible
    craving to see my friends again and the countryside of the
    north.</p>

    <p>Work is going very well, I am discovering things I have
    sought in vain for years, and, aware of that, I am constantly
    reminded of that saying of Delacroix's you know, that he
    discovered painting when he had neither breath nor teeth left.
    Oh well, with my mental illness, I think of so many other
    artists suffering mentally, and tell myself that it doesn't
    stop one from carrying on one's trade as painter as if nothing
    had gone wrong.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">When I see that here the attacks tend to take an absurdly
    religious turn, I might almost believe that this actually
    <i>necessitates</i> a return to the north. Don't say too much
    about it to the doctor when you see him - but I don't know
    whether it comes from living so many months both at the
    hospital in Arles and here in these old cloisters. In fact, I
    really shouldn't live in such surroundings, the street would be
    better.</label> I am not indifferent, and even as I suffer, religious
    thoughts sometimes give me great consolation. I had a piece of
    bad luck this last time during my illness - that lithograph of
    Delacroix's, La Piet&agrave; along with some other
    sheets, fell into some oil and paint and was ruined.</p>

    <p>I was very sad about it - <art id=0630>so I have been busy painting it
    and you will see it one day on a size 5 or 6 canvas</art>. I have made <art id=0757>a copy of it</art>
    which I think has some feeling. Besides, having seen Daniel and Les
    Odalisques and the portrait of Bruyas and La
    mul&acirc;tresse in Montpellier not long ago, I am still
    under the impression they made on me.</p>

    <p>That is what uplifts me, and also reading a fine book such
    as one by Beecher Stowe or by Dickens. But what disturbs me is
    the constant sight of these good women, who both believe in the
    Virgin of Lourdes and make up that sort of thing, and realizing
    that one is a prisoner of an administration that is only too
    willing to cultivate these unhealthy religious aberrations when
    it should be concerned with curing them. So I say again, better
    to go, if not into penal servitude, at least into the army.</p>

    <p>I reproach myself with my cowardice, I ought to have
    defended my studio better, even if it meant coming to blows
    with the gendarmes &amp; the neighbours. Others would have used
    a revolver in my place, and had one killed gawking idiots like
    that, as an artist one would certainly have been acquitted. It
    would have been better had I done that, but I was cowardly and
    drunk - ill too, but I wasn't brave.</p>

    <p>I'm also very frightened in the face of the suffering
    brought on by these attacks, and so I don't know if my zeal is
    anything other than what I said, it is like that of someone who
    means to commit suicide, but then struggles for the shore
    because he finds the water too cold.</p>

    <p>But listen, to be in board and lodgings as Braat was when I
    saw him that time - happily long ago - no, and no again.</p>

    <p>It would be different if old Pissarro or Vignon, for
    instance, would care to take me in. Well, I'm a painter myself
    - it could be arranged, and it would be better if the money
    went to feed painters than to the excellent nuns.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I asked M. Peyron point-blank, since you are going
    to Paris, what would you say if I suggested that you be kind
    enough to take me with you? His reply was evasive - that it was
    too sudden, that he would have to write to you beforehand.</p>

    <p>But he is very kind and very indulgent towards me, and while
    he doesn't have the final say here, far from it, I have him to
    thank for many liberties.</p>

    <p>After all, one shouldn't only make pictures, one should see
    people too, and every now and then, by associating with others,
    recuperate a little and stock up on new ideas.</p>

    <p>I've abandoned any hope that it won't come back - on the
    contrary, we must face the fact that I will have an attack from
    time to time. But at those times I could go into an asylum or
    even into the town prison where they usually have an isolation
    cell.</p>

    <p>Don't be anxious, in any case - the work is going well, and
    look, I don't need to tell you that I've still got a lot of
    things to do, wheat fields, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>I've done the portrait of the attendant [Lost painting] and
    have got <art id=0629>a copy of it for you</art>. It makes a
    fairly curious contrast with the portrait I've done of myself,
    in which the look is vague and veiled, whereas he has a
    military air and small, lively, black eyes.</p>

    <p>I have given it to him, and I'll do his wife as well, if she
    wants to pose. She is a woman whose looks have faded, a poor
    soul, resigned to her fate, nothing out of the ordinary and so
    insignificant that I simply long to paint that dusty blade of
    grass. I talked to her sometimes when I was doing some olive
    trees behind their little house, and she told me then that she
    didn't believe I was ill - in fact, you would now say the same
    if you saw me working, my mind clear and my fingers so sure
    that I drew that Piet&Atilde;&nbsp; by Delacroix without taking
    a single measurement, though there are those four hands and
    arms in the foreground - gestures and postures that are not
    exactly easy or simple.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">Please send me the canvas <i>soon,</i> if at all possible,
    and I think I'm also going to need 10 more tubes of zinc
    white.</label></p>

    <p>All the same, I'm sure that if one is brave then recovery
    comes from within, through the complete acceptance of suffering
    and death, and through the surrender of one's will and love of
    self. But that's no good to me, I like to paint, to see people
    and things and everything that makes our life - artificial, if
    you like. Yes, real life would be something else, but I don't
    think I belong to that category of souls who are ready to live,
    and also ready to suffer, at any moment.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">What an odd thing the <i>touch</i>, the stroke of the brush,
    is.</p>

    <p>In the open air, exposed to the wind, to the sun, to
    people's curiosity, one works as best one can, one fills one's
    canvas regardless. Yet that is how one captures the true and
    the essential - the most difficult part. But when, after some
    time, one resumes the study and alters the brushstrokes in
    keeping with the objects - the result is without doubt more
    harmonious and pleasant to look at, and one can add whatever
    serenity and happiness one feels.</label></p>

    <p>Ah, I shall never be able to convey my impressions of some
    of the figures I have seen here. Certainly, this is the new
    road, this road to the south, but men from the north find it
    difficult to follow. And I can already see myself one day in
    the future enjoying some small success, and missing the
    solitude and the anguish as I watched the reaper in the field
    below through the iron bars of my cell. It's an ill
    wind&hellip;</p>

    <p>To succeed, to enjoy lasting good fortune, one must have a
    different temperament from mine. I shall never do what I could
    have done and ought to have wanted and pursued.</p>

    <p>But, having these dizzy spells so often, I can never be more
    than fourth or fifth rate. Although I am well aware of the
    worth and originality and superiority of Delacroix or Millet,
    for example, I can still say, yes, I too am something, I too
    can achieve something. But I must take these artists as my
    starting point, and then produce the little I am capable of in
    the same way.</p>

    <p>So old Pissarro has been dealt two cruel blows all at once.
    <sup>1</sup> As soon as I read about it, I thought of asking
    you if there would be any way of going and staying with him. If
    you paid him the same as here, he would find it worth his
    while, for I don't need much - except for work. So ask him
    straight out, and if he doesn't like the idea, I could easily
    go and stay with Vignon.</p>

    <p>I am a little afraid of Pont-Aven, there are so many people
    there. But what you say about Gauguin interests me very much.
    And I still tell myself that Gauguin and I will perhaps work
    together again. I know that G. can do even better things than
    he has done, but how to reassure him! I still hope to do his
    portrait. Have you seen that portrait he did of me painting
    sunflowers? My face has certainly brightened up since then, but
    it was really me, extremely tired and charged with electricity
    as I was then.</p>

    <p>Yet to see the country, one must live with the ordinary folk
    and in the cottages, the inns, etc. And I said that to Boch,
    who complained he had seen nothing that had tempted him or made
    an impression on him.</p>

    <p>I walked around with him for two days, and I showed him how
    to do thirty pictures as different from the north as Morocco
    would be. I'd be curious to know what he's doing at the
    moment.</p>

    <p>And then, do you know why Eug. Delacroix's pictures - the
    religious and historical pictures,<art id=elacroix> La barque du Christ</art>, La
    Piet&Atilde;&nbsp;, Les crois&eacute;s, have this allure?
    Because Eug. Delacroix, when he did a Gethsemane, had been
    beforehand to see what an olive grove was like on the spot, and
    the same for the sea whipped up by a strong mistral, and
    because he must have said to himself, these people we know from
    history, doges of Venice, crusaders, apostles, holy women, were
    of the same type as, and lived in a similar way to, their
    present-day descendants.</p>

    <p>And I must tell you, and you can see it in <art id=0508>La Berceuse</art>,
    however unsuccessful and feeble that attempt may be, if I had
    had the strength to continue, then I should have done portraits
    of saints and holy women from life which would have seemed to
    belong to another age, and they would have been drawn from the
    bourgeoisie of today and yet would have had something in common
    with the very earliest Christians.</p>

    <p>The emotions that are aroused are, however, too strong, so
    I'll leave it at that - but later, later, I don't promise not
    to return to the charge.</p>

    <p>What a great man Fromentin was - he will always be the guide
    for any who wish to see the east. He, the first to establish a
    link between Rembrandt and the south, between Potter and what
    he himself saw.</p>

    <p>You are right a thousand times over - I mustn't think about
    all that - to calm down I must do things - even if they're only
    studies of cabbages and lettuces, and after calming down, then
    - whatever I am capable of.</p>

    <p>When I see them again, I'll do some copies of those studies
    of <art id=0478a>the Diligence of Tarascon</art>, <art id=0495>the Vineyard</art>,
    <art id=0412>the Harvest</art>, and above all of <art id=0463>the Red Tavern, that Night
    Caf&eacute;</art> which is the most characteristic of all as far as colour is
    concerned. But the white figure in the middle must be done all
    over again for the colour, and better composed. Still, I'd go
    so far as to say that this is the real south, and a calculated
    combination of greens and reds.</p>

    <p>My strength has been all too quickly exhausted, but in the
    distance I can see the possibility of others doing an infinite
    number of fine things. And again and again there is truth in
    the idea that to make the journey easier for others it would
    have been a good thing to set up a studio somewhere in this
    area.</p>

    <p>To make the journey in one go from the north to Spain, for
    example, is not a good thing, you will not see what you should
    see - you must g<i>et your eyes accustomed</i> gradually to the
    different light.</p>

    <p>I really don't need to see the Titians and
    Vel&Atilde;&iexcl;squezs in the galleries, I've seen so many
    types in the flesh that have given me a better picture of the
    south now than before my journey.</p>

    <p>My God, my God, those good people among artists who say that
    Delacroix is not of the true east. Now look, is the true east
    what Parisians like G&eacute;r&Atilde;&acute;me make of
    it? Because you paint a bit of sunny wall from nature, well and
    truly according to our <i>northern</i> way of seeing things,
    does that prove that you have seen the people of the east? That
    was what Delacroix was searching for, and it in no way
    prevented him from painting walls in La noce juive and Les
    odalisques.</p>

    <p>Isn't that true? - and then Degas says that it costs too
    much to drink in the taverns and paint pictures at the same
    time. I don't deny it, but would he rather I went into the
    cloisters or the churches? It is there that I myself get
    frightened. That's why I make a bid to escape with this
    letter.</p>

    <p>With many handshakes for you and Jo,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I still have to congratulate you on the occasion of Mother's
    birthday. I wrote to them yesterday, but the letter has not yet
    gone because I have not had the presence of mind to finish it.
    It is queer that already, two or three times before, I had had
    the idea of going to Pissarro's; this time, after your telling
    me of his recent misfortunes, I do not hesitate to ask you
    this.</p>

    <p>Yes, we must finish with this place, I cannot do the two
    things at once, work and take no end of pains to live with
    these queer patients here - it is upsetting.</p>

    <p>In vain I tried to force myself to go downstairs. And yet it
    is nearly two months since I have been out in the open air.</p>

    <p>In the long run I shall lose the faculty for work here, and
    that is where I begin to call a halt, and I shall send them
    then - if you agree - about their business.</p>

    <p>And then to go on paying for it, no, then one or other of
    the artists who is hard up will agree to keep house with me. It
    is fortunate that you can write saying you are well, and Jo
    too, and that her sister is with you.</p>

    <p>I very much wish that, when your child comes, I might be
    back - not with you, certainly <i>not</i>, that is impossible,
    but in the neighbourhood of Paris with another painter. I could
    mention a third alternative, my going to the Jouves, who have a
    lot of children and quite a household.</p>

    <p>You understand that I have tried to compare the second
    attack with the first, and I only tell you this, it seemed to
    me to stem from some influence or other from outside, rather
    than from within myself. I may be mistaken, but however it may
    be, I think you will feel it quite right that I have rather a
    horror of all religious exaggeration. The good M. Peyron will
    tell you heaps of things, probabilities and possibilities, and
    involuntary acts. Very good, but if he is more precise than
    that I shall believe none of it. And we shall see then <i>what
    he will be precise about</i>, if he is precise. The
    treatment of patients in this hospital is certainly easy, one
    could follow it even while travelling, for they do absolutely
    <i>nothing</i>; they leave them to vegetate in idleness and
    feed them with stale and slightly spoiled food. And I will tell
    you now that from the first day I refused to take this food,
    and until my attack I ate only bread and a little soup, and as
    long as I remain here I shall continue this way. It is true
    that after this attack M. Peyron gave me some wine and meat,
    which I accepted willingly the first days, but I wouldn't want
    to be an excep-tion to the rule for long, and it is right to
    respect the regular rules of the establishment. I must also say
    that M. Peyron does not give me much hope for the future, and
    this I think right, he makes me realize properly that
    <i>everything</i> is doubtful, that one can be sure of nothing
    beforehand. I myself expect it to return, but it is just that
    work takes up my mind so thoroughly, that I think that with the
    physique I have, things may continue for a long time in this
    way.</p>

    <p>The idleness in which these poor unfortunates vegetate is a
    pest, but there, it is a general evil in the towns and
    countryside under this stronger sunshine, and having learnt a
    differ-ent way of life, certainly it is my duty to resist it. I
    finish this letter by thanking you again for yours and begging
    you to write to me again soon, and with many handshakes in
    thought.</p>
