  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>One of the causes of my sometimes thinking of moving might
    be eliminated in another way. Yesterday and the day before I
    have been strolling around the neighborhood of Loosduinen. I
    walked from the village to the beach, and found lots of
    cornfields there, not so beautiful as those in Brabant, but
    there must be reapers, sowers and gleaners, all those things
    which I have missed this year, which was the reason for my
    occasionally feeling the need for a change.</p>

    <p>I do not know whether you have seen that region. I had never
    been there before. I painted a study there on the beach. There
    are some sea dikes or moles, piers, jetties, and very
    picturesque ones too, made of weather-beaten stones and
    wickerwork. I sat down on one of them and painted the rising
    tide till it came so near that I had to move my things in a
    hurry. Between the village and the beach are bushes of a deep
    bronzed green, tangled by the sea wind, and so striking that
    more than once one thinks, oh, now that's <i>the</i>
    &ldquo;Buisson&rdquo; by Ruysdael. A streetcar is running there
    now, so it is within easy reach when one has equipment or wet
    studies to carry home.</p>

    <p><?showImage("363_V-T_3070");?>
     This is a scratch of the path to the beach.</p>

    <p>My thoughts were with you all during the walk.</p>

    <p>I know you will agree with me that the dunes around The
    Hague and Scheveningen have lost much of their typical
    character in the last ten years, and are getting another, more
    frivolous aspect, more and more each year.</p>

    <p>Going back, not only ten, but thirty, even forty or fifty
    years, one comes to the period when they began to paint the
    dunes, etc., in their true character. At that time things were
    more Ruysdael-like than now.</p>

    <p>If one wants to see things with a Daubigny, a Corot
    atmosphere, one must go farther, where the soil is almost
    untrodden by bathing guests, etc. Undoubtedly Scheveningen is
    very beautiful, but nature is no longer untouched there;
    however, that same untouched quality of nature struck me
    enormously during that walk I told you about.</p>

    <p><?showImage("363_V-T_3071");?>
    </p>

    <p>This will give you an idea of the pier.</p>

    <p>Rarely has silence, has nature alone impressed me in such a
    way recently. These very spots where nothing is left of what
    one called civilization, where all that is definitely left
    behind, these very spots are those one needs to get calmed
    down.</p>

    <p>But I would have liked to have you with me, because I think
    you would have had the same impression of being in surroundings
    such as I imagine Scheveningen must of been at the time when
    the first Daubignys appeared, and I found those surroundings
    full of a strong, stimulating vigour inducing one to undertake
    some manly work.</p>

    <p>When you come, it will perhaps be fun to go there together,
    with no civilization around us, only a poor rickety shell cart
    on the white road; and for the rest, shrubs that look, every
    one of them, like <i>the</i> &ldquo;Buisson&rdquo; by Ruysdael.
    The landscape itself very simple, flat: stretches of ragged
    dune soil, hardly undulating.</p>

    <p>I think if we were together on that spot, it would put you
    and me into a mood such that we would not hesitate about the
    work, but feel decisive about what we have to do. Was it a
    chance harmony of my rather gloomy mood with those
    surroundings, or shall I find the same impressions there again
    in the future? I don't know, but when I again feel the need to
    forget the present and to think of the time when the great
    revolution in art began, of which Millet, Daubigny, Breton,
    Troyon, Corot are the leaders, I will go to that same spot once
    more.</p>

    <p>I wish you could see it; perhaps when you come we might take
    a stroll there together - the streetcar brings one to
    Loosduinen in a moment, it even goes as far as Naaldwijk now.
    Those level grounds behind Loosduinen are exactly like Michel -
    and the lonely beach too.</p>

    <p>Though, after our last letters, I think less about the
    future than about the present, and I still hope that when you
    come we shall decide that I shall make a number of small
    watercolours for you, and perhaps some small oil paintings,
    just as an experiment.</p>

    <p>If I could only manage to have money enough to carry on my
    painting vigorously this year.</p>

    <p>That walk, all by myself, far away in the dunes, has quieted
    me by making me feel as if I had not been alone, but had had a
    talk with one of the old painters from that time when Daubigny
    was beginning.</p>

    <p>I shouldn't be surprised if you also remember that spot once
    you had walked there.</p>

    <p>While writing this letter, I have started a watercolour of
    that bush; I painted a study of the other thing - the jetty -
    so at all events I have a souvenir of the walk, which I can
    show you when you come. And if you like, we can take a walk
    there together.</p>

    <p>For the rest, I am not entirely myself yet; perhaps my
    <label subject="health.gastrointestinal.stomach">stomach has become too weak,
    </label> judging from the <label subject="psychology.neurological.dizziness">symptoms of
    dizziness,</label> which is troublesome enough to make curing it
    urgent. But enough of this.</p>

    <p>This is as far as I wrote yesterday. Now today - Monday - I
    can tell you that fortunately the torn banknote has been
    accepted in Paris, and I have lost but little on it, having
    cashed 23 guilders in all.</p>

    <p>Now I have to talk something over with you which I hope you
    will approve of. In a previous letter I told you my definite
    opinion that it would be unwarranted for us not to try to
    profit by the wholesale prices of the colours, instead of
    always paying the regular retail price, in this way losing 33
    1/3%. But because you didn't answer this year, I thought that
    it would perhaps be difficult to order things in Goupil and
    company's name that were destined for more private use, and on
    my side I made some arrangements, which I had already started
    tentatively before, in order to get the same thing without your
    being involved, and I hope for heaven's sake that you do not
    doubt its practicability.</p>

    <p>You know that I give lessons to a land surveyor; well, his
    father has a drug store and deals in colours, has Paillard's
    colours in stock, and Mauve is a customer. I never got anything
    for those lessons to the son except many assurances of goodwill
    from the father. And availing myself of these, I spoke to him
    as follows: that undoubtedly he had in stock a certain number
    of unsaleable tubes. That I could use them, however, but would
    take them only at Paillard's wholesale price, provided that in
    the future he would sell me the popular tubes on the same
    terms.</p>

    <p>At first he made some objections; then he looked over his
    stock, and we made the above arrangement. I take about 300
    tubes from him, including several carmine and ultramarine, at
    <i>less</i> than Paillard's wholesale price (10 guilders less
    on the whole lot, which, at Paillard's wholesale price, would
    cost more than 50 guilders), so that those 300 tubes cost me 40
    guilders. Besides, it gives me the right to order in the future
    all colours I need at Paillard's wholesale price, thus saving
    33 1/3%. I have that reduction not only on the oil but also on
    the watercolours.</p>

    <p>We can talk it over when you come. Of course I needn't take
    or pay for those 300 tubes all at once, but in as many
    installments as I like, monthly for instance. But I am glad of
    it, because 33 1/3% will make a great difference, especially in
    the long run. In this way it will be easier for me to continue
    my painting.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Today I have bought a tripod easel for sketching out of
    doors and canvas. The former is very convenient, because it
    keeps one from getting so dirty when one has to work on one's
    knees out of doors.</label> For the moment I have about seven
    watercolours of this summer landscape. I used part of the money
    you sent to buy myself some nourishing food, but I do not have
    much appetite, as my stomach is upset, and I am afraid it will
    be some time before I get over it. I shall be glad when you
    come, I think it will be good for many reasons.</p>

    <p>I hope you will be able to send the usual amount again by
    the first of August.</p>

    <p>At all events I am glad I have some painted studies to show
    you when you come.</p>

    <p>I have a model, a peasant boy, who lives here in the
    neighborhood, with whom I have already spoken about painting
    studies. For instance, he could manage to leave with me very
    early in the morning, and go quite far into the dunes. Adieu,
    all best wishes. Believe me,</p>
