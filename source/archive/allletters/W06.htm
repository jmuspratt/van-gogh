    <p>Arles, c. 21 August 1888</p>

    <p>Dear Sister,</p>

    <p>I write you these few words in a hurry, as I don't want to
    postpone telling you how pleased I am that you are in Paris,
    and I suppose you are going to see a lot of things in the days
    to come. It is not quite impossible that next year, when I
    shall be living with my friend Gauguin, you will happen to go
    as far as the Mediterranean. I am convinced you too will think
    it beautiful here.</p>

    <p>What is your opinion of <art id=egresses>that picture of Gauguin's, the one
    with those Negresses which Theo has</art>? - I could imagine you
    might understand it. At the moment <art id=0456>I am working on a bunch of
    twelve sunflowers in a yellow earthenware pot</art>,
    and I intend to decorate the whole studio with nothing but
    sunflowers.</p>

    <p>I hope you will go often to the Luxembourg, and also to go
    see the modern pictures in the Louvre, so that you will gain an
    understanding of what a Millet, a Jules Breton, a Daubigny, a
    Corot is. I make you a present of all the rest - except
    Delacroix.</p>

    <p>Although at present they are working in quite a different
    manner, the work of Delacroix, and Millet, and Corot will last,
    and the changes in style will not affect it.</p>

    <p>I hope when you go back to Holland you will take along some
    study of mine to decorate your room.</p>

    <p>If I can get the mother and father to allow me to do a
    picture of it, I am going to paint a baby in a cradle one of
    these days. The father has refused to have it baptized - he is
    an ardent revolutionary - and when the family grumbled,
    possibly on account of the christening feast, he told them that
    the christening feast would take place nonetheless, and that he
    would baptize the child himself. Then he sang the
    &ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo; in a frightful voice, after which he
    called the child Marcelle, after the daughter of &ldquo;le brav
    g&eacute;n&eacute;ral Boulanger,&rdquo; to the great
    indignation of this innocent baby's grandmother and some other
    members of the family.</p>

    <p>I am getting to think the country here more and more
    beautiful. Have you read Tartarin de Tarascon by Daudet? You
    should, you know, and Tartarin sur les Alpes, for they are
    certainly not among the least of Daudet's novels.</p>

    <p>I am sure you will observe that in summer the sun is a great
    deal hotter in Paris than at home.</p>

    <p>I think I should not object to going even a bit farther, I
    mean where the country is less flat, seeing that in point of
    fact I never saw a mountain in my life. As soon as Gauguin is
    here, I suppose we shall do it. But until then I am going to
    stay in Arles. And after he has come I should like to go on a
    walking tour with him all over Provence.</p>

    <p>I am very busy working on my sunflowers, and in reality I
    have nothing to say.</p>

    <p>So I had better stop. Wishing you and Theo truly nice days
    and fine weather,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
