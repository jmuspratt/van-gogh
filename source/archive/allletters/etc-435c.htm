    <p><i>Nuenen</i> [by Anton Kerssemakers]</p>

    <p>It was some years after his stay in the Borinage - when,
    after having worked in The Hague and in Drenthe, he had come to
    stay in Nuenen, about the year 1884 that I made the painter's
    acquaintance.</p>

    <p>At the time I was engaged in painting a number of landscapes
    on the walls of my office, instead of having them covered with
    wallpaper, and in his peculiar way my house painter, who
    furnished me with colours, thought this so nice that one day he
    brought Van Gogh along to show him my work.</p>

    <p>Van Gogh was of the opinion that I could draw, and
    kind-heartedly, as was his way, he at once showed himself
    willing to help me on with my painting. The consequence was our
    more intimate acquaintanceship and, on his friendly invitation,
    my visit to his studio at Nuenen, to which 1 shall revert later
    on.</p>

    <p>My house painter had quite a lot of confidence in Van Gogh,
    and prepared for him the colours he most needed, such as the
    whites and the ochres and some others.</p>

    <p>Seeing that the house painter was no expert at this job,
    these colours often left much to be desired in the matter of
    consistency, but Van Gogh had to content himself with them
    because of a lack of money.</p>

    <p>I still have a little study as a souvenir of this
    unmanageable paint.</p>

    <p>He painted it in a great hurry at my house, to instruct me;
    it was a view from my window in winter with melting snow, and
    the thin white colour ran all over the landscape.</p>

    <p>On the occasion of my first visit to his studio at Nuenen it
    was impossible for me to get the right insight into his work;
    it was so totally different from what I had imagined it would
    be up to then, so rough and unkempt, so harsh and unfinished,
    that with the best will in the world I was unable to think it
    good or beautiful; and, badly disappointed, I decided not to go
    and see him again, and go my own way.</p>

    <p>However, shortly afterward I discovered that his work had
    made a certain impression on me after all, which it was
    impossible for me to dismiss from my mind; every now and then
    his studies rose up before my mind's eye again, so that I
    resolved to pay him another visit; it was as if I were drawn to
    it.</p>

    <p>At my second visit the impression I got was considerably
    better, although in my ignorance I still thought that either he
    could not draw or that he carelessly neglected to draw his
    figures, and so on, and I took the liberty of telling him so
    straight out.</p>

    <p>He was not at all cross at this, he only laughed a little
    and said quietly, Later on you will think differently. When I
    went away, he gave me some engravings from <i>The Graphic</i>
    and some by Adolf Menzel and others to take with me, saying
    that he advised me to look them over carefully and unhurriedly
    at home, and study them and draw copies of them. &ldquo;You
    will learn a thing or two from this.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>On another occasion I took along a number of small studies
    that I had painted in the meantime, so as to hear what he would
    have to say about them.</p>

    <p>Probably in order not to discourage me he said:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, after all there is some good in it. But now I
    advise you to try and make a few still lifes first instead of
    landscapes; you will learn a lot from that. After you have
    painted some fifty of them, you will see how much progress you
    have made. And I am willing to help you and to paint the same
    subjects along with you, for I myself still have a good deal to
    learn, and there is nothing to equal this for learning to put
    things in their right positions, and for learning to get them
    properly separated in space.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In this way, for days and even weeks on end, he tried to
    help me on with the utmost patience, in the meantime working on
    hard himself, doing innumerable drawings and watercolour
    sketches and studies in oil, indoors and out.</p>

    <p>Once, when I had pretty well lost courage, and said to him,
    &ldquo;Oh, I don't think anything can be done with me I am too
    old to turn myself into a painter,&rdquo; he mentioned a number
    of painters who had started late in life, and had become great
    masters for all that, including H. W. Mesdag.</p>

    <p>Once, when we sat together in my studio painting the same
    still life, nothing more than a pair of wooden shoes and some
    pots taken at random, and I sat daubing away at it in my own
    manner, laying on the colour and scratching it off again
    without being able to get any relief into it, he suddenly
    walked over to me: &ldquo;Look here, now you put - no, you
    needn't be afraid I'll spoil your drawing - a vigorous dark
    transparent touch there and there&rdquo; - and at the same time
    he was already assailing my tiny canvas with his big broad
    brush. &ldquo;Do you see? Like that. Look, now the other part
    comes to the front. It is wrong to go brushing away on the same
    spot, you must set it all down at once and then leave it alone;
    don't be afraid, and don't try to make it pretty.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;We'll say we've done enough here for today, and now
    we must go and paint in the open air for a change; I'll come
    here, if you like, or else you might come to Nuenen again; I
    know enough nice interesting spots there.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So it came about that we made various painting excursions in
    the Nuenen district, as for instance to that little old
    medieval chapel that stood in the middle of a cornfield, and to
    the beautiful old windmill in the vicinity of Lieshout, of
    which I later saw in his house such a dashing, vigorous study
    with those small square sheep low down along the mill.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">In those days he was starving like a true Bohemian, and more
    than once it happened that he did not see meat (for the purpose
    of eating) for six weeks on end, always just dry bread with a
    chunk of cheese. It won't go bad on the road, he would say. The
    following story may serve as proof that he was quite
    accustomed to this and would not have it otherwise. Once in
    Nuenen, when we were about to set out on a ramble - it was in
    the afternoon at the height of summer - I said, &ldquo;To begin
    with we'll have a pot of coffee made in that inn over there,
    and eat a lot of bread and butter with trimmings, then we shall
    be able to keep going until late this evening.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>No sooner said than done, for he invariably consented to
    whatever you proposed.</p>

    <p>The table was well furnished with various kinds of bread,
    cheese, sliced ham and so on.</p>

    <p>When I looked, I saw he was eating dry bread and cheese, and
    I said, &ldquo;Come on, Vincent, do take some ham, and butter
    your bread, and put some sugar in your coffee; after all, it
    has to be paid for whether you eat it or not.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that would be coddling
    myself too much: bread and cheese is what I am used to,&rdquo;
    and he calmly went on eating.</label></p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.alcohol">On the other hand he liked to have some brandy in his flask
    on his rambles, and he would not have liked to do without it;
    but as far as I know this was the only luxury he permitted
    himself.</label> His studio too - he had rented a couple of rooms in
    the sexton's house - had quite a Bohemian look.</p>

    <p>One was amazed at the way all the available hanging or
    standing room was filled with paintings, drawings in
    watercolour and in crayon, heads of men and women whose
    clownish turned-up noses, protruding cheekbones and large ears
    were strongly accentuated, the rough paws calloused and
    furrowed, weavers and weaving looms, women spooling yarn,
    potato planters, women weeding, innumerable still lifes,
    certainly as many as ten studies in oils of the little old
    chapel at Nuenen that I mentioned, which he was so enthusiastic
    about that he had painted it in all seasons and in all
    weathers. (Later this little chapel was pulled down by the
    Nuenen vandals, as he called them.)</p>

    <p>A great heap of ashes around the stove, which had never
    known a brush or stove polish, a small number of chairs with
    frayed cane bottoms, a cupboard with at least thirty different
    bird's nests, all kinds of mosses and plants brought along from
    the moor, some stuffed birds, a spool, a spinning wheel, a
    complete set of farm tools, old caps and hats, coarse bonnets
    and hoods, wooden shoes, etc., etc.</p>

    <p>Paintbox and palette he had had made in Nuenen according to
    his directions, as well as a perspective frame; this consisted
    of an iron bar with a long sharp point, on which he could
    mount, by means of screws, an empty frame like a small window.
    He said, The painters of old used a perspective frame at times,
    so why shouldn't we?</p>

    <p>Some time later I visited a number of museums in his
    company, the National Museum at Amsterdam being the first.</p>

    <p>As I was unable to spend the night away from home for
    domestic reasons, he went the day before and made an
    appointment to meet me the next day in the third-class waiting
    room of the Central Station at Amsterdam.</p>

    <p>When I came into this waiting room I saw quite a crowd of
    people of all sorts, railway guards, workmen, travellers, and
    so on and so forth, gathered near the front windows of the
    waiting room, <label content="lifestyle.clothing">and there he was sitting, surrounded by this mob,
    in all tranquillity, dressed in his shaggy ulster and his
    inevitable fur cap, industriously making a few little city
    views (he had taken a small tin paintbox with him) without
    paying the slightest attention to the loud disrespectful
    observations and critical remarks of the esteemed (?) public.</label>
    As soon as he caught sight of me, he packed up his things quite
    calmly, and we started for the museum. Seeing that the rain was
    coming down in torrents, and Van Gogh in his fur cap and shaggy
    ulster soon looked like a drowned tomcat, I took a cab, at
    which he grumbled considerably, saying, &ldquo;What do I care
    about the opinion of all Amsterdam, I prefer walking; well,
    never mind, have it your own way.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In the museum he knew where to find what interested him
    most; he took me chiefly to the Van Goyens, the Bols and the
    Rembrandts; he spent the longest time in front of the
    <art id=jbride>&ldquo;Jewish Bride&rdquo;;</art> I could not tear him away from the
    spot; he went and sat down there at his ease, while I myself
    went on to look at some other things. &ldquo;You will find me
    here when you come back,&rdquo; he told me.</p>

    <p>When I came back after a pretty long while and asked him
    whether we should not get a move on, he gave me a surprised
    look and said, &ldquo;Would you believe it - and 1 honestly
    mean what I say - I should be happy to give ten years of my
    life if I could go on sitting here in front of this picture for
    a fortnight, with only a crust of dry bread for food?&rdquo; At
    last be got up. &ldquo;Well, never mind,&rdquo; he said,
    &ldquo;we can't stay here forever, can we?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>After that we went to Van Gogh's Fine Art Establishment,
    where at his recommendation I bought two books,
    <i>Mus&eacute;es de Hollande</i> and
    <i>Tr&eacute;sors d'art en Angleterre</i> by W. Burger
    (Thor&eacute;); when I asked him if he would go inside
    with me, he replied, &ldquo;No, I must not be seen on the
    premises of such a genteel, rich family.&rdquo; He still seemed
    to be on bad terms with his family; he remained standing in the
    street, waiting for me.</p>

    <p>Some time later we visited the museums at Antwerp, and I
    still remember one characteristic incident vividly. It was when
    he caught sight of the fisherboy carrying a basket on his back
    (I think it is by Vel&agrave;squez). Suddenly he
    disappeared from my side, and I saw him run to the picture; and
    of course I ran after him. When I reached him, he was standing
    in front of the picture with folded hands as if in devout
    prayer, and muttered, &ldquo;God&hellip;damn it, do you see
    that?&rdquo; After a while he said, &ldquo;That is what I call
    painting, look&rdquo; - and, following with his thumb the
    direction of the broad brush strokes - &ldquo;he was one to
    leave what he had once put down alone,&rdquo; and indicating
    the gallery with a wide, all-embracing gesture: &ldquo;All the
    rest belongs to the periwig-and-pigtail period.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He felt a deep veneration for Corot, Daubigny, Diaz, Millet,
    and further the whole Barbizon school, he was always full of
    it, and in his disquisitions on his beloved art he invariably
    reverted to them.</p>

    <p>However, he never spoke about art with totally uninitiated
    persons, and he was terribly annoyed when a so-called picture
    lover from his entourage told him that he thought a thing of
    his was beautiful; then he knew for certain, he was in the
    habit of saying, that it was bad, and as a rule such studies
    were destroyed or repainted. Only with a few chosen friends, to
    whom I also had the good fortune of belonging - although in
    those days these friends were also unable fully to agree with
    his manner of painting - did he like to talk about painting,
    drawing, etching and so on, and many a time I have reproached
    myself for not having understood him better at the time, for if
    I had, how much more might I have learned from him.</p>

    <p>He was always drawing comparisons between the art of
    painting and music, and in order to get an even better
    understanding of the values and the various nuances of the
    tones, he started taking piano lessons with an old music
    teacher who was at the same time an organist in Eindhoven.
    This, however, did not last long, for seeing that during the
    lessons Van Gogh was continually comparing the notes of the
    piano with Prussian blue and dark green and dark ochre, and so
    on, all the way to bright cadmium-yellow, the good man thought
    that he had to do with a madman, in consequence of which he
    became so afraid of him that he discontinued the lessons.</p>

    <p>I was also present at the painting of the water mill at
    Gestel, which picture I later saw again at Oldenzeel's and in
    the Boymans Museum at Rotterdam.</p>

    <p>At the time he thought he had found a means of preventing
    the, to him, so hateful, sinking in of the colours by using
    copaiba balsam, but seeing that he was rather lavish in the use
    of this ingredient, as he was of his colours too, he used too
    much of it, and the result was that the whole sky of the
    picture came floating down, so that he had to remove it with
    his palette knife, as may still be seen in the picture on close
    examination.</p>

    <p>Only a few pieces were signed by him. When I once asked him
    why he did not sign his name in full, he replied: &ldquo;Van
    Gogh is such an impossible name for many foreigners to
    pronounce; if it should happen that my pictures found their way
    to France or England, then the name would certainly be
    murdered, whereas the whole world can pronounce the name
    Vincent correctly.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He came to my house in Eindhoven very often. Once when I was
    sitting painting in my garden, I suddenly heard behind me:
    &ldquo;Look here, yes, you are right to paint in the open air;
    you should do it often...Yes, do you see the slant of that
    roof? It must be an angle of at least forty-five degrees; it's
    far too steep like that. And then I don't know how you are
    going to handle your colours, but all this is of no importance,
    just go ahead. There is nothing from which one learns so much
    as from painting in the open air. In particular you should
    compare the objects with each other, especially for the tone.
    Painting is like algebra: something is to this as that is to
    the other. And above all, study your perspective carefully; if
    you start by making things green in the background, how can you
    expect to get them green in the foreground?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Whenever he saw a beautiful evening sky, he went into
    ecstasies, if one may use the expression. Once, when we were
    tramping from Nuenen to Eindhoven toward evening, he suddenly
    stood stock-still before a glorious sunset, and using his two
    hands as if to screen it off a little, and with his eyes half
    closed, he exclaimed, &ldquo;God bless me, how does that
    fellow - or God, or whatever name you give him - how does he do
    it? We ought to be able to do that too. My God, my God, how
    beautiful that is! What a pity we haven't got a prepared
    palette ready, for it will be gone in a moment.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do let us sit down here for a minute. Take care you
    never forget to half-shut your eyes when you are painting in
    the open air. Once in a while those clodhoppers in Nuenen say
    that I am mad when they see me shuffling about over the moor,
    and stop, and crouch down in a half-sitting position, every now
    and then screwing my eyes half-shut, holding up my hands by my
    eyes, now in this way, now in that, in order to screen things
    off. But I don't give a damn about that, I just go my own
    way.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>For weeks on end he would occupy himself exclusively with
    the drawing of hands, feet or wooden shoes. &ldquo;That is
    something I must get a firm grip on,&rdquo; he used to say.</p>

    <p>One of the female models whom he used for painting studies
    of heads was his Dulcinea, according to village gossip. One
    repeatedly encounters her in his paintings of heads. It had
    even happened that this was objected to by one of the guardians
    of the villagers' salvation, and moreover, he blamed the same
    person for his having been given notice to quit his studio. As
    he himself recounted, he had taken singular vengeance after
    that, something that we shall cover with the cloak of charity,
    as being less suitable to record here.</p>

    <p>When he had finished his picture called &ldquo;The Potato
    Eaters,&rdquo; a picture done in very dark colours, with a
    hanging lamp over the table, around which a peasant family is
    sitting and eating steaming potatoes out of a dish, he carried
    it with him to Eindhoven to show me.</p>

    <p>Afterward he made a lithograph of this picture at a label
    factory; he made twenty prints of this lithograph, some of
    which may still be in existence. Mine, however, became
    hopelessly tattered later on, as it was printed on ordinary,
    inferior paper.</p>

    <p>Another time he came to me with the study of a woman
    spooling yarn; he had painted no spokes in the spooling wheel,
    but one continuous, unicoloured smear of transparent grey. This
    was such an extraordinary sight that I did not under stand it
    at first, and I asked him why he had done it in this way.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Don't you understand?&rdquo; he asked me. &ldquo;Once
    in a while the motion of the wheel is expressed this
    way.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He always spoke of Anton Mauve with the highest respect,
    although in the past he had been unable to get along with him,
    and had worked in his studio for only a short time. According
    to what he told me, Mauve once made a disapproving remark
    because he touched his canvas too often with his fingers while
    painting; this caused him to lose his temper, and he snapped at
    Mauve, &ldquo;What the hell does it matter, even if I did it
    with my heels, as long as it is good and has the right
    effect!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>For that matter this was a favorite expression of his;
    accordingly he used to say, Those little sheep have the right
    effect, or, That little birch tree might have a better effect,
    or, What a fine effect it has against that evening sky, and so
    on.</p>

    <p>He had already mentioned more than once that he wanted to go
    away, but I had never paid much attention to it, as I did not
    think he meant what he said, but at last he came to me and
    announced his departure for Antwerp, and after that to
    France.</p>

    <p>Before he set off he visited me once more to say good-by,
    and as a souvenir he brought me a beautiful autumn study, not
    yet entirely dry, finished completely in the open air, and
    measuring 3 ft. 4 in. by 2 ft. 8 in., and took away with him a
    little canvas as a souvenir in return.</p>

    <p>This autumn picture is still in my possession; it is painted
    in a very light range of colours, and the subject is very
    simple; in the foreground three gnarled oaks, still full of
    leaves, and one poor bare beggar of a pollard birch, in the
    background a tangled wilderness of various trees and shrubs,
    partly bare, shutting off the horizon, and in the centre the
    little figure of a woman in a white cap, just dashed off in
    three strokes of the brush, but having a beautiful effect, as
    he would have said himself.</p>

    <p>There is a striking atmosphere of autumn in this picture, it
    is painted in broad strokes, and the paint is richly laid on.
    When I remarked that he had not yet signed it, he said he might
    do so some time or other, &ldquo;I suppose I shall come back
    someday, but actually it isn't necessary; they will surely
    recognize my work later on, and write about me when I'm dead
    and gone. I shall take care of that, if I can keep alive for
    some little time.&rdquo;</p>
