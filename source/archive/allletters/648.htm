    <p>My dear Theo and dear Jo,</p>

    <p>Under ordinary circumstances I should certainly have hoped
    for a line from you these first few days.</p>

    <p>But considering how things have happened - my goodness - I
    think that Theo, Jo and the little one are a little on edge and
    are worn out - and besides, I myself am also far from having
    reached any kind of tranquillity.</p>

    <p>Often, very often I think of my little nephew - is he well?
    Jo, believe me - if ever you happen, as I hope, to have more
    children - don't get them in the city, have your confinement in
    the country and stay there until the child is three or four
    months old. At present it seems to me that while the child is
    still only 3 months old, your milk is already drying up,
    already - like Theo - you are too tired. I do not at all mean
    to say exhausted, by anyway worries are looming too large, and
    are too numerous, and you are sowing among thorns.</p>

    <p>That is why I would ask you to consider not going to
    Holland this year; the journey is always very, very expensive,
    and it never does any good. Yes, it will surely delight Mother,
    who will like to see the little one - but she will understand,
    and will prefer the well-being of the little one to the
    pleasure of seeing him.</p>

    <p>Besides, she would lose nothing, she will see him later. But
    - without daring to say that this is enough - however it may
    be, it is certainly preferable that father, mother and child
    should take a month of absolute rest in the country.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, I very much fear that I too was
    distressed, and I think it strange that I do not in the least
    know under what conditions I left - if it is at 150 francs a
    month paid in three installments, as before. Theo fixed nothing
    and so to begin with I left in confusion. Would there be a way
    of meeting each other again more calmly? I hope so, but I fear
    that the journey to Holland will be the last straw for all of
    us.</p>

    <p>I always foresee that the child will suffer later on for
    being brought up in the city. Does Jo think this exaggerated? I
    hope so, but anyway I think that one ought to be cautious all
    the same.</p>

    <p>And I say what I think, because you quite understand that I
    take an interest in my little nephew and am anxious for his
    well-being: since you were good enough to name him after me, I
    should like him to have a less troubled soul than mine, which is
    foundering.</p>

    <p>Now speaking about Dr. Gachet. I went to see him the day before
    yesterday, I did not find him in.</p>

    <p>Just now I am very well, I am working hard, have painted
    four studies and two drawings.</p>

    <p>You will see <art id=1624>a drawing of an old vineyard with the figure of
    a peasant woman</art>. I intend to make a big canvas of it.</p>

    <p>I think that we must not count on Dr. Gachet at all. First
    of all, he is sicker than I am, I think, or shall we say just
    as much, so that's that. Now when one blind man leads another
    blind man, don't they both fall into the ditch?</p>

    <p>I don't know what to say. Certainly my last attack, which
    was terrible, was in a large measure due to the influence of
    the other patients, and then the prison was crushing me, and
    old Peyron didn't pay the slightest attention, leaving me
    to vegetate with the rest, all deeply tainted.</p>

    <p>I can get a lodging, three small rooms at 150 fr. a year.
    That, if I find nothing better, and I hope to find a better
    one, is in any case preferable to the bedbug infested hole at
    Tanguy's, and besides, I should find a shelter for myself and
    could retouch the canvases that need it. So that the pictures
    will be less ruined, and by keeping them in good condition,
    there will be a greater chance of getting some profit out of
    them. For - I don't speak of my own - but the canvases by
    Bernard, Pr&eacute;vost, Russell, Guillaumin and Jeannin
    were going to ruin there, it is no place for them.</p>

    <p>Now canvases like these - again I do not speak of my own -
    are merchandise which has kept and keeps a certain value, and
    their neglect is one of the causes of our mutual penury.</p>

    <p>It makes me a little sad to have to insist that you send me
     at least a part of my monthly allowance from the beginning. But I
     will still do what I can so that all will go well.</p>

    <p>It is certain, I think, that we are all of us thinking of
    the little one, and that Jo says what she wants. Theo,
    like myself, will, I believe, arrange ourselves to her opinion. For myself,
    I can only say at the moment that I think we all need rest - I
    feel exhausted. So much for me - I feel that this is the lot
    which I accept and which will not change.</p>

    <p>But all the more reason, putting aside all ambition, we can live
    together for years without ruining each other. You see that
    with the canvases which are still at St. R&eacute;my,
    there are at least 8 with the 4 here, I am trying not to
    lose my skill. It is the absolute truth, however, that it is
    difficult to acquire a certain facility in production, and by
    ceasing to work, I shall lose it more quickly and more easily
    than the pains it has cost to acquire it. And the prospect
    grows darker, I see no happy future at all.</p>

    <p>Write me by return mail if you haven't already written, and
    good handshakes in thought. I would hope that there was a
    possibility of seeing each other again soon with more collected
    minds.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
