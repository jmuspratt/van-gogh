  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>That article by Herkomer interests me very much indeed; many
    thanks for it. My mind has been full of it since it came, and I
    hope I shall profit by what he says. <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>But I doubt whether his discourse will be generally
    understood. I'm afraid that he'll be misapprehended by most
    people, and that many will draw inferences from his words which
    he himself did not mean.</p>

    <p>What he says is in my opinion thoroughly apt and to the
    point and serious, but I repeat, one must have some knowledge
    of the matter - more than most - not to draw entirely false
    conclusions from his reasoning. Many might infer wrongly from
    what he says that he rejects and condemns the Americans and the
    school of Small, but this is not at all the case. He is
    speaking only of decadence - and not without cause.</p>

    <p>He points out that the merit of many wood engravings belongs
    mainly to the engraver and not to the artist. Thus, he argues,
    the powers of the artist are dwindling - an insufferable and
    disastrous state of affairs. I think this is perfectly true -
    for instance, compare that sheet of Ridley's, &ldquo;The
    Miners,&rdquo; which you say you found recently, with the
    full-page Types of Beauty that the Graphic published at a later
    date. Or take another sheet of Ridley's which I have, engraved
    soberly and austerely by Swain - &ldquo;The Children's Ward in
    a Hospital&rdquo; - there I feel the justification for what
    I've heard people who are supposed to be first-rate
    connoisseurs contemptuously refer to in these terms, &ldquo;Oh
    well, that's the old-fashioned style.&rdquo; And then we
    remember what Herkomer wanted to say - that old style of
    engraving, that elaborate, honest, unembellished drawing, is by
    far the best.</p>

    <p>Herkomer says, Take care lest it be lost. When art has lost
    it, then art will have spinal meningitis or consumption. Yet I
    don't believe he condemns Small himself, for instance, or Chr.
    Green and others - I know reproductions of drawings by
    Herkomer, e.g. the &ldquo;Bavarian Sketches,&rdquo; which are
    done in the same style.</p>

    <p>But Herkomer will not disapprove of Caton Woodville's
    &ldquo;The Distribution of Peat Tickets in Ireland&rdquo; or
    Howard Pyle's &ldquo;Xmas in Olden Times,&rdquo; although Caton
    Woodville and H. Pyle have both worked for a newer style of
    illustration, and have overstepped &ldquo;<i>the
    marginline</i>.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>As regards this C. Woodville, I am sorry that he has done
    those enormously large military things, however clever they may
    be; and I prefer his sheets in the style of &ldquo;The Peat
    Market.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>That diatribe against Harper's and the Americans, moreover,
    reminds me of Charles Dickens, who denounced them too - see
    Chuzzlewit<i>,</i> etc. - but later on, when he saw that people
    were misinterpreting his words, as if he thought nothing
    American could be good, he inserted a preface in the later
    editions of Chuzzlewit in which he reveals his other
    impressions of America and his experiences on a second trip
    there. Look at Forster's Life of Charles Dickens<i>,</i> if you
    have it, and you will see more clearly what I mean.</p>

    <p>So with regard to the Americans and the wood engravers of
    the present day, let us not judge prematurely, and let us
    remember the old saying, &ldquo;Beware of pulling out the good
    wheat along with the chaff.&rdquo; The reproaches he directs
    against the Graphic and against publishers in general are not
    uncalled for, as a matter of fact. I abhor words like
    &ldquo;pleasing&rdquo; and &ldquo;saleable&rdquo; - they are as
    bad as the plague - yet I've never met a dealer who wasn't
    saturated with them. Art has no worse enemies, despite the fact
    that the managers of the big art-dealing establishments
    reputedly deserve high praise for their protection of
    artists.</p>

    <p>They don't do the right thing - yet because the public turns
    to them and not to the artists themselves, the latter are
    forced to turn to them too - but there isn't a single artist
    who does not resent them, openly or secretly. They flatter the
    public, encouraging its worst, most barbaric inclinations and
    taste. But enough of this! The conclusion that you and I should
    draw from H. H.'s reasoning is, Draw austerely, be serious, be
    honest.</p>

    <p>Listen, this last letter of yours, and the impression that
    H. H.'s energetic words made on you as well as me, make me wish
    all the more that we could see more of each other's work.</p>

    <p>At that last splendid exhibition of &ldquo;Pictura&rdquo; I
    was struck by the fact that, although Isra&euml;ls, Mauve,
    Mans, Neuhuys, Weissenbruch and many others have remained
    themselves, one sees signs of decadence among their followers
    too, and no indication of progress - at least, if one does not
    look at them individually but rather compares them with an
    exhibition of that bygone era when the artists who are
    prominent today were the &ldquo;rising men.&rdquo; Those
    &ldquo;rising men&rdquo; of today are not what the
    &ldquo;rising men&rdquo; of the previous generation were - more
    effect and less quality nowadays. I have written about this
    more than once. I also see a difference between the
    personalities of the respective &ldquo;rising men.&rdquo; You
    know yourself, and you yourself suffer under it, that they look
    upon you and me as unpleasant, quarrelsome nonentities, and
    that above all they consider us ponderous and boring in our
    work and in our persons.</p>

    <p>And believe me - whoever has seen the prominent artists of
    today ten years ago, both as men and as artists, when all of
    them were much poorer - they have made an enormous amount of
    money these last ten years - regrets those days ten years
    ago.</p>

    <p>Which induces me to repeat my congratulations for your
    having been refused by Arti. If you made a great hit under the
    present circumstances, I should feel less respect and sympathy
    for you than I do now. I certainly see very clearly that you
    and I will undoubtedly produce much better work than we do now,
    and that our present work is not bad. Our attitude toward
    ourselves must remain stern, and we must be energetic, but
    there isn't a single reason why we should let ourselves be
    discouraged or put out by what is said of our work by people
    who believe they know a better style than the one we have
    adopted, namely drawing, or trying to draw, what strikes us in
    domestic life, in the street, or in a hospital, etc. If you
    knew, for instance, what De Groux has suffered from criticism
    and ill will, it would stagger you. We must not have any
    illusions about ourselves, but be prepared to be misunderstood,
    despised and slandered, and yet - even if things become worse
    than they are now - we shall have to keep up our courage and
    enthusiasm. I believe it would be a good thing for us to focus
    our attention on the men and works of former days, say some
    twenty or thirty years ago, as otherwise it will be justly said
    of us afterward, &ldquo;Rappard and Vincent may also be
    reckoned among the decadent fellows.&rdquo; This is a harsh
    dictum, but I mean every bit of it, and I shall go my own way
    without paying much attention to the present school.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
