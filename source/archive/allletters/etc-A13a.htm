    <p>[From Investigations about Vincent van Gogh in Brabant by
    Benno J. Stokvis, Lld., 1926.]</p>

    <p>VISIT TO BREDA</p>

    <p>Although the town of Breda never played a part of paramount
    importance in Vincent van Gogh's life, it possesses special
    importance for the historian because it is one of the best
    places to find works proceeding from the hand of the
    artist.</p>

    <p>This consideration induced me to go to Breda first of all.
    An introductory observation is indispensable, however. During
    the years 1884 and 1885 Vincent had his studio in the house of
    the sexton of the Roman Catholic church for some time. When at
    last there arose a difference of opinion between the priest and
    the painter, the latter went away to Antwerp, leaving behind
    almost completely the voluminous collection of his work in the
    studio. The Rev. Mr. Van Gogh had died more than half a year
    before. Old Mrs. Van Gogh went on living at the parsonage for
    the time being, but at last decided to move to another place
    along with her daughter Wilhelmina. Vincent's work, which had
    remained in the house of the sexton all the time, was packed
    into cases and entrusted to the care of a carpenter at Breda
    along with a great part of the family's furniture. Mrs. Van
    Gogh-Bonger states that in the course of time the cases which
    were in the house of the carpenter were simply forgotten, and
    that the latter later sold them to a secondhand dealer, after
    which they disappeared. <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>In the first place it was my intention to make a search for
    the secondhand dealer who had got hold of the work. I knew that
    the carpenter (Schrauer) had long ceased to belong to the realm
    of the living. All that I had been able to find out about this
    secondhand dealer was that he had a
    &ldquo;French-sounding&rdquo; name.</p>

    <p>The task did not seem easy. However, Breda is a small town,
    and in small towns people know a lot, and moreover it happened
    to be &ldquo;kermis&rdquo; (fair time), so that it may be
    presumed that people were more communicative than they would
    have been in a period which was not kermis. I was very soon
    informed that there are, in the vicinity of the Great Church
    [Grote Kerk], secondhand shops which have been handed down from
    parent to child. And when a short time later I trod the
    pavement of Hal Street, and soon descried on my right a shop
    with the requisite qualifications, and asked a cautious
    introductory question, I immediately discovered to my joy that
    I had found the right man. Indeed, Mr. Couvreur and his brother
    J. C. Couvreur had done business with Vincent's work at the
    time. Of the information both gentlemen imparted to me with the
    greatest alacrity, I here give the following particulars.</p>

    <p>After the Van Gogh family had had the furniture bought back
    from Schrauer, the cases remained at the latter's house for a
    great number of years, as it were without an owner.</p>

    <p>It would seem that at last Schrauer, who had come to look
    upon himself as the owner, broke everything open, and took the
    portfolios full of drawings, sketches and watercolours, as well
    as the painted canvases - either put on stretchers or not - out
    of the cases, after which he used the wood for practical
    purposes. It is a certain fact that the Couvreur brothers found
    only loose portfolios of drawings and painted pictures.</p>

    <p>One day in the year 1903, J. C. Couvreur went to the house
    of Schrauer the carpenter in order to buy some old brasswork,
    such as little kettles and the like. After some haggling
    Schrauer agreed to part with the whole lot for one rijksdaalder
    [i.e., one dollar or four shillings and fourpence!], but being
    suddenly reminded of something he added, pointing to a corner
    in which Van Gogh's work was lying in a pile, &ldquo;But then
    you will have to take away this lot of rubbish too.&rdquo; This
    happened. Schrauer did not receive one single cent for the
    &ldquo;lot of rubbish.&rdquo; This came to light in the course
    of the legal proceedings following an action brought against
    him by the painter's family.</p>

    <p>Couvreur bought home a cart piled high with Van Gogh works,
    and the whole lot was stored in the cellar for the time being.
    About a hundred crayon drawings, looked upon as having no
    value, were torn up on the spot and thrown away. After this
    some larger canvases were sold to a rag shop, and went to
    &ldquo;the works&rdquo; at Tilberg to be scientifically
    destroyed. It is possible that some workman took one of these
    pictures home &ldquo;for fun.&rdquo; Couvreur's wife objected
    to her husband's keeping drawings from the nude about the
    house, and so these were thrown away.</p>

    <p>In those days some dealers from Rotterdam called on
    Couvreur; he showed them his new acquisitions, but those men
    told him that &ldquo;there was nothing in it,&rdquo; and that
    the value was nil. This was one of the reasons why Couvreur
    paid so little attention at first to Schrauer's present. At
    long last he nailed some of the canvases to his pushcart,
    filled it with drawings, and sallied forth to try to sell them
    in the bargain market. He sold them, according to size and
    &ldquo;prettiness,&rdquo; for a penny or twopence apiece, some
    even went three for twopence, drawings and little paintings
    thrown together. Many farmers and farmer's wives bought
    something. Finally there came along a certain gentleman
    (Mouwen) who bought all that remained on the cart for
    <i>one</i> guilder [40 cents or about one shilling, seven pence
    halfpenny].</p>

    <p>These is a remarkable coincidence in this with a story I
    once heard as a boy which made a great impression on me. It was
    told that some man, a hawker, was wandering about the streets
    of a small Brabant town with a pushcart full of Van Goghs; a
    gentleman had bought the whole lot out of pity; later on the
    well-known H. P. Bremmer <sup>2</sup> happened to see the
    collection and made important purchases in behalf of the
    Kr&Atilde;&para;ller collection (then private), for Hidde
    Nijland <sup>3</sup> and himself. I have a very strong
    suspicion that the persons called the hawker and the gentleman
    in this story are identical with Couvreur and Mouwen.</p>

    <p>At the behest of Mr. Mouwen, who saw the promise of much
    profit in this affair, the Couvreur brothers later called on
    the persons to whom they remembered having sold drawings, for
    the purpose of buying back as many as possible, but this did
    not prove too easy - the news of the value these pieces were
    said to have had penetrated everywhere; for some of them, which
    had been cheerfully sold for twopence, the Couvreur brothers
    counted down 100 guilders!</p>

    <p>The paintings which they had kept in their possession the
    sold successively to Mr. Mouwen, the last one for 90 guilders;
    it was a trick of fate that on the very next day J. Couvreur
    happened to read in the <i>Nieuwe</i> <i>Rotterdamse
    Courant</i> an elaborate article on the famous painter Vincent
    van Gogh. Of his former stock there then remained not one piece
    in his possession; a few weeks later he discovered that the
    canvas, the sale of which for less than 100 he had supposed to
    be a highly profitable bit of business, had been put down in
    the records of a public auction as having been sold for 4,000
    guilders.</p>

    <p>In those days, when all these happenings had become general
    knowledge, a veritable Van Gogh rage broke out in Brabant;
    people everywhere thought they had discovered new work by the
    painter. It seems that in consequence of this a number of
    falsifications were produced. I may state that in this
    connection I heard the name of a rather well-known painter,
    whose work so strongly resembled Vincent's paintings in this
    period that some dealers snapped up everything he produced,
    obliterated his signature without his knowledge (much of Van
    Gogh's work is unsigned), or altered it, and presented the
    pictures to the world in this way. According to Mr. Couvreur, a
    connoisseur can always easily recognize a real Van Gogh
    drawing, for &ldquo;they are all of them little straight lines,
    and yet it is round&rdquo;; both brothers agree on the
    particular that the majority of Vincent's works were
    characterized by a peculiar smell.</p>

    <p>In reply to my question as to the number of pieces of the
    various kinds of Van Gogh's work which the Couvreur brothers
    had had in their possession, they mentioned a rough estimate
    of: 60 paintings on stretchers, 150 loose canvases, two
    portfolios with approximately 90 pen drawings, and some 100 or
    200 crayon drawings.</p>

    <p>The following historical anecdotes were confided to me.</p>

    <p>Shortly after the work had come into his possession,
    Couvreur made a friend of his, an innkeeper in Ginneken Street,
    Breda, a present of a number of drawings and little paintings.
    Visitors who drank a more or less considerable number of
    glasses of beer then got one of these pieces as a souvenir. One
    of this innkeeper's waiters bought a loose canvas for a few
    &ldquo;dubbeltjes,&rdquo; and took it with him when he went to
    Antwerp. When later the great value of these pieces came to
    light, Couvreur went in search of this waiter. He discovered
    that the man had pasted the picture onto the door of his little
    attic, and this so efficaciously that taking it off proved to
    be impossible without damaging it; so the corresponding part of
    the door was sawed out, and later the precious discovery was
    carefully separated from the wood.</p>

    <p>Another story runs as follows. Carpenter Schrauer had given
    a batch of thirteen canvases on stretchers to a lady of his
    acquaintance. She had used them to repair the holes in the
    walls of her summer house by the simple expedient of nailing
    them over these holes. So the pictures were exposed to wind and
    weather. Couvreur got hold of the collection at a price of 100
    guilders, and sold it to Mouwen for 300 guilders.</p>

    <p>Some years after all this had happened, Couvreur bought all
    the furniture of a house somewhere outside Breda. Among the
    goods there was a small iron hearth plate to which the son of
    the seller seemed to attach some sentimental value. Therefore
    he proposed to exchange it for a number of drawings he still
    had in his possession. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Couvreur said,
    &ldquo;if you hand over another fourpence.&rdquo; It appeared
    that the drawings were six Van Goghs, which were later sold for
    180 guilders.</p>

    <p>Finally I put the question, &ldquo;Do you happen to remember
    what some of the pictures represented?&rdquo; Two of them had
    stuck in Mr. Couvreur's memory: one was the picture of a rural
    wedding party in an inner room, around the table, under a lamp
    which poured down a fierce light, a number of peasants,
    standing with glasses in their hands; the other one was a
    winter scene, an ox before a wagon on a field, desolate, and
    with crows.</p>

    <p>It appeared further that no members of the painter's family
    were living either at Breda or at Prinsenhage (where at the
    time an uncle of Vincent's and later also his mother
    lived).</p>

        <p>[Note by Dr. Stokvis] According to a correction which I
        received from a well-informed person of the assertion that
        these cases were forgotten through neglect, let it be
        mentioned here incidentally that there was really no
        question of this. In fact, when the furniture was brought
        back from the carpenter, one of the painter's younger
        sisters investigated the cases in which his work was
        stored, and found in them traces of woodworm. Vincent's
        mother, being afraid of &ldquo;infection,&rdquo; thereupon
        decided to leave everything in the place and in the state
        it was. Everyone is at liberty to see I this a striking
        example of the respect and understanding Van Gogh's nearest
        relatives showed with reference to his work!</p>
