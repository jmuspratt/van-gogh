  <body>
    <p>My dear comrade Bernard,</p>

    <p>This time you deserve higher praise for the little sketch of
    the two Breton women in your letter than for the other six,
    because the little one has great style. I myself am behindhand
    with the sketches, for during the present superbly fine days I
    have been completely absorbed in square size 30 canvases which
    exhaust me considerably, and which I shall use to decorate the
    house. You will have received my letter in which I explained my
    serious reasons for advising you to try to persuade your
    father, if he pays your fare to Arles, to give you a little
    more latitude in the matter of finances.</p>

    <p>I believe you will pay him back with your work, and in this
    way you would be in Gauguin's company longer; and then, when
    you leave to do your military service, you would set out on a
    fine artistic campaign. If your father had a son who sought and
    found unrefined gold in the pebbles and on the sidewalks, he
    would certainly not despise that talent. Now in my opinion your
    talent is absolutely equivalent to that.</p>

    <p>Though your father might regret that it is not quite new and
    shining gold, coined into louis d'or, yet he would decide to
    make a collection of these finds, and would not part with them
    except for a reasonable price.</p>

    <p>He ought to do the same thing with your pictures and
    drawings, which are, commercially speaking, as rare and
    valuable as precious stones and rare metals. And that is
    absolutely true.</p>

    <p>Painting a picture is as difficult as finding a large or a
    small diamond. Now, however, whereas everybody recognizes the
    value of a louis d'or or a pure pearl, those who cherish
    pictures and believe in them are unfortunately rare. But they
    exist nonetheless.</p>

    <p>In any ease one cannot do better than wait without losing
    patience, even if one should have to wait a very long time.</p>

    <p>As for you, just think over what I told you about the cost
    of living here, and whether you would really like to come to
    Arles to join Gauguin and me. Tell your father emphatically
    that with a little more money you would paint much better
    pictures.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">The idea of turning the painters into a sort of freemasonry
    does not please me enormously. I profoundly despise
    regulations, institutions, etc.; in short, what I am looking
    for is different from dogmas, which, far from settling things,
    only give rise to endless disputes. It is all a sign of
    decadence. Since a union of painters does not exist yet -
    except as a vague but very comprehensive design - well let's
    wait quietly and see what will happen that must happen.</p>

    <p>It will be a finer thing if all this crystallizes naturally;
    the more one talks about it the less it will happen. If you
    want to help it onward, you will only have to go on working
    with Gauguin and me. This is in progress, so don't let's talk
    about it. If it is to come about, it will happen without prolix
    discussions but as the result of calm, well-thought-out
    actions.</label></p>

    <p>As for exchanges, it is just because I observe that in the
    [i.e. your and Gauguin's] letters such frequent mention is made
    of Laval, Moret and the other young man that I am anxious to
    make their acquaintance. But I don't have five dry studies; I
    shall have to add at least two attempts at pictures a little
    more serious: a self-portrait and a landscape during the fury
    of an evil-minded mistral.</p>

    <p>Moreover I should have <art id=430>a study of a little garden with
    multicolored flowers</art>, <art id=0477>a study of grey and dusty thistles</art>, and
    finally a still life of <art id=0461>a peasant's old boots</art>, last of all
    a little landscape of nothing at all, in which there is only a little expanse. If
    these studies are not to their liking, if one or the other
    would rather not have them, then the only thing to do is to
    keep those for which they want to make an exchange, and to send
    back the others together with the exchanges. There is no hurry,
    and when making exchanges it is better for each to try to give
    something good.</p>

    <p>If, when it is exposed tomorrow to the sun, it gets
    sufficiently dry to be rolled up, I shall add a landscape of
    <art id=0449>&ldquo;Men Unloading Sand,&rdquo;</art> also a project for and an
    attempt at a picture, in which there is a more mature
    purposefulness.</p>

    <p>I cannot send a replica of the &ldquo;Night
    Caf&eacute;&rdquo; yet because it has not even been begun, but
    I shall be delighted to do one for you.</p>

    <p>Once more, it is preferable for each of us to try to
    exchange good things, rather than do them in too great a
    hurry.</p>

    <p>The artistic gentleman in the letter, <sup>1</sup> who looks
    like me - is it me or somebody else? - as far as the face is
    concerned it would really seem to be me, but in the first place
    I am always smoking a pipe,<label content="psychology.neurological"> and then I have always had an
    unutterable horror of sitting like that on precipitous cliffs
    verging on the sea, as I suffer from vertigo. </label>So if that is
    meant to be my portrait, I protest against the aforementioned
    improbabilities.</p>

    <p>1 am terribly absorbed in decorating my house; I dare
    believe it will be rather to your taste, although it is
    certainly very different from what you do. But at the time, you
    spoke to me about pictures, one representing flowers, another
    trees, another fields. Well, I myself have the<art id=0468> &ldquo;Poet's
    Garden&rdquo;</art> (2 canvases; among the sketches you have <art id=1450>there is
    the first conception of it</art>, done after <art id=0428>a smaller study that is
    already at my brother's)</art>. Then the<art id=0474> &ldquo;Starry Night,&rdquo;</art>
    further <art id=0475>the &ldquo;Vineyard,&rdquo;</art> then <art id=0574>the &ldquo;`Furrows,&rdquo;</art>
    then <art id=0464>the view of the house, which might be called &ldquo;The
    Street.&rdquo;</art> So that there is a certain unintentional
    consecutiveness.</p>

    <p>Well, I am very curious to see the studies of Pont-Aven.
    But, as for you, please give me something a little elaborate.
    Anyhow, it is sure to be all right, because I like your talent
    so much that I greatly want to make a little collection of your
    works, bit by bit.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">For a long time I have thought it touching that the Japanese
    artists used to exchange works among themselves very often. It
    certainly proves that they liked and upheld each other, and
    that there reigned a certain harmony among them; and that they
    were really living in some sort of fraternal community, quite
    naturally, and not in intrigues. The more we are like them in
    this respect, the better it will be for us. It also appears
    that the Japanese earned very little money, and lived like
    simple workmen.</label> I have the reproduction (published by Bing),
    &ldquo;A Single Blade of Grass.&rdquo; What an example of
    conscientiousness! You will see it someday. A hearty
    handshake.</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Vincent</p>
