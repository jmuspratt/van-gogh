  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>I just received your letter, many thanks for it.</p>

    <p>I will tell you a few more of my experiences here. In the
    first place, I had a letter from Rappard from West
    Terschelling, and he is very hard at work there, first having
    been here in Drenthe at Rolde, in the neighbourhood of Assen. I
    hope to go and see him there this winter, and make a few
    studies - unless it is difficult to cross to Terschelling; as
    far as I can make out, the journey there and back will cost
    about 3 guilders.</p>

    <p>But it is certainly worth that much to be with a painter
    again, and it will break my solitude.</p>

    <p>I long very much for your next letter, which I hope will
    come soon. Do not forget to tell me the result of your approach
    to C. M., whether you have told him I was here and if that
    letter also remained unanswered.</p>

    <p>If so, I shall most certainly go and call on C. M. someday -
    not now, of course - to ask him to explain why he didn't
    answer. I will not write to him, but I am firmly resolved not
    to put up with his not answering, especially not answering
    <i>you</i>, and in addition, his not answering <i>me</i>.</p>

    <p>I have never pretended that he was obliged to do something,
    nor do I now. I consider what he did or might do a favour, for
    which I have always thanked him; and for my part, I have given
    him studies for it, at least fifty in all, with the right to
    exchange them later.</p>

    <p>This being so, I certainly need not put up with insults, and
    it is a decided insult that he did not acknowledge the receipt
    of the past packages of studies. Not a syllable.</p>

    <p>And if it should happen that <i>your</i> letter remains
    unanswered too, then it would be cowardly to let the matter
    rest, and in that case I shall and <i>must</i> demand an
    explanation, and, as I said, even if I have to postpone it for
    some time, I shall do so very resolutely and by means of a
    personal visit. I would certainly not drop the matter in case
    he should be unwilling to receive me, for I am firmly resolved
    to get satisfaction. If he is willing to give it, all right
    then; but if he should refuse (I did not make use of a single
    discourteous expression in addressing him, I only wrote in a
    very cool vein), <i>if</i> he should refuse, then I shall tell
    him to give me - and I <i>have a right</i> to tell him so - an
    eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, and then in my turn I
    shall insult him without restraint, quite cold-bloodedly.</p>

    <p>Listen well, brother, understand this once and for all -
    however desirable it may be to get some financial help, this is
    far from being the principal thing. The principal thing is that
    he goes too far in losing sight of my rights as a human being.
    Even if I were a stranger (I never mention our relationship, I
    never count on that), I could not endure being treated as a
    reprobate, being judged or accused of things without being
    heard myself. I have the right, <i>the full right</i>, to
    <i>demand</i> an answer, and I must take it as a gross insult
    if he remains silent.</p>

    <p>I must speak about this without reserve, seeing that until
    now I had thought matters would come out right of their own
    accord, and I should receive a few words in reply. But this
    suffering in silence has its limits, and, as I said, beyond
    these limits it would be cowardly and unmanly of me not to make
    a stern protest.</p>

    <p>So I beg you simply to tell me the result of your letter,
    then I shall know for myself what to do. I will not say another
    word about it, and even if more than a year passes over it, I
    will retain - just as untarnished, clear and bright as at this
    moment - the same conviction that I must have an explanation,
    and I will not rest before I have settled this matter with him
    in some way or other.</p>

    <p>I believe you will approve of this feeling, even more so if
    you knew exactly what happened between him and me years ago,
    when I was very skeptical about the plan of studying, whether
    the promise to carry it through was sincere and well
    considered. I then thought that they had made the plan rashly
    and that I had approved of it rashly. And in my opinion it
    always remains an excellent thing that a stop was put to it
    then, which I brought about on purpose and arranged so that the
    shame of giving it up fell on me, and on nobody else. You
    understand that I, who have learned other languages, might have
    managed also to master that miserable little bit of Latin -
    which I declared, however, to be too much for me.<label content="attitude.clergy"> This was a
    blind, because I then preferred not to explain to my protectors
    that the whole university, the theological faculty at least,
    is, in my eyes, an inexpressible mess, a breeding place of
    Pharisaism.</label></p>

    <p>That I did not lack courage, I tried to prove by going to
    the Borinage, where life was certainly much harder than it
    would have been for me if I had become a student.</p>

    <p>I thought that C. M., for instance, might have understood me
    better, and I have all the more reason to think him
    inconsiderate when I think how he has treated me with a certain
    suspicion since then. <i>Then</i> and <i>now</i> I have kept
    back a lot of things I might have said, but when the time comes
    for me to attack him, he will feel in his conscience, whatever
    he may say, that neither in the past nor at present have I ever
    committed a base action towards him, so that there are no
    reasonable grounds for this insult of not answering. The more
    so as it would have been better if, from the moment I went to
    The Hague, we had let bygones be bygones, and all had been
    forgiven and forgotten, and we had decided to be on good terms
    with each other, as I told His Honour at the time. But,
    brother, I do <i>not</i> say peace <i>at any price</i>, and I
    prefer an unpleasant explanation to a poor-spirited letting
    things slide, whenever this would really be poor-spirited.</p>

    <p>But be assured that I shall not mention you, although it is
    a fact that if he will not undo his insulting you (I have the
    impression he is inaugurating the same policy toward you), it
    makes my resolve to have it out with His Honour inexorable, and
    it is my firm intention to tell him a lot of home truths. Only
    I promise you that I shall seem to be speaking for myself
    alone, as if I did not know anything about you.</p>

    <p>I have the deepest contempt for this mysterious, sphynxlike
    silence, and I hereby declare to you, I find it anything but
    straight and honest or upright. It may be like the general
    politics of the present day, I know that very well, but you
    know that I don't agree with the general politics of the
    present day, because I consider them mean and carrying all the
    signs of decadence which will lead to a regular periwig and
    pigtail period! One might almost weep over what is now spoiled
    on every side; what our predecessors gave their honest labour
    to is now neglected and abandoned in a cowardly way. The time
    we live in is perhaps outwardly a little more respectable than
    the one that is past, but the nobleness is disappearing too
    fast, so that one no longer expects from the future the same
    great things which they did in the past. Well, everybody must
    find his own way.</p>

    <p>Now, to change the subject (but it was necessary to deal
    with this matter, though I do not like writing about it in the
    slightest), I come back to my experiences here. The more I walk
    around here, the better I like Hoogeveen, and I do not doubt
    that it will remain so.</p>

    <p>Even without C. M.'s help. And I am afraid this will be the
    case, in the long run it will be cheaper here than in The
    Hague. But without C. M.'s help, I shall have to stint myself
    for a certain time before I can carry out my plans. And
    perhaps, after all, nothing will be lost by it.</p>

    <p>But the fact is that I need money, and a supply of colours
    and various other things, before I can expect any good results
    from a ramble through the southeast corner of Drenthe.</p>

    <p>But in six months, for instance, I hope to have saved up
    enough, and in the meantime I shall be able to make some things
    here. So for the present I will not go farther, but stay here
    and work in the neighbourhood. I will try to save some money
    for two trips, one to the southeast district, one through the
    moors between here and Assen. And I hope to combine the visit
    to friend Rappard with the latter excursion northward, and to
    stay awhile in Terschelling, at his inn called &ldquo;The
    Shiplet.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It would be too reckless to undertake these two excursions
    if one did so without a stock of materials and without taking
    the necessary precautions. But with patience they will be
    possible, for I see clearly enough that I have fewer expenses
    here than in The Hague. And before undertaking them, I want to
    pay back Rappard, though it may be that later I shall borrow
    some more from him after having seen him, and when I know for
    sure that it will help me make something in particular.</p>

    <p>At first I had some bad luck with my models on the heath;
    they laughed at me, and made fun of me, and I could not finish
    some studies of the figure I had started because of the
    unwillingness of the models, notwithstanding that I had paid
    them well, at least by local standards.</p>

    <p>However, I did not give up, and on that same spot I
    concentrated on one single family, from which I can now have an
    old woman, a girl, and a man, and I hope they will remain
    willing. I have made a few studies of the heath which I shall
    send you when they are dry, and I have also started a few
    watercolours. And I began some pen drawings too, just with a
    view to painting, because with the pen one can enter into such
    details as are impossible in painted studies, and it is
    advisable to make two studies, one solely drawn for the
    composition and one painted for the colour. That is to say, if
    it is possible and circumstances permit, this is the way to put
    vigour into the painted studies later on.</p>

    <p>The heath is splendid, and there are marshy meadows that
    often remind me of Th. Rousseau.</p>

    <p>Well, I can tell you that the country air and life here are
    doing me a lot of good. <label content="feelings.guilt">Oh, if only the poor woman could have
    enjoyed it too. I think of her with such tender regret - though
    my common sense tells me clearly that it is impossible under
    the circumstances.</label></p>

    <p>I am worried about her because I have not heard anything,
    and must conclude that either she did not want or was not able
    to do the things I advised her to do. I can hardly even write
    to her, because in the first place, as long as she continues to
    live in Bagijnestraat, I know that my letter will probably be
    opened by her brother or her mother; and in the second place,
    as long as she lives there, I do not <i>want</i> to have
    anything to do with them, <i>not even with her</i>. Well,
    perhaps I may hear something yet, but if not, it will give me a
    melancholy feeling. I had hoped to have news from an address
    other than Bagijnestraat, namely that she had started a small
    laundry with her mother.</p>

    <p>Oh, Theo, if she hadn't had any family, she would have
    behaved so much better. Women of her kind are certainly bad,
    but in the first place they are infinitely - oh, infinitely
    more to be pitied than condemned; and in the second place they
    have a certain passion, a certain warmth, which is so truly
    human that the virtuous people might take them as an example,
    and I for my part understand Jesus's words when He said to the
    superficially civilized, the respectable people of His time,
    &ldquo;The harlots go into the Kingdom of God before
    you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Women like her can be thoroughly bad (I do not speak here of
    the Nanas, hot blooded and voluptuous, but of the more nervous,
    reflective temperaments among them), women like her quite
    justify Proudhon's saying, &ldquo;La femme est la
    d&eacute;solation du juste&rdquo; [Woman is the desolation of
    the just]; they do not care at all for what we call reason, and
    they act straightway and wickedly against it. I know that, but
    on the other hand they have that truly human feeling, so that
    one cannot but like them and cannot but spare them, and it
    makes one feel there is some good in them, a something very
    good even though one cannot define it otherwise than as a
    &ldquo;je ne sais quoi qui fait qu'on les aime apr&egrave;s
    tout&rdquo; [I don't know what makes one like them after
    all].</p>

    <p>Gavarni was quite serious when he said, &ldquo;Avec chacune
    que j'ai quitt&eacute;e, j'ai senti quelque chose se mourir en
    moi.&rdquo; [With every one of them whom I have left I felt
    something die within me.] And the most beautiful saying and the
    <i>best</i> I know about women is the one you also know,
    &ldquo;O femme que <i>j'aurais</i> aim&eacute;e&rdquo; [O woman
    whom I <i>might</i> have loved], and one should like to enter
    eternity with it - without wanting to know any more about it
    than that. I know that there are women absurd enough to be
    entirely governed by ambition (they do even more harm with it
    than men). Lady Macbeth is the archetype of such; these women
    are dangerous, and notwithstanding their charm, one must avoid
    them, or one becomes a scoundrel, and in a short time finds
    oneself face to face with a terrible evil one has committed and
    can never repair. But that was not the case with the one whom I
    was with, though she was vain, as we all are at times; the only
    thing I felt in the beginning was, Poor, poor, poor creature,
    and I still feel it at the end. Bad? que soit? but who is there
    that is good in these times? What man feels himself so pure
    that he can set himself to judge? Far from it. Delacroix would
    have understood her, I say, and I sometimes think God's mercy
    will understand her even better.</p>

    <p>As I told you, the little boy was very fond of me, and when
    I was already on the train, I still had him on my lap. And so I
    think we parted from both sides with inexpressible sadness, but
    not more than that.</p>

    <p>I tell you, brother, I am not good from a clergyman's point
    of view. I know full well that, frankly speaking, prostitutes
    are bad, but I feel something human in them which prevents me
    from feeling the slightest scruple about associating with them;
    I see nothing very wrong in them. I haven't the slightest
    regret about any past or present association with them. If our
    society were pure and well regulated, yes, then they would be
    seducers; but now, in my opinion, one may often consider them
    more as sisters of charity.</p>

    <p>And <i>now</i>, as in other periods when civilization is in
    a decline, the corruption of society has turned all the
    relations of good and evil upside down, and one falls back
    logically upon the old saying, &ldquo;The first shall be last,
    and the last shall be first.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Like you, I have visited &ldquo;P&egrave;re Lachaise.&rdquo;
    I have seen there graves of marble, for which I have an
    indescribable respect.<label content="attitude.women"> I feel the same respect before the
    humble tombstone of B&eacute;ranger's mistress, which I looked
    for on purpose (if I remember correctly, it is in a corner
    behind his own), and there I particularly remembered Corot's
    mistress too. Silent muses these women were, and in the emotion
    of those gentle masters, in the intimacy, the pathos of their
    poetry, I always feel a woman's influence everywhere.</label></p>

    <p>I am speaking rather seriously in this letter, not because I
    think Father's feelings and opinion wrong in everything - far
    from it; in many things you will do well to follow Father's
    advice. We spoke about Father during your visit here, as you
    will remember, and also at the moment of your departure - but I
    can now express in clear terms what I felt only vaguely at the
    time: <i>If</i> you speak with Father, then think of Corot at
    the same time; then you will be able to avoid certain extremes,
    to which Father is far too much inclined; but as I see it,
    provided there is less inflexibility, Father's advice is
    generally sound, and I myself have taken it more than once. But
    I just want to point out that Father and many others <i>do not
    know</i> that besides their own righteous lives - for Father's
    life is righteous - there are other righteous lives in a milder
    spirit, like Corot's, B&eacute;ranger's, for instance. At all
    events you, and I too, feel this more strongly. Because Father
    and others <i>do not know this</i>, they are often hopelessly
    mistaken in their judgement of certain things, mistakes of the
    kind that, for instance, C. M. makes, who feels sure that De
    Groux is a bad man, in which, however sure he may be of it, he
    is mistaken.</p>

    <p>I will tell you another thing now, to prove to you that I am
    not speaking abstractly, but about things of foundation and
    substance.</p>

    <p>Do you want an example of somebody who origionally possessed
    an ordinary good Dutch character and feeling, and yet has since
    modified that feeling, having thought better of it, and who, I
    think, will modify it even more? Then I mention as an example
    Rappard, who now is already much more gentle and humane than
    when I first became acquainted with him. In my opinion, he has
    improved greatly, though he was good already; but I am afraid
    that not everybody will think so, and that he has been in
    conflict about it already. It is true he was good already, but
    still he became dissatisfied with <i>that</i>, and is now
    deeper and more humane than he was. It has not made his life
    easier - he used to have less inner struggle - I am sure of
    that, for I used to call him jokingly &ldquo;the tranquil
    conscience,&rdquo; and teased him about it, which I no longer
    do at all now, because I see a revolution has taken place in
    him. He is a <i>little less</i> elegant, and he is much less
    superficial as a man, and a certain germ of genius has begun to
    develop, and he has sailed clear of the cliff of
    &ldquo;withering.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>As to people who honestly seek the best, I think what Hugo
    says so true: <i>Il y a le rayon noir et il y a le rayon
    blanc.</i> [There is a black ray and there is a white ray.] In
    my opinion, Father has more the rayon noir and Corot has more
    the rayon blanc, but both have a rayon d'en haut.</p>

    <p>So I do not call anybody we mentioned bad, quand m&ecirc;me
    I do not; but I say that the rayon noir has a perilous side.
    And as I have more than once thought over what you said on the
    station platform when you went away, I now say by way of
    explanation of what I could not find words for at the time: I
    know Father is Father, but there is something apart from that,
    namely what we may call the rayon blanc. And in this I find
    more positive, more veritable peace, and my attention is much
    more fixed on it.</p>

    <p>As to Millet, he is, above all others, the man who has this
    white light. Millet has a gospel, and I ask you, isn't there a
    difference between a drawing of his and a nice sermon? The
    sermon becomes black by comparison, even supposing the sermon
    to be good in itself.</p>

    <p>I know that you too are having a hard struggle these days,
    though I do not know exactly how or what it is. At all events I
    tell you exactly what I think about some things out of
    sympathy, because I, too, have had a hard struggle, and have it
    still.</p>

    <p>And more and more I wish this white light were yours. Thanks
    for what you sent me, and a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
