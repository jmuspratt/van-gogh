    <p>[Also enclosed in Letter 69]</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You can well imagine how delightful it was meeting Vincent
    again. I am so glad he is meeting all of them here, too, for no
    one can imagine what a happy life I lead here, surrounded by so
    much love. It will be extremely hard to say goodbye to them
    all. Perhaps I shall stay here until Christmas.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your last letter; the situation you write about
    is not what I am looking for. I shall probably stay in England
    for a while now. And now goodbye; I do hope to see you this
    summer, how lovely that vacation time is drawing so near.</p>

    <p>Vincent is busy showing engravings to the children.</p>

    <p>With much love,</p>

    <p>Yours, Anna</p>
