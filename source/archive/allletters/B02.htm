    <p>Arles, 18<sup>th</sup> March 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Bernard,</p>

    <p>Having promised to write, I want to begin by telling you
    that the country struck me as being as beautiful as Japan for
    the limpidity of the atmosphere and gay colour effects. The
    water makes patches of a beautiful emerald and a rich blue in
    the landscapes, such as we see in crepons [Japanese prints]. The
    pale orange setting sun making the land appear blue. Splendid
    yellow suns.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile I haven't really seen the country in its normal
    summer splendor.</p>

    <p>The costumes of the women are pretty and especially on
    Sunday one sees on the boulevard very naive and well-found
    colour arrangements. And that without doubt will become even
    brighter in summer.</p>

    <p>I regret that life here is not as cheap as I had hoped it
    would be, and up to now I have not found better bargains than
    you would find in Pont Aven.</p>

    <p>I started out by paying 5 Fr. and now I am down to 4 Francs
    a day. It would be necessary to know the locals here and to
    know how to eat bouillabaisse and a&iuml;oli [garlic pat&eacute;] and
    also one needs to find an inexpensive little bourgeois pension.
    If there were several of us, I am given to believe, conditions
    would be more advantageous. There would be perhaps a real
    advantage as well for artists who love the sun and colour that
    exist in the Midi. <label content="art.influences">If the Japanese are not working in their
    country it is certain that their art continues in France. </label>At
    the top of this letter I am sending you a small sketch of <art id=0544>a
    study that I am trying to make something of - sailors with
    their sweethearts going up to the town, which is profiled by
    the strange silhouette of its drawbridge on a huge yellow sun</art>.
    I have <art id=0397>another study of the same drawbridge
    with a group of washerwomen</art>. I will be happy
    with a word from you to know what you are doing and where you
    are going. A good cordial handshake to you and to our
    friends,</p>

    <p>The best to you,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
