    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">I heard from home that you arrived safe and sound at
    Brussels and that your first impression was good.</p>

    <p>I know so well how strange you must feel in the beginning,
    but don't lose courage, you'll get on all right.</label></p>

    <p>You must soon write me how you are getting along and how you
    like your boardinghouse. I hope it will be satisfactory. Father
    wrote me that you are on good terms with Mr. Schmidt; that is
    right - I think he is a good fellow from whom you can learn a
    great deal.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">What happy days we spent
    together at Christmas! I think of them so often. You will also remember them a long time, as they
    were the last days you spent at home.</label> Don't forget to tell me
    what pictures you see and which you like best.</p>

    <p>I am very busy just now at the beginning of the year.</p>

    <p>My New Year began well; they have granted me an increase of
    ten guilders (I therefore earn fifty guilders per month), and
    they have given me a bonus of fifty guilders as a present.
    Isn't that splendid? I hope to be able to shift for myself
    now.</p>

    <p>I am very happy that you work in the same firm. It is such a
    splendid house; the more one works there, the more ambition it
    gives you.</p>

    <p>The beginning is perhaps more difficult than anything else,
    but keep heart, it will turn out all right.</p>

    <p>Will you ask Schmidt what the price of the Album Corot,
    lithographs by &Eacute;mile Vernier is? Somebody asked for it
    at the store, and I know they have it in Brussels. Next time I
    write, I'll send you my picture, which I had taken last Sunday.
    Have you already been to the Palace Ducal? Don't fail to go
    there when you have a chance.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, keep your courage up. All the friends send you
    their compliments and good wishes. Give my regards to Schmidt
    and Eduard and write to me soon. Adieu.</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent.</p>

    <p>You know my address is,</p>

    <p>Lange Beestenmarkt, 32</p>

    <p>Or Goupil &amp; Co., Plaats</p>
