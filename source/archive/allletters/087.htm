    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Write again soon when you have a moment; keep up your
    courage and be strong. I'm enclosing something which I copied
    for you. <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Last night, after I had been at the office till one o'clock,
    I made a detour to the Grote Kerk [Great Church]; then, I went
    along the canal and past by the old gate, I finally arrived at
    the Nieuwe Kerk [New Church], then I returned home. It had
    snowed, a deep silence reigned over everything; I saw here and
    there little bright lights in the windows and, in the snow, the
    black silhouette of a night watchman. It was high tide, and
    beside the snow the canals and ships looked very dark. It was
    charming around the two churches. The sky, grey and foggy, only
    let the moonlight filter through.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">I thought of you on
    this walk. Getting back home, I wrote
    you what you will find in this envelope. </label>You have De Genestet's
    poems, haven't you? Read them as often as you can. Once when I
    was in Paris, Father sent me &ldquo;When I Was a Boy&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;There Is No Priest Who Explains Him.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I am writing you hastily from work, &agrave; Dieu, a
    handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
