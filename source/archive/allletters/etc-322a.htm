    <p>Dr. A. L. C. Furn&eacute;e, formerly pharmaceutical
    chemist in The Hague, was kind enough to put the text of
    letters 351a and 419a at our disposal. He told us that he had
    known Vincent in The Hague as a youth of nineteen; at the time
    Vincent was a friend of his elder brother, the surveyor, who is
    mentioned, for instance, in letters 285, 300, 307, 323,329 and
    342. The latter went out painting with Vincent.<label content="lifestyle.clothing"> Vincent always
    wore a brown &ldquo;peat-carrier's suit&rdquo; with a cap to
    match.</label><label content="lifestyle.appearance"> He used to talk incessantly while working. Dr.
    Furn&eacute;e also visited Vincent's studio; it was very
    disorderly and untidy.</label></p>
