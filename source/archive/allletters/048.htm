    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Herewith I send you the things I promised. I am sure you
    will like the book by Jules Breton. One of his poems, titled
    &ldquo;Illusions&rdquo;, struck me in particular. Happy are
    those whose hearts are so tuned, &ldquo;All things work
    together for good to them that love God&rdquo; is a beautiful
    sentence. It will be thus for you, and the aftertaste of these
    difficult days you will certainly find agreeable.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">But write me how you are feeling soon, and tell me when the
    doctor says you will be well again - that is, if you have not
    done so already.</label></p>

    <p>Two weeks from today I hope to be in Etten. You can imagine
    how I am looking forward to it. Did I you already tell that I
    have taken up smoking a pipe again? I have found in it an old
    faithful friend, I believe that we never more will separate.
    Uncle Vincent told me that you smoke too.</p>

    <p>Give me very best love to the Roos family. Both of us have
    enjoyed many good things in their house, and they have proved
    faithful friends.</p>

    <p>At the moment we have here &Eacute;mile Breton's picture,
    &ldquo;Sunday Morning.&rdquo; You know it, don't you? It is a
    village street of cottages and barns, and at the end is the
    church, surrounded by poplars. Everything is covered with snow,
    and little black figures are going to church. It tells us that
    winter is cold but that human hearts are warm.</p>

    <p>Best wishes, boy, and believe me always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>The packets of chocolate marked X are for you; the others
    are for Mrs. Roos. Smoke the cigarettes together with the rest
    of the family. Adieu.</p>
