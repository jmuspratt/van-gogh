  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and the enclosed 150 fr. I want to
    tell you that I am glad I came here. Last week I painted three
    more studies, one with <art id=0260>backs of old houses, seen from my window</art>,
    two in the park. <label content="business.selling">I have exhibited one of those
    at a dealer's. Further, I have given the ones I brought along
    from the country to two others on commission. At a fourth, I
    can exhibit a view of the quay as soon as the weather permits
    me to make it, because he had a Mols, along with which he could
    exhibit another one. Then I have got an address from this
    dealer, where he assured me I should be well received.</label></p>

    <p>Now these dealers are not the biggest ones in Antwerp, but
    at all their places, among many things I did not like, I saw
    things which pleased me: for instance one had a picture by Van
    Goyen and a study by Troyon; at another's I saw a Mols and
    small Dutch pictures; at another place there was that small
    picture I mentioned to you, like Raffaelli (it is by Moormans),
    and a few good watercolours; at another's I found various good
    marines by young Belgians. I saw very little of figure
    painting, and so I intend to try and do some.</p>

    <p>The address that dealer in question gave me happens to be of
    one of the big dealers, Nicoli&eacute;, one of those who do not
    have show windows, but exhibit in private houses. But I want to
    come there with figure paintings.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Further, I have discovered useful resources for colours,
    etc., where I shall be able to get them fairly cheaply.</label> I have
    also traced Linnig, whom you mentioned to me this summer when I
    asked you whether you knew people in Antwerp; but he has
    <i>nothing</i> but a few miserable little old pictures, paints
    himself somewhat like Vertin, but seemed to me a discouraged
    man - if he ever had any courage, which I doubt.<label content="business.selling"> All these
    gentlemen, however, complain bitterly that trade is so slack,
    but that's not news.</label></p>

    <p>Shortly I hope to be able to go and see that picture you
    wrote about. But I have been busy going backward and forward,
    and also tracing those people, and with model-hunting too. The
    latter is always tremendously difficult, but I have found them
    elsewhere, and so I shall find them here too. For tomorrow I
    have an appointment with a splendid old man - will he come?</p>

    <p>Today I received the supply of colours which they forwarded
    to me from Eindhoven, and I paid more than 50 fr. for it.</p>

    <p>It is hard, terribly hard, to keep on working when one does
    not sell, and when one literally has to pay for one's colour
    out of what would not be too much for eating, drinking and
    lodgings, however strictly calculated. And then the models
    besides. But all the same there is a chance, and even a good
    one, because comparatively speaking, there are only a few
    painters at work nowadays.</p>

    <p>In my opinion they are only half to blame for that (for the
    other half, <i>they are</i>), for sometimes it is too hard.</p>

    <p>All the same they are building State museums, <sup>1</sup>
    and the like, for hundreds of thousands of guilders, but
    meanwhile the artists very often starve.</p>

    <p>But, however this may be, I wanted to look into things
    myself again, and I find the chance of doing something not
    smaller, but bigger than I thought. I have seen several photos
    of pictures by Jan van Beers, some of his things have, after
    all, much character. But I imagine that someone like Manet, for
    instance, is much more of <i>a painter</i> than Van Beers, and
    paints more beautifully and artistically.</p>

    <p>If only I were better known here, if only I could get hold
    of the models I saw! Yesterday I was at the Caf&eacute;-concert
    Scala, something like the Folies Berg&egrave;res;</p>

    <p>I found it very dull, and of course insipid - but the public
    amused me. There were splendid women's heads, really
    extraordinarily fine, among the good middle-class folks on the
    back seats, and on the whole I think what is said about Antwerp
    true, that the women are handsome.</p>

    <p>I say it again, if only I had my choice of models! The mass
    of German girls one sees at the caf&eacute;-concerts leave me
    quite cool, one would say they are all manufactured after one
    model.</p>

    <p>It seems that one sees that same race everywhere, just like
    Bavarian beer, it seems to be an article exported
    wholesale.</p>

    <p>I find all those German elements, which nowadays nestle
    themselves wherever one goes, so terribly annoying. It is sure
    to be just the same in Paris, those Boches intruding
    everywhere. But it is an unpleasant thing to talk about.</p>

    <p>Through seeing some pictures by others, I get all kinds of
    ideas for the time when</p>

    <p>I shall be in the country again next spring; at the same
    time my conviction that I must go on with all the vigour I
    possess is also getting stronger.</p>

    <p>Antwerp is beautiful in colour, and it is worth while just
    for the subjects. One evening I saw a popular sailors' ball at
    the docks; it was most interesting and they behaved
    <i>quite</i><i>decently</i>. However, that will not be the case
    at all those balls.</p>

    <p>Here, for instance, nobody was drunk, or drank much.</p>

    <p>There were several very handsome girls, the most beautiful
    of whom was plain-faced. I mean, a figure that struck me as a
    splendid Jordaens or Vel&aacute;squez, or Goya - was one in
    black silk, most likely some barmaid or such, with an ugly and
    irregular face, but lively and piquant it la Frans Hals.</p>

    <p>She danced perfectly in an old-fashioned style. Once she
    danced with a well-to-do little farmer who carried a big green
    umbrella under his arm, even when he waltzed very quickly.</p>

    <p>Other girls wore ordinary jackets and skirts and red
    scarves; sailors and cabin-boys, etc., the funniest types of
    pensioned sea captains, who came to take a look, quite
    striking. It does one good to see folks actually enjoy
    themselves.</p>

    <p>Well, you see, I don't sit still, but I can't tell you
    emphatically enough how difficult it is to be <i>court
    d'argent</i> [short of money].</p>

    <p>My best chance is in the figure, because there are
    relatively very few who do it, and I must seize the
    opportunity. I must work myself into it here, until I get into
    touch with good figure painters - Verhaert, for instance, and
    then I imagine portrait painting is the way to earn the means
    for greater things.</p>

    <p>I feel a power within me to do something, I see that my work
    holds its own against other work, and that gives me a great
    craving for work; lately, when I was in the country, I began to
    doubt, because I noticed that Portier does not seem to care for
    my things any more.</p>

    <p>If I were better off, I should be able to paint more, but as
    far as producing goes I am partly dependent on my purse.</p>

    <p>I also have an idea for a kind of signboard, which I hope to
    carry out. I mean, for instance, for a fishmonger, still life
    of fishes, for flowers, for vegetables, for restaurants. I
    think that if one takes well-composed subjects, 1 meter by
    &frac12; or &frac34; meter in size, for instance, such a canvas
    would cost me 50 fr., not more, even perhaps 30 fr., and if
    possible I will try to make a few.</p>

    <p>One thing is certain, that I want my things to be seen.
    Later on we may lose courage, but we will try and put it off
    for a long time.</p>

    <p>Write me again if you should have the time. The end of the
    month will certainly be terrible unless you can help me a
    little more. A great deal may depend on my being able to stick
    to my guns. And one must not look too hungry or shabby either.
    On the contrary, one must try to make things hum.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
