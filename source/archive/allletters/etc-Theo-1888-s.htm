    <p>[Letter from Theo to Wil.]</p>

    <p>24 February 1888</p>

    <p>When he came here two years ago I had not expected that we
    would become so much attached to each other, for now that I am
    alone in the apartment there is a decided emptiness about me.
    If I can find someone I will take him in, but it is not easy to
    replace someone like Vincent. It is unbelievable how much he
    knows and what a sane view he has of the world. If he still has
    some years to live I am certain that he will make a name for
    himself. Through him I got to know many painters who regarded
    him very highly. He is one of the avant-garde for new ideas,
    that is to say, there is nothing new under the sun and so it
    would be better to say: for the regeneration of the old ideas
    which through routine have been diluted and worn out. In
    addition he has such a big heart that he always tries to do
    something for others. It's a pity for those who cannot
    understand him or refuse to do so.</p>

    <p>[&hellip;]</p>

    <p>The young school of painting concentrates particularly on
    getting sunshine into their pictures and you will easily
    understand that the grey days we were having offer few subjects
    for painting.<label content="health.general"> Moreover, the cold made him ill. After the years
    of so much worry and adversity he has not become any stronger
    and he really felt the need to be in a softer climate.</label></p>

    <p>[Letter from Theo to Wil.]</p>

    <p>14 March 1888</p>

    <p>Although I know little about it I like hearing music, but
    the occasions to hear something good here are rare, unless one
    goes to the concerts. Still, I went with Vincent a few times to
    listen to a Wagner concert before he left, and we both liked it
    very much. It still seems strange that he has gone, he has
    lately meant so much to me. Soon the studio will be occupied
    again by a young Dutch painter [Arnold Hendrik Koning], but he
    has by no means Vincent's talent, although he is not bad. At
    the end of the month an exhibition will be opened with three of
    Vincent's paintings on view. He does not attach much importance
    to this exhibition, but here where there are so many painters
    it is essential to become known, and an exhibition is, after
    all, the best thing for that.</p>

    <p>[Letter from Theo to Wil.]</p>

    <p>December 1888</p>

    <p>[Of Isa&auml;cson] He doesn't have a penny and his
    life is thus far from easy. I don't know how he would be able
    to make ends meet if he didn't have that good fellow De Haan.
    He is very busy painting portraits, especially in order to make
    some money for models. As far as their brains are concerned,
    both are very clever people, and therefore interesting company.
    As De Haan is physically weak, he stays at home most of the
    time, with the result that we get more people to come and have
    quite a pleasant life&hellip;.</p>

    <p>[Letter from Gauguin to Theo]</p>

    <p>about 12 December 1888</p>

    <p>Dear M. Van Gogh, I would appreciate it if you would send me
    part of the money for the canvases you have sold. Everything
    considered, I am obliged to return to Paris; Vincent and I
    simply cannot live together without trouble, due to the
    incompatibility of our characters, and we both need
    tranquillity for our work. He is a man of remarkable
    intelligence whom I esteem very highly and whom I leave with
    regret, but I repeat, it is necessary. I much appreciate the
    thoughtfulness of your conduct with regard to me, and I hope
    you will excuse my decision.</p>

    <p>[Letter from Theo to his mother.]</p>

    <p>Theo announces his engagement.</p>

    <p>21 December 1888</p>

    <p>My dearest little mother, I recently wrote to you, when I
    had met my friend De Haan, that I sometimes had the feeling as
    if something was being sent to me, but now it is something even
    more important.</p>

    <p>Imagine a few days ago I met Jo Bonger here; what was I to
    do? We stopped to talk to each other and she asked me if she
    might have a word with me. First she wanted to know if I
    thought that it was her fault that I was no longer on good
    terms with Andr&eacute;. From one thing came the other,
    and gradually we became so familiar that I thought there would
    be no harm in looking upon her as a friend, and so she and her
    brother and I became good friends again.</p>

    <p>But, Mother, that was not possible. I loved her too much,
    and now, after we had seen much of each other the last few
    days, she has told me that she loves me too and that she wants
    to have me just as I am. In a way I am afraid that she is
    mistaken about me and that I will disappoint her, but oh! I am
    so happy, and I'll gladly try to understand her and make her
    happy, if I can&hellip;admit I do believe that she knew
    beforehand that I still loved her. And now, my dearest Mother,
    I must ask you to give her your loving Mother's heart too, and
    to help us both with your experience and your advice to become
    good people as is our duty. She can learn a lot from you and
    wants to, and from the bottom of our hearts we both wish to do
    what is good. It is impossible for me to leave here, otherwise
    I would have come with her to you and her parents. Now I have
    to rely on a letter, but I hope to come to Holland the first
    days of January. I have written to her parents today too, and
    she encloses a word for you here&hellip;</p>

    <p>[Letter from Theo to his sister Lies.]</p>

    <p>23 December 1888</p>

    <p>Dearest Lies, You are one of the first whom I want to tell a
    very great piece of news which will cause a great change in my
    life and which makes me incredibly happy. The question is that
    I am engaged to Jo Bonger. When I write this down so simply, I
    still cannot imagine that it is true, such a short time after I
    had exclusively in my mind that it would be forever impossible.
    I can't tell you precisely how it came about as I really don't
    know myself anymore. She has been staying with her brother for
    the last four weeks and was on the point of leaving when I met
    her. We started to see more of each other, and I soon came to
    the conclusion that I loved her just as much as
    before&hellip;.</p>
