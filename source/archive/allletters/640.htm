  <body>
    <p>Dear brother and sister,</p>

    <p>Sunday <sup>1</sup> has left me a very pleasant memory; in
    this way we feel that we are not so far from one another, and I
    hope that we shall often see each other again. Since Sunday I
    have done two studies of houses among the trees. A whole colony
    of Americans has just established itself next door to the house
    where I am; they are painting, but I have not yet seen what
    they are doing.</p>

    <p>On consideration, as for taking this house or else another,
    this is how it is. Here I pay 1 franc a day for sleeping, so
    <i>if I had my furniture</i>, the difference between 365
    francs and 400 would be no great matter, I think, and then I
    should very much like you two to have a pied &agrave;
    terre in the country along with me.</p>

    <p>But I am beginning to think that I must consider the
    furniture lost.</p>

    <p>My friends whom it is with will not, so far as I can see,
    put themselves out to send it to me, as I am no longer there.
    It is mostly the traditional laziness and the old traditional
    story that passing strangers leave temporary furniture in the
    place where it is.</p>

    <p>But I have just written them for the third time that I need
    it; I said in my letter that if I did not hear from them I
    should feel obliged to send them a louis for the cost of
    carriage. Probably that will influence them, but it is bad
    manners. What can you do? It's not quite the same in the South
    as it is the North, the people there do what they like and
    don't take the trouble to think or pay attention to others if
    they are not there.</p>

    <p>Once you are in Paris, you seem to be in another world, and
    I think that they probably won't put themselves out, all the
    more because they will not like to be mixed up any further in
    this business which has been talked about so much in Arles.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.nightmares">All the same it is odd that here the nightmares have ceased
    to such an extent; I always told M. Peyron that returning to
    the North would free me from it, but it is also odd that under
    his direction, though he is very capable and certainly wished
    me well, it was somewhat aggravated.</label></p>

    <p>On my part also it has worried me, reviving all this writing
    to these people.</p>

    <p>I thought that the little one looked well and you two also;
    you must come back soon.</p>

    <p>There is no carrier direct from here to Paris, but there is
    one from Pontoise. Now there is one from Pontoise to here every
    day. So please ask old Tanguy to set to work instantly, taking
    the nails out of all the canvases that are on stretchers up
    there in the attic. He must make rolls of the canvases, and
    packages of the stretchers.</p>

    <p>Then either I will send the carrier from Pontoise, or else I
    will come some time during the next fortnight with M. Gachet to
    get some of them.</p>

    <p>I also saw at your home in the heap under the bed a lot that
    I can touch up, I think, to advantage. I am very sorry not to
    see the Raffaelli exhibition; I should especially like to see
    also your arrangements of those drawings on cretonne that you
    spoke of. Someday or other I think I shall find a way to have
    an exhibition of my own in a caf&eacute;. I should not
    mind exhibiting with Cheret, who certainly must have certain
    ideas about it. Goodbye for now, a good handshake, and wishing
    you good luck, especially with the little one,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

        <p>In a footnote to the original translation, Jo had
        written, &ldquo;We had brought the little one and spent the
        day with Vincent at Dr. Gachet's.&rdquo;</p>
