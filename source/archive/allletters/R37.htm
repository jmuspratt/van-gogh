  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I was just writing you a letter when the postman brought me
    your very welcome letter; I am glad to hear that you have made
    progress with your drawing. I never doubted you would, for that
    matter, for you attacked it in a virile way.</p>

    <p>Now, to begin with I want to tell you that I think what you
    say about the English black-and-white artists perfectly right
    and proper. I saw in your work exactly what you say. Well, I
    quite agree with you - particularly about the bold contour.</p>

    <p>Take Millet's etching &ldquo;The Diggers,&rdquo; take an
    engraving by Albrecht D&uuml;rer, above all take the large
    woodcut by Millet himself, &ldquo;The Shepherdess&rdquo; - then
    you see with full clarity what may be expressed by such a
    contour. And, as you say, you feel &ldquo;that is how I have
    always wanted to do it, if I had always gone my own way,
    etc.&rdquo; That's well said, old fellow, and spoken like a
    man.</p>

    <p>Now I think another example of characteristic, bold and
    vigorous drawing is Leys's pictures, and more especially that
    series of decorations for his dining room - &ldquo;La Promenade
    dans la Neige,&rdquo; &ldquo;Les Patineurs,&rdquo; &ldquo;La
    R&eacute;ception,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Table,&rdquo; &ldquo;La
    Servante.&rdquo; And De Groux has it too, and so has
    Daumier.</p>

    <p>Even Isra&euml;ls, and at times Mauve and Mans too, cannot
    refrain from drawing a vigorous contour, but they <i>don't</i>
    do it in the manner of Leys, or of Herkomer.</p>

    <p>But when you hear them talk, they will have none of it, and
    more often they are talking about &ldquo;tone&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;colour.&rdquo; And yet, in certain charcoal drawings
    Isra&euml;ls has also used lines that remind one of Millet. I
    want to state flatly that personally, however much I admire and
    respect these masters, I regret that, when they speak to
    others, they - and particularly Mauve and Maris - do not point
    out more emphatically what can be done with the contour, and
    advise them to draw cautiously and softly. And so it happens
    that watercolours are the order of the day nowadays, and are
    considered the most expressive medium, whereas in my opinion
    too little attention is being paid to black and white, so much
    so that there is even a certain antipathy against it. There is
    no black, so to speak, in a watercolour, and that is what they
    base themselves on in order to say, &ldquo;Those black
    things.&rdquo; It is not necessary, however, to devote my whole
    letter to this.</p>

    <p>I wanted to tell you that I have four drawings on my easel
    at the moment - peat cutters - sand pit - dunghill - loading
    coal. I even did the dunghill twice; the first one was too
    overworked to be continued.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Besides I have not ventured to work too much in them with
    printer's ink and turpentine; instead I have used charcoal,
    lithographic crayon and autographic ink so far....</label> Except in
    the case of the dunghill that became too overworked; I attacked
    this one with it and not unsuccessfully; it became rather
    black, it's true, but for all that the freshness returned
    somewhat, and now I see my way again to working on it some
    more, although I thought it hopeless before I put on the
    printer's ink.</p>

    <p>I have been working very hard since I visited you; I had not
    done any compositions for such a long time - only a lot of
    studies - that when I once started I went quite wild about it.
    I was pegging away at it many mornings as early as four
    o'clock. I am extremely eager for you to see them, for I can
    make neither head nor tail of what Van der Weele, the only one
    who has seen them, said.</p>

    <p>Van der Weele's opinion was rather sympathetic, but he said
    about the <i>sandpit</i> that there were too many figures in
    it; the composition was not simple. He said, &ldquo;Look here,
    just draw that one little fellow with his wheelbarrow on a
    little dike against the bright sky at sundown; how beautiful
    such a thing would be - now it is too turbulent.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then I showed him Caldecott's drawing &ldquo;Brighton
    Highroad,&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;Do you mean to say that it is
    not permitted per se to introduce many figures into a
    composition? Never mind my drawing, just tell me what you think
    of this composition.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't like that one
    either. But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I am speaking personally,
    and I can't speak any other way than personally, and this is
    not the kind of thing I like and want to look at.&rdquo; Well,
    I thought this well said in a certain way, but you will
    understand that I did not find in him exactly that sound
    knowledge of things which I was looking for. But he is quite a
    sound fellow on the whole, and we took a very pleasant walk
    together, and he pointed out some damned fine things to me.</p>

    <p>It was while taking a walk with him that I saw that sandpit
    too, but he hardly looked at it on that occasion, and next day
    I went back to it alone. I have drawn that sandpit with many
    figures because at times there really are very many fellows
    toiling there, because in winter and in autumn the town gives
    employment in this way to persons who are out of work. And then
    the scene is extremely busy [F 1029, JH 366].</p>

    <p>I have had some beautiful models of late. A superb grass
    mower, a magnificent peasant boy, exactly like figures by
    Millet. A fellow with a wheelbarrow, the same whose head you
    may remember I drew, but then in his Sunday clothes and with a
    Sunday-clean bandage around his blind eye. Now I have him in
    his everyday clothes, and - as I see it - it is difficult to
    believe that this is the same man who posed for both
    studies.</p>

    <p>The size of these four large drawings is 40 x 20 inches.</p>

    <p>I am much pleased with using a brown passe-partout with a
    very deep black inner rim. Then many blacks seem to be grey,
    whereas they would show up too black in a white passe-partout,
    and the whole retains a clear effect.</p>

    <p>Lord, how I wish you could see them, not because I think
    them good myself, but I should like to know what you think of
    them, although I am not yet satisfied with them. In my opinion
    they are not yet sufficiently pure figure drawings, though they
    are figure drawings all right, but I should like to accentuate
    the drawing of the actions and the structure more cleanly and
    boldly.</p>

    <p>What you write about feeling that you are now on a
    <i>road</i><i>,</i> and not on little by-paths and crossroads,
    is very true, in my opinion. I have a similar feeling myself,
    because during the past year I have been concentrating on
    figures even more than I used to.</p>

    <p>If you believe that I have eyes to see with, then you may be
    sure that there most certainly is sentiment in your figures;
    what you are doing is healthy and virile - never doubt yourself
    in this respect, and for the very reason that you do not doubt,
    dash it on without hesitation.</p>

    <p>I think the studies of the heads of those blind fellows are
    superb.</p>

    <p>It must not surprise you that some of my figures are so
    entirely different from the ones that I sometimes make after
    the model. I very seldom work from memory - I hardly practice
    that method. But I am getting so used to being confronted
    immediately with nature that I am keeping my personal feelings
    unfettered to a far greater extent than in the beginning - and
    I get less dizzy - <i>and I am more myself just because I am
    confronted with nature</i>. If I have the good fortune to find
    a model who is quiet and collected, then I draw it repeatedly,
    and then at last a study turns up which is different from an
    ordinary <i>study</i> <i>-</i> I mean more characteristic, more
    deeply <i>felt</i>.</p>

    <p>And yet it was made under the same circumstances as the more
    wooden, less deeply felt studies that preceded it. This manner
    of working is as good as any other - just a little more easily
    understood - like these &ldquo;Little Winter Gardens.&rdquo;
    You said it yourself - they are <i>felt</i>; all right, but
    that was not accidental; I drew them over and over again
    before, and that feeling was <i>not</i> in them then. After
    that - after the iron-like ones - came these, and also that
    clumsiness and awkwardness. <i>How does it happen that I
    express something with that?</i> <i>-</i> because the thing has
    shaped itself in my mind before I start on it.</p>

    <p>The first ones are absolutely repulsive to others. I say
    this to make you under stand that, <i>when</i> there is
    something in it, this is not accidental but most certainly
    <i>reasoned out</i> and <i>willed</i><i>.</i></p>

    <p>I am delighted to hear that you've noticed that I'm doing my
    best at present and that I attach importance to it - to express
    the relation of the values of the masses against each other,
    and to show how in the dizzying tangle of every corner in
    nature things will show up separate.</p>

    <p>Formerly the light and brown in my studies was rather
    fortuitous, at least not logically carried through, and that is
    why they were colder and flatter.</p>

    <p>When once I <i>feel</i> - I <i>know</i> <i>-</i> a subject,
    I <i>usually</i> draw three or more <i>variations</i> of it
    whether it is figure or landscape - but every time and for each
    one I consult nature. And I even <i>do my best not to give
    details</i> - for then the dreaminess goes out of it And when
    Tersteeg and my brother, and others, say, &ldquo;What is this,
    is it grass or cabbage?&rdquo; - then I answer,
    &ldquo;<i>Delighted</i> that you can't make it out.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And yet they are sufficiently true to nature for the honest
    natives of these parts to recognize certain details which I
    have hardly paid any attention to; they will say, for instance,
    &ldquo;Yes, that's Mrs. Renesse's hedge,&rdquo; or,
    &ldquo;Look, there are Van de Louw's beanpoles.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I want to tell you something besides about a kind of Faber
    lead pencil that I have discovered. Here is the diameter of the
    lead; they are soft and of a better quality than the
    carpenter's pencils; they give a glorious black, and are very
    pleasant to work with for large studies. I drew a seamstress
    with it on gray papier sans fin [i<i>.</i>e. cut from the
    roll], and got an effect like lithographic crayon. The lead is
    enclosed in soft wood painted dark green, and they cost 20
    cents apiece.</label></p>

    <p>Before I forget, I should like to borrow from you the issues
    of Harper's magazine you have, for I want to read the articles
    on Holland that are illustrated by Boughton and Abbey. I shall
    send you a package with the old loose numbers I have containing
    illustrations by Howard Pyle and others, so that you can look
    through them at your leisure, and I shall add
    Erckmann-Chatrian's Histoire d'un Paysan, illustrated by
    Sch&uuml;ler, as well as a few illustrations by Green, which
    you'll remember I promised you. If you have some more
    duplicates, please send them along with the Harper's (at least
    if you can spare the latter for some four days, so that I can
    read them), and also Zola's little book about Manet, at least
    if you have finished it.</p>

    <p>I am distressed to hear that your health is not yet what it
    should be; all the same I think that making progress with your
    drawings will reanimate you more than those baths or whatever
    other tricks they may perform at Soden. I think you will long
    to be back in your studio as soon as you have left it. I
    clearly remember how terribly melancholy Mauve was on his
    pilgrimage to a similar kind of works - speaking with all due
    respect.</p>

    <p>As you know, I am rather an infidel about such things, and I
    sympathize with what Br&auml;sig, in Fritz Reuter's Dried
    Herbs<i>,</i> had to say about what this authority called
    &ldquo;die Wasserkunst,&rdquo;I think.[The literal translation
    is &ldquo;water art,&rdquo; but what is meant is
    &ldquo;hydropathic tricks.&rdquo;]</p>

    <p>How beautiful Fritz Reuter's work is! I think you will
    admire that book by Erckmann-Chatrian.</p>

    <p>Another thing I must tell you is that the other day I got
    hold of a marvelous old Scheveningen woman's cape as well as a
    cap, but the cap is not so beautiful. And I shall also get a
    fisherman's jacket with a high turned-up collar and short
    sleeves. I am immensely eager to see your charcoal drawing;
    perhaps when my brother comes here - I don't know exactly when
    - I shall go with him to Bra-bant, and then, as we are passing
    through Utrecht, and if I can manage it, I shall look in on
    you; but at any rate I shall try to come to you without that,
    for I am very curious to see it.</p>

    <p>As for you, try to keep your promise to come to The Hague,
    for you will have to come here anyway for that wedding party,
    you know. If my recent luck with finding models holds out, I
    shall certainly make some more large drawings this summer.</p>

    <p>I should like to go on working on those I have in hand, so
    as to raise them to a high standard against the time my brother
    comes here.</p>

    <p>In Harper's Weekly I came across a very characteristic thing
    after Smedley, the black figure of a man on a white sandy road.
    He calls it &ldquo;A Generation Ago&rdquo;; the figure is some
    kind of clergyman, and perhaps I could describe my impression
    of it thus - Yes, that's what my grandfather looked like. I
    wish I had done it. In the same issues, after Abbey, two girls
    standing fishing on the side of a ditch with pollard willows.
    Both of these things in Harper's are only sketches in a review
    of an exhibition.</p>

    <p>I should like to send you sketches of my drawings, but I
    don't have much time to spare.</p>

    <p>I asked permission to make drawings in the old men's and old
    women's almshouse here, but they refused again. Oh well, there
    are more almshouses in the villages near by. But here I knew
    some fellows that I have used as models. But I went there to
    have a look, and among other things I saw a little old gardener
    near an old twisted apple tree, very characteristic.</p>

    <p>Well, here comes my model. Adieu, send the Harper's if you
    can spare them, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
