  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Your letter and its enclosure came and I paid the landlord
    straight away. Since there is a mortgage on the house, the rent
    is collected by someone else who turned the people downstairs
    out last month and gave them short shrift. What you say about
    dividing the month into 3, so that I would get the money on the
    1st, 10th and 20<sup>th</sup>, is extremely welcome news. That
    will make things much easier for me.</p>

    <p>I need not tell you what a relief your letter was.</p>

    <p>Did you receive the drawing,<art id=938> &ldquo;The Fish Drying
    Barn&rdquo;?</art> I am busy doing a few more of them, so that you
    will have <art id=940>2 or 3 done in the same way</art>. C. M. has also got some
    done like this but I haven't heard from him yet.</p>

    <p>I want to tell you something about what you seem to be
    afraid of, namely the possibility that the family may want to
    take steps to place me under legal guardianship. If you really
    think &ldquo;<i>a few witnesses (and even then false ones) are
    all that would be needed to testify that you cannot manage your
    financial affairs and that would be enough</i> to entitle
    Father to deprive you of your civil rights and place you under
    guardianship,&rdquo; if, I say, you really think that this sort
    of thing is so easy to do these days, then I take the liberty
    of questioning it.</p>

    <p>The legal procedure of guardianship, which has been
    disgracefully abused so often in order to get rid of
    individuals considered &ldquo;troublesome&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;unpleasant&rdquo; (mauvais coucheur [awkward customer]),
    can no longer be applied quite so easily these days. And the
    law gives the accused the right to appeal and many another
    remedy.</p>

    <p>But you might say: a clever lawyer can twist the law, etc.,
    etc. Que soit, I tell you that it isn't quite so quick and easy
    to place somebody under guardianship nowadays&hellip;I know of
    a case in which even the Jesuits failed to have a guardianship
    order placed on someone they wanted out of the way, for the
    simple reason that the man said, &ldquo;I am positively the
    last person for whom a guardianship order is even slightly
    appropriate,&rdquo; and refused to give in.</p>

    <p>Again, there was the case of someone who, placed under
    supervision somewhere against his will so that he couldn't go
    where he chose, warned the person under whose supervision he
    had been placed that he had no right to deprive him of his
    liberty and that he would have to let him go &hellip; warned
    him a few times coolly and quite calmly, but was rebuffed. Then
    bashed his guardian's brains in with a poker and stood there
    quite calmly and gave himself up. The case was investigated and
    the result was a complete acquittal, since in certain extreme
    cases there exists a &ldquo;right of self-defence,&rdquo; and
    when the murder question came up the original case was
    re-examined and it turned out that the accused was not someone
    who merited guardianship.</p>

    <p>In short, it is far from easy nowadays to place under
    guardianship someone who protests in a calm, manly and open
    manner. I really do not believe that the family would do
    anything like that &hellip; but, you may say, they already
    tried to do it on the Gheel occasion. Alas, yes, Father is
    capable of doing it, but I must tell you that if he dares to
    try anything of the sort again, I shall resist him for all I'm
    worth. He had best think twice before he starts attacking me,
    but once again, I doubt they would dare do such a thing. If
    they do have the will and the temerity, I am not going to say,
    &ldquo;Oh, please don't do that,&rdquo; but on the contrary
    will have no hesitation in letting them get on with it so that
    they incur public disgrace and are saddled with the costs of
    the case.</p>

    <p>Let me tell you, I know of a case where a noble and very
    rich family tried to place somebody under guardianship and
    enlisted the services of lawyers and Jesuits - and yet failed
    with the person in question - although there were <i>two</i>
    complaints raised against him, in the first place his
    incompetence in financial affairs and in the second place his
    being of unsound mind. He protested and the judge let the
    family know unofficially that they would do well to drop the
    case. The family had to give up even before the legal
    proceedings actually started.</p>

    <p>Now I would just like to add this - since you are aware that
    I would always protest against anything of the kind, if at some
    time or other they should try to take advantage of my being ill
    or indisposed, by, for instance, &ldquo;taking action against
    me,&rdquo; you will know that it is without my consent. In the
    event of my being ill, I hope you would object if anyone tried
    to profit from my helplessness. When my health is good I can
    take care of myself and am afraid of nothing of that sort. And
    I simply cannot imagine anyone really taking such a step - but
    should you ever hear that such moves are afoot, please let me
    know.</p>

    <p>I don't mean if they are <i>talking</i> about it or
    <i>saying</i> something about it, of course, I take no notice
    of tittle-tattle, but I do take notice when it is translated
    into action. If they should <i>do</i> something, then I hope
    you will warn me. I know the law on guardianship, and <i>I do
    not believe they can do anything to me</i>.</p>

    <p>Once before in my life, though many years ago, I received a
    letter written in the same vein as your last one. And that was
    from H. G. T., whom I had consulted about something, and I have
    regretted ever since that I broached the matter with him. I
    well remember that I was seized by a kind of panic at the time
    and that I was frightened of my family. Now, some 10 or 12
    years later, I have learned to think differently of my
    obligations towards and relations with my family.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.father">Father keeps going on about the &ldquo;respect and
    obedience&rdquo; I am supposed to owe him. I shall not claim
    that a child does not owe his parents respect and obedience,
    all I want is to point out that Father has taken undue
    advantage of it more than once, for instance by immediately
    labelling as disrespectful any difference of opinion one may
    have with him.</label> It would be a pretty kettle of fish if I ordered
    my life the way Father would like me to. My drawing would most
    certainly come to an end, for I should be unable to do any
    more. I might be able to come to terms with Father's way of
    thinking and talk things over with him if he acquired some
    understanding of art, but that will never happen.<label content="attitude.clergy"> Clergymen
    often introduce &ldquo;things of beauty&rdquo; into a sermon,
    but it's dismal stuff and dreadfully stodgy.</label></p>

    <p>Now I am glad that you have given me your frank opinion of
    Sien, namely that she tricked me and that I allowed myself be
    taken in, and I can understand why you should think that,
    because such things do happen. However, I remember once when a
    girl did try something like that, I shut the door in her face
    so hard that I rather doubt I am likely to be taken in by such
    sharp practices.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.love">The way matters stand with Sien is that I am genuinely
    attached to her and she to me - that she is my loyal helpmate,
    who goes everywhere with me - and who is becoming more
    indispensable to me by the day. I feel less passion for her
    than I did for Kee Vos last year. But the kind of love I have
    for Sien is the only one I am still capable of after the
    disappointment of that first passion. She and I are two unhappy
    people who keep each other company and share a burden, and that
    is precisely why unhappiness is making way for happiness, and
    the unbearable is becoming bearable.</label></p>

    <p>Her mother is a little old woman just like the ones
    Fr&egrave;re paints.</p>

    <p>Now you will understand that, given that I remain faithful
    to her, I should set little store by the formality of marriage
    were it not that the family does. Father, for one, and I know
    this for certain, attaches great importance to it, and although
    he won't approve of my marrying her, he would consider it even
    worse if I lived with her without being married. His advice
    would be to leave her, and he would give that advice in this
    form: <i>wait</i>, which is cold comfort and quite
    inappropriate. That is typical of Father&hellip;he puts things
    off that are urgent and pressing, and this can be absolutely
    infuriating. So Father had best keep his &ldquo;waiting&rdquo;
    to himself, for if he came out with it, I should not be able to
    contain myself.</p>

    <p>I am a man of 30 with wrinkles on my forehead and lines on
    my face that make me look 40 and my hands are full of furrows -
    yet when Father looks at me through his spectacles he sees me
    as a little boy (1&frac12; years ago Father wrote to me,
    &ldquo;You are in your first youth&rdquo;). And that is said
    with the tuppence-worth of profundity I have heard so often
    before.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I think Father and Uncle Stricker are like?
    Like `Les deux augures' by G&eacute;r&ocirc;me. But I am a
    &ldquo;mauvais coucheur&rdquo; - que soit.</p>

    <p>Now you will say, Vincent, you had far better lose yourself
    in perspective and the Fish Drying Sheds. And then I shall say,
    you are quite right, brother, and that is why I am getting down
    to work on the two drawings that go with that first one, and
    which you will soon be receiving as proof that I like nothing
    better than losing myself in nature and drawing and not losing
    myself in such things as being placed under guardianship which
    seem to me utterly ridiculous. Regards, with my heartfelt
    thanks for your loyal help,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I kept this letter back because I wanted to send you the
    small drawings at the same time, but they still need more work.
    One is finished, though, namely another <art id=946a>fish drying shed</art>.
    Sien and I have been camping in the dunes from
    morning till night for days on end, like real Bohemians. We
    took bread along and a small bag of coffee and fetched hot
    water from a hot-water-&amp;-coals woman in Scheveningen.</p>

    <p>That hot-water-&amp;-coals woman and her surroundings are
    marvellous, charming beyond words, I've called at her little
    shop as early as 5 o'clock in the morning when the
    street-sweepers go there for their coffee. My dear fellow, that
    would really be something to draw!!! Just getting the people I
    want to pose would cost a pretty penny, but I've a good mind to
    do it.</p>

    <p>Write to me when you get a chance, particularly what you
    think of these last three drawings. And also if it is really
    your view that I ought to be more afraid than I am of being
    placed under guardianship, to my mind an impossible
    eventuality. Because I should not remain indifferent if steps
    were actually being taken, that goes without saying. Having to
    go to Etten would be most inconvenient for me right now, in the
    first place because I'm so busy, and 2<sup>nd</sup> because the
    trip would cost more than I feel I can afford and I would
    sooner spend it on Sien.</p>

    <p>I think it a delightful prospect that you are coming, I am
    longing to know what impression Sien will make on you. There is
    nothing special about her, she is just an ordinary woman of the
    people who has something of the sublime for me. Whoever loves a
    plain, ordinary person and has endeared himself to her is happy
    - despite the dark side of life. Had she not needed help last
    winter then the bond between her and me would not have been
    forged in the circumstances, that is after my disappointment
    and spurned love. As it was, however, it was precisely the
    feeling of being able to do something useful apr&egrave;s tout
    [after all], despite that disappointment, that brought me to
    myself again and revived me. Not that I went out looking for
    it, but I found it, and now there is a warm affection between
    her and me and it would be quite wrong to give that up.</p>

    <p>I might easily have grown disenchanted and sceptical if I
    had not met Sien - but she and my work now keep me going. And I
    should like to add this: because Sien has taken to all the toil
    and moil of a painter's life and is so willing to pose, I think
    I shall become a better artist with her than if I had ended up
    with Kee Vos. For though Sien is not as graceful, and her
    manners are perhaps, or rather certainly, quite different, she
    is so full of goodwill and d&eacute;vouement [devotion] that I
    am moved by it.</p>

    <p>Heyerdahl has seen Sorrow now, but I should be glad if a
    draughtsman, for instance Henri Pille, could have a look at the
    last three drawings. I'm sure H. Pille no longer remembers me -
    though I have been in his company and know that he is someone
    who can behave very oddly at times - and I don't know whether
    he would say anything. But all I should want to know is whether
    the drawings make any impression on him and if they appeal to
    him. I say this in case you run into Henri Pille from time to
    time, for it would have to be as if by chance that you let him
    see them.</p>

    <p>I must also repeat that I am getting on very well with my
    collection of woodcuts, which I regard as belonging to you,
    with me holding a life-interest in them. I now have a good
    thousand sheets of English (mainly Swains), American and
    French. And Rappard, for instance, who is also collecting them
    these days, was greatly taken with them. So that is something
    which belongs to you though you haven't seen it yet. I only
    regret that I was unable to buy Dor&eacute;'s London recently,
    for which the Jew asked 7.50 guilders, which I couldn't afford.
    And also a Boetzel Album. Anyway, when you come here, you shall
    have a look at them and, I hope, like them, and perhaps through
    them become acquainted with some artists of whom you knew
    little or nothing until now.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
