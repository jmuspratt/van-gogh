  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today I have painted another head of a model, whom I could
    not pay however; but having the opportunity, I profited by
    it. [Painting lost]</p>

    <p>I also have the firm promise that I shall paint somebody's
    portrait, and in return for it, two studies that I can
    keep.</p>

    <p>But I must tell you that I am at the end of my rope, with my
    last remaining 5 fr. I had to buy two canvases for those two
    portraits, and the laundry woman has just brought me my clean
    linen, so that for the moment I have only a few centimes
    left.</p>

    <p>So I must ask you most urgently, for Heaven's sake don't put
    off writing, and send me much or little, according to what you
    can spare, but remember that I am literally starving.</p>

    <p>If I succeeded in getting about 50 heads, then there is some
    chance of getting work - that is, I can try to get employment
    at a photographer's, which I would not like to do permanently
    but only in time of need. The photographers seem to be quite
    flourishing here. One also finds painted portraits in their
    studios, which are obviously painted on a photographed
    background, which is of course both weak and ineffective to
    anybody who knows anything about painting.</p>

    <p>Now it seems to me that one could get a much better
    colouring if one worked from studies painted directly from life
    on the photographs which one wants to have painted. And, after
    all, this is at least one of the chances one might have to earn
    something.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">But whatever and wherever I may want to start, of course I
    must have things to show. Because I need all my good spirits,
    all my vitality, I must confess I am afraid of feeling
    physically weak.</label></p>

    <p>I showed my view of &ldquo;Het Steen&rdquo; to another
    dealer, who liked its tone and colour, but he was too engrossed
    in making up his inventory, and besides, he has little room,
    but he asked me to come back after New Year's. It is just the
    thing for foreigners who want to have a souvenir of Antwerp,
    and for that reason I shall make even more city views of that
    kind.</p>

    <p>So yesterday I made a few drawings of a spot with a view of
    the Cathedral.</p>

    <p>I also made a little one of the Park.</p>

    <p>But I prefer painting people's eyes to cathedrals, for there
    is something in the eyes that is not in the cathedral, however
    solemn and imposing the latter may be - a human soul, be it
    that of a poor beggar or of a streetwalker, is more interesting
    to me.</p>

    <p>So I firmly believe that nothing helps so much to make
    direct progress as working from the model.</p>

    <p>Of course it is a great nuisance to have to pay the models -
    now is the time when all energy is needed, and the pictures
    will have to be energetic in order to find buyers.</p>

    <p>That there is business to be done here, I am sure. There
    seems to be a lot of beautiful women in this city, and I feel
    sure that money is to be earned by painting women's portraits
    or fantasy heads and figures of women.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">It is a real delight to me to work with a better kind of
    brushes, and to have cobalt and carmine, and the right kind of
    brilliant yellow and vermilion.</p>

    <p>The most expensive colours are sometimes the cheapest,
    especially cobalt - the delicate tones one can get with it
    cannot be compared with those of any other blue.</p>

    <p>And although the quality of the colour is not everything in
    a picture, it is what gives it life.</label></p>

    <p>As to whether I should like to settle down here for good or
    not - as the art trade does not seem exactly rose-coloured
    here, and as there seems to be a certain tendency for each of
    the painters to be his own art dealer, which I suppose will
    increase more and more - the most sensible thing would be
    perhaps to keep a studio here.</p>

    <p>If you have any wishes or ideas about it, either in favour
    of it or against it, I shall be glad if you will tell me so
    straight out.</p>

    <p>But it strikes me at once that, if after a longer or shorter
    time you might decide to set up yourself (independent of the
    Goupils), Antwerp might be the place where, given the dismal
    show windows at present, business might be done by showing good
    things, which the other firms do not understand.</p>

    <p>And then it is so convenient to cross over to England from
    here.</p>

    <p>Why are all pictures always in frames in the art-dealing
    business? It would be so much better for business if they were
    light and easy to handle and dispatch.</p>

    <p>Trade is so old-fashioned and&hellip;three times mouldy.</p>

    <p>There must be renovation, for the old systems no longer
    work.</p>

    <p>The prices, the public, everything needs renovation, and the
    future is to work cheaply for the people, because the ordinary
    art lovers seem to get more and more tight-fisted.</p>

    <p>Starting with capital so very often leads only to losing
    everything at first, including one's courage and energy;
    whereas beginning with practically nothing rather makes one's
    character firmer and more decided.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">Goodbye, but try to write me by return mail, for I am
    feeling rather faint, as I have somewhat overstrained myself
    with one thing and another, and I need my strength.</label></p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
