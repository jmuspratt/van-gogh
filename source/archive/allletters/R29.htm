  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter, which I had been looking forward to
    eagerly. Oh, I am not at all surprised to hear that you admire
    the sheets I sent you. Personally I cannot imagine anything
    more beautiful than the &ldquo;Harbour of Refuge&rdquo; or the
    &ldquo;Low Lodginghouse.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Now you must come soon to get the rest. I cannot think of a
    better way for you to find out which duplicates you have than
    to come look them over and make your selection, for making a
    list of the titles would be too inconvenient on all sides. If
    you think you won't be able to come in the near future,
    however, and if you would like to have them, I can make a
    package of all the duplicates I have and send it to you; then
    you can keep the ones you don't have yet and send back the
    rest. Remember, if you prefer it, I shall do so with the
    greatest of pleasure.</p>

    <p>I have a request to make: please send me the <i>worst</i>
    print you already had of Herkomer's &ldquo;Old Women's
    Almshouse&rdquo; (from that French Illustration<i>).</i> I have
    it myself, of course, but there's somebody here I want to start
    a collection for, namely the painter Van der Weele, who is
    drawing master at the secondary school here. He himself has
    done some ten etchings - a bit meager but nevertheless well
    done - but in his studio I saw a first-rate sketch of a
    ploughed field in the evening, and an excellent little easel
    piece on wood besides, called &ldquo;Loading Hay on a
    Wagon,&rdquo; of which he has also done an etching. He is the
    sort of man to develop a true liking for it - at least I hope
    so - and it may induce him to continue to work vigorously in
    black and white, in lithography, etching or drawing - it
    doesn't matter which.</p>

    <p>On this man's behalf I should like to ask you to let me have
    all the duplicates you have available - I think you have
    R&eacute;gamey's &ldquo;Gypsies,&rdquo; for instance.</p>

    <p>I hope you'll meet him someday; he is a sound kind of
    fellow. In order to be sure that I don't give him any sheets
    you may not have yourself, I'll give you herewith a list of
    what I've set apart for him:</p>

    <p>This week I bought a number of issues of this year's
    Illustration<i>,</i> Le Monde illustr&eacute; and Univers
    Illustr&eacute;<i>.</i> Now I have duplicates of the sheets
    &ldquo;Enfants assist&eacute;s,&rdquo; all six of them, and I
    shall specify them again to be sure that you have them all:</p>

    <p>- &ldquo;L'abandon&rdquo;</p>

    <p>- &ldquo;La creche&rdquo;</p>

    <p>- &ldquo;Le change&rdquo;</p>

    <p>- &ldquo;Le Num&eacute;ro 68, 762&rdquo;</p>

    <p>- &ldquo;Passe au r&eacute;fectoire - Heure de la
    bouillie&rdquo;</p>

    <p>- &ldquo;Sheet with sketches: rachitique, scrofuleux,
    etc.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Should there be any number missing in your collection, I
    shall send it to you. I hope to be able to get <art id=mptychair>Fildes's
    &ldquo;Charles Dickens Empty Chair&rdquo;</art> for you. It has been
    promised to me.</p>

    <p>I am sending you herewith a sample of that lithographic
    paper; I have scribbled a little on it with lithographic crayon
    and autographic ink and engraving ink, more to combine the
    various methods on the same sample than to advise you to tire
    out the uninitiated by applying so many methods at once under
    ordinary circumstances, of course. I scribbled it on a scrap I
    had left, and I have no time to do it better.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">What can you see from it? - (1) what kind of paper it is;
    (2) on which side you must draw; (3) what kinds of things one
    can do on it - but the autographic ink is treacherous.
    Sometimes the transferring succeeds quite well, but at other
    times the ink runs (for the drawing is wetted before it is laid
    face down on the grained stone, and then run through the press
    to be printed). So it may happen that the ink starts running,
    and in that case you get nothing but a black blot instead of
    your drawing.</label></p>

    <p>All the same it <i>can</i> be done - and the important thing
    is that you can retouch the drawing with ink on the stone
    itself.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">At the same time I am sending you two samples of coarse
    paper which I think is very suitable for mounting the wood
    engravings. They show up well just because it is so rough, and
    its colour is lovely.</label></p>

    <p>The alterations in my studio have turned out very well
    indeed; the light is wonderful now, and I am delighted with
    it.</p>

    <p>I have finished cutting out and mounting the wood engravings
    from the Graphic<i>.</i> Now that they are arranged in an
    orderly manner, they show up ever so much better.</p>

    <p>Do you know Daziel as a black-and-white artist? I have a
    &ldquo;Public House&rdquo; by him - something like the one by
    Green - excellent.</p>

    <p>Well, amice, perhaps I shall write more soon. I wanted to
    send you the sample of the lithographic paper without delay,
    but I am very busy. So goodbye, write again soon, and believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I have a magnificent Giacomelli, a large sheet representing
    a &ldquo;Flight of Crows.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I know your beautiful Bodmer, &ldquo;Grands Ducs,&rdquo;
    very well, but I don't have it.</p>

    <p>There must be many fine things in that old volume of
    <i>L'Illustration.</i></p>
