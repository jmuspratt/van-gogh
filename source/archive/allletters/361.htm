  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I just received your letter. As your letter crossed one of
    mine, written in the same tone as the one you answered today,
    you will see that I am speaking in a different mood than the
    rash one which you suppose. Just because I say what I have to
    say quietly, be it not in tone which is used every day (it is a
    serious question here), I cannot avail myself of your kindness
    in considering it said &ldquo;in haste.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>That very idea of yours (that I should have spoken in haste,
    and rashly) is sufficient proof to me that we have come to a
    point where mere words won't do any good, and I think it better
    to let this question rest</p>

    <p>You say, you <i>must</i> speak about the financial side. So
    must I.</p>

    <p>Brother, know it well, I repeat what I said before about
    your noble help without any alteration - and that &ldquo;money
    <i>can</i> be repaid, but not kindness such as
    yours.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But this is what I want, and what you yourself will call
    reasonable. I must take such measures as are necessary to have
    freedom in disposing of what I receive.</p>

    <p>I mean that I can only accept such money as I can spend as I
    like, without having to ask anybody's opinion.</p>

    <p>I would rather have 100 francs a month and the free use of
    it, than 200 francs without that freedom.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">If we were more of one mind in our way of looking at things,
    I should think an agreement like the one between you and me up
    to now by far the best.</label></p>

    <p>And because of too great a difference in our ways of looking
    at things, because of our understanding each other too little,
    an agreement like the one between you and me is neither tenable
    nor sensible.</p>

    <p>Supposing that your character <i>as well as</i> mine wants
    to avoid disorderliness or outbreaks of violence after all; we
    must part company quietly and collectedly - but decisively, in
    such a way that neither you nor I can be reproached with
    foolishness or recklessness.</p>

    <p>I should like to receive the usual amount until March. That
    will enable me to pay everything I have to pay, and to lay up a
    supply of necessary things. This is the first measure to be
    taken.</p>

    <p>Last year, the year '83, was a hard, sad year for me, and
    the end especially was - bitterly, bitterly sad.</p>

    <p>Well, we will not speak of that any more.</p>

    <p>After March we shall both be free. But if you could pay
    Father some allowance for a time, as I do not want to be too
    great a burden to him, that will be wise and well, I think.</p>

    <p>However, this must be between Father and you. If necessary,
    I shall then try and get a job. I do not even care what kind.
    But bear in mind that, realizing the fact that obviously we
    could not agree sufficiently if we continued together, I am
    absolutely serious about trying not to accept favours from you
    in the form of money any longer if they should not leave me
    quite free in my concept of life.</p>

    <p>You will say that you leave me free, yes - but there is a
    certain restraint after all. And I prefer to have less from
    somebody else, when <i>after all I am not free in things that
    are nobody's business but my own</i>.</p>

    <p>You must not infer from this that I want to have done with
    you, on the contrary - you are an art dealer, very well, when I
    make something which you think saleable, I should prefer to
    sell it to you rather than to somebody else, but it must be an
    arrangement which does not put me in a false position; but in
    point of fact what I want is to <i>sell</i> in the literal
    sense.</p>

    <p>I thank you for your letter, I appreciate many things in it.
    Goodbye, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
