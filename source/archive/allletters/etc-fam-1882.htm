    <p>Reverend Van Gogh to Theo, on visiting Vincent in
    hospital.</p>

    <p>14 June 1882</p>

    <p><label content="health.venereal">Vincent was somewhat surprised to see me, he was a little
    irritated, but I succeeded in bringing him back to a more
    normal mood, and promised to come back the next day. He does
    not look bad, his pulse is calm, and he is quite normal.</label> <label content="business.sales">He
    nurses grievances against Uncle Cor because he has not been
    very enthusiastic about his drawings. </label>Van Rappard, who had seen
    them, had called them good. This Van Rappard remains faithful
    to him; he has written Vincent again to encourage him.</p>

    <p>[&hellip;] I hope that there could not be any danger in that
    so-called model, could there?</p>

    <p>[&hellip;] He always remains strange, and my expectations
    are not great; if only he does not go down more and more, and
    if only he does not throw himself away on an unworthy
    creature&hellip;Don't say I am too suspicious; I say these
    things to no one but you, and you will understand only too well
    what I fear. He has always had a pechant for people of lower
    classes, and out of sheer cussedness and a feeling of
    loneliness a man might get entangled in the wrong sort of
    ties.</p>

    <p>Reverend Van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>28 November 1882</p>

    <p>Cor is enjoying much friendship from the Carp family in
    Helmond, one of the most distinguished families in that town.
    Therefore on St. Nicholas Day Cor should give a present to Naud
    Carp who is at the H. B. [Hogere Burgerschool] with him.</p>
