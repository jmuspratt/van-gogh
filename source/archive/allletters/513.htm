    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">If I were younger, I'm sure I'd want to suggest to old
    Boussod that he send you and me to London without any other
    salary than 200 francs a month credit, but you to get half the
    profit on the impressionist pictures, which they could deduct
    from this salary of 200 fr.</p>

    <p>But our carcasses are no longer young, and to undertake a
    journey to London in order to scrape together some money for
    the impressionists would be a job for Boulanger, or Garibaldi,
    or Don Quixote. And besides, old Boussod would send us away
    with a flea in our ear if we suggested anything like that to
    him.</label></p>

    <p>Only I would rather see you going to London than to New
    York.</p>

    <p>These painter's fingers are growing supple, even though the
    carcass is going to pieces. And the merchant's head for selling
    - and a long job to learn it is - is getting more experience
    too. In our situation, which you may well say is so precarious,
    we must not forget our advantages, and let's try to hang on to
    our patience to do the right thing and see clearly. Isn't it
    true, for instance, that in any case it is better if someday
    they say to you, &ldquo;Go to London,&rdquo; than chuck you
    out, your services no longer being required?</p>

    <p>I am getting older than you, and my ambition is to be less
    of a burden to you. And, if no actual obelisk of too pyramidal
    a catastrophe occurs, and there's no rain of frogs in the
    meantime, I hope to achieve it sometime.</p>

    <p>I have just taken thirty painted studies from the
    stretchers. If it's only our living we're after in
    <i>business</i> affairs, would it be such a hardship to go to
    London, where I think there is more chance of selling than
    elsewhere? In any case, I tell myself that out of the thirty
    studies I shall send you, you will not be able to sell one in
    Paris. But then, as old Prinsenhage would say,
    &ldquo;Everything gets sold.&rdquo; And in our case, what I do
    is not <i>saleable</i> like the Brocharts for instance, but it
    can be sold to people who buy things because there is
    <i>nature</i> in them.</p>

    <p>Why, a canvas I have covered is worth more than a blank
    canvas.</p>

    <p>That - believe me my pretensions go no further - that is my
    right to paint, my reason for painting, and by the Lord, I have
    one!</p>

    <p>All it has cost me is a carcass pretty well destroyed and
    wits pretty well crazed, and only to lead the same life I might
    lead if I were a philanthropist.</p>

    <p>All it has cost you is, say, 15,000 francs, which you have
    advanced to me.</p>

    <p>Well then&hellip;they've no reason to chuck us out.</p>

    <p>Here's the conclusion of the whole matter: when dealing with
    this Boussod, keep cool and keep your head.</p>

    <p>And if they talk to you about London, <i>don't</i> put the
    thing just as crudely to them as I did at the beginning of this
    letter. But you do well not to resist the powers that be (such
    powers!).</p>

    <p>My dear brother, if I were not broke and crazy with this
    blasted painting, what a dealer I'd make just for the
    impressionists. But there, I am broke. London is good, London
    is just what we need, but alas I feel I cannot do what I once
    could. But broken down and none too well myself, I do not see
    <i>any</i> misfortune in your going to London; if there is fog
    there, well, that seems to be increasing in Paris too.</p>

    <p>What's wrong - basically - is that we are getting older, and
    must behave accordingly; that's <i>all there is to
    it</i><i>.</i> Yet there is something for as well as against,
    and we must make the best of it.</p>

    <p>It seems queer that you have not had any news of Gauguin
    either. I suppose that he is sick and discouraged.</p>

    <p>If I reminded you just now of what painting costs us, it is
    only to emphasize what we ought to tell ourselves - that we
    have gone too far to turn back, that's all I harp on. For,
    material existence aside, what else shall I ever need?</p>

    <p>If Gauguin cannot pay his debts nor his fare, if he can
    guarantee me a cheaper life in Brittany - why shouldn't I go to
    him if we want to help him?</p>

    <p>If he says, &ldquo;I am at the height of my powers and my
    talent,&rdquo; why shouldn't I say the same myself?</p>

    <p>But then, we are not at the height of our finances, so we
    must do what comes cheapest.</p>

    <p>Lots of painting, few expenses, that is the line we must
    take. So once again I tell you that I lay aside all preference,
    either for the North or the South. Whatever plans one makes,
    there's always a root of difficulty somewhere. It would all be
    plain sailing with Gauguin, but once you shift him, is he going
    to be content?</p>

    <p>But since no plans can be made, I am not worrying about the
    precariousness of our position.</p>

    <p>Knowing and feeling this will wake us up and make us get on
    with the job.</p>

    <p>If we do this and make a mess of it, which I myself doubt,
    we shall have something left. But I can see nothing in the
    future when one sees people like Gauguin up against a blank
    wall. Let us hope that there will be a way out for him and for
    us.</p>

    <p>If I were to think of and dwell on disastrous possibilities,
    I could do nothing. I throw myself headlong into my work, and
    come up again with my studies;<label content="food-and-drink.alcohol"> if the storm within gets too
    loud, I take a glass too much to stun myself.</label></p>

    <p>Cracked, of course; when you look at what one <i>ought to
    be</i>.</p>

    <p>But in the old days I used to feel less of a painter, now
    painting is becoming a distraction for me, like rabbit hunting
    for the cracked-brained: they do it to distract themselves.</p>

    <p>My concentration becomes more intense, my hand more
    sure.</p>

    <p>That is why I almost dare to swear to you that my painting
    will improve. Because I have nothing left but that.</p>

    <p>Have you read in de Goncourt's book that Jules Dupr&eacute;
    gave them the impression that he was cracked too?</p>

    <p>Jules Dupr&eacute; had found a collector fellow who was
    paying him. If only I could find that, and not be such a burden
    on you!</p>

    <p>After the crisis which I went through when coming down here,
    I can make no plans or anything; I am decidedly better now, but
    <i>hope</i>, the <i>desire to succeed</i> is gone, and I work
    <i>because I must</i>, so as not to suffer too much mentally,
    so as to distract my mind.</p>

    <p>Yesterday McKnight broke his silence a little by saying that
    he liked my <art id=0430>last </art>two<art id=0429> studies </art>(the garden of flowers) very much,
    and talked about them for a very long time.</p>

    <p>Well - but do you realize that if you were <i>on your
    own</i>, you might perhaps have to look for English business
    relations? That is to say, once more, would it really be such a
    great hardship to go to London - if it is inevitable, is there
    any need to be miserable about it? After all there is no
    comparison; except for the climate, it is infinitely better
    than the Congo.</p>

    <p>A good handshake, and many thanks for your letter and the
    50-fr. note.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
