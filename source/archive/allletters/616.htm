  <body>
    <p>Dear Mother,</p>

    <p>I can understand quite well what you say in your letter,
    namely that it did you good &ldquo;to be again with
    many,&rdquo; when A.s' children were with you. Wil has
    described the house elaborately to me, and I am very glad that
    your experience proves to you that the motive for the change
    was justified. And thus I hope that you will still spend many
    quite good days in Leyden - and be sure that I think of you
    often,<label content="lifestyle.reclusive"> here where I spend my days more withdrawn into myself
    than now and then seems to me desirable.</label></p>

    <p><label content="health.general">Yet I have decidedly no reason at all to complain, feeling
    stronger and healthier and quieter than before, and compared
    with this time last year, when I really had no thought of
    recovering. Yet I shall always keep on feeling the shock, and
    it will be best to stick to my work, leaving the rest alone as
    hardly being compatible with it, and as worrying cannot do
    much good.</label></p>

    <p>As for the exhibition in Brussels, it does not leave me
    indifferent because I shall have a few pictures from here in it
    which, though made in quite a different region, remain just as
    if they were painted say in Zundert, or Calmpthout, and I think
    they could also be understood by people who haven't any
    knowledge of painting, as it is called. And so one may say, It
    would have been simpler if I had stayed quietly in North
    Brabant - but it is as it is, and what can one do?</p>

    <p>I suppose that your thoughts are often with Theo and Jo; I
    think it an excellent plan that Wil is going to lend a helping
    hand in January, and I hope it will come about. If you go and
    stay with Aunt Mina in the meantime, she will be pleased too,
    now that Aunt is ill. When you see her, don't forget to
    remember me to her, will you? According to what you write she
    is courageous in suffering without complaint.</p>

    <p>I intend to spend a great part of next year here too, as it
    would be best for my work, even if it were not absolutely
    necessary for my health - as I have somewhat got my hearings
    here. Though it is not cheap considering what one gets for it -
    but change is always injurious to painting, and therefore I am
    thinking strongly of staying - as I can work here very
    regularly, and for the rest the country here has not been
    painted yet, at least not much. For this is a part of the South
    no warmer than with us, and the other painters usually go
    somewhat farther on, to Nice or so.</p>

    <p>It is important news that Aunt is no longer at Prinsenhage,
    but at any rate she did the right thing in getting rid of Jakob
    and the others, for in fact they seemed to be the real
    proprietors of the whole establishment, which was considerably
    more than human nature could bear.</p>

    <p>Such things belong among the queer occurrences in life,
    which one can't make head nor tail of as far as understanding
    the reason goes. Well, at any rate I think she is quite right -
    and yet I think she was attached to Prinsenhage, and will
    remain so for a long time to come. And attachment to things is
    part of our nature, and others can hardly take it away from
    us.</p>

    <p>And now I say goodbye for today. Thanks for the news about
    Cor - embraced in thought,</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
