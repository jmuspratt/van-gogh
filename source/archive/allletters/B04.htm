  <body>
    <p>My dear comrade Bernard,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for the sonnets you sent me; I very much like
    the form and the sonorous melody of the first one:</p>

    <p>Sous les d&ocirc;mes dormeurs des arbres
    gigantesques<i>.</i></p>

    <p>[Beneath the sleeping domes of the gigantic trees.]</p>

    <p>However, with regard to idea and sentiment it may be that I
    prefer the last one:</p>

    <p>Car J'espoir dans mon sein a vers&eacute; sa
    n&eacute;vrose.</p>

    <p>[For hope has poured into my breast its neurosis.]</p>

    <p>But it seems to me that you do not say clearly enough what
    you want to make felt - the certainty that one seems to have,
    and which one can in any case prove, of the nothingness, the
    emptiness, the betrayal of the desirable good and beautiful
    things; and that, despite this knowledge, one lets oneself be
    eternally fooled by the charm which external life, the things
    outside ourselves, exercises on our six senses, as if one did
    not know anything, and especially not the difference between
    objectivity and subjectivity. Fortunately for us we remain
    stupid and hopeful in this way.</p>

    <p>Now I also like:</p>

    <p>L'hiver, n'avoir ni sou, ni fleurs -</p>

    <p>[Winter, having neither a sou nor flowers - ]</p>

    <p>and &ldquo;M&eacute;pris.&rdquo; [Contempt.]</p>

    <p>I think &ldquo;Coin de chapelle&rdquo; [Corner of a Chapel]
    and &ldquo;Dessin d'Albrecht D&uuml;rer&rdquo; less clear; for
    instance, which exactly is the drawing by Albrecht D&uuml;rer?
    But nevertheless there are excellent passages in it:</p>

    <p>Venus des plaines bleues</p>

    <p>Blemis par la longueur des lieues.</p>

    <p>[Come from the blue plains,</p>

    <p>Paled by the length of the leagues.]</p>

    <p>renders very smartly the landscapes bristling with blue
    rocks, between which the roads meander, as in the backgrounds
    of Cranach and Van Eyck.</p>

    <p>Tordu sur sa croix en spirale</p>

    <p>[Twisted on his spiralled cross]</p>

    <p>conveys very well the exaggerated leanness of the mystic
    Christs. But why not add that the anguished look of the martyr
    is, like the eye of a cab horse, infinitely sad; that would
    make it more Parisian of Paris, where one sees such looks in
    the eyes of the superannuated nags of the little carriages as
    well as in those of the poets, artists.</p>

    <p>In short it is not as good as your painting yet; never mind,
    it will come; you must certainly continue your sonnets. There
    are so many people, especially among our comrades, who imagine
    that words are nothing - on the contrary, isn't it true that
    saying a thing well is as interesting and as difficult as
    painting it? There is the art of lanes and colours, but the art
    of words is there nonetheless, and will remain.</p>

    <p>[<art id=579_V-B_B040>Vincent sketched Orchard in Blossom here.</art>]</p>

    <p>Here is another orchard, rather simple as a composition: <art id=0406>a
    white tree, a small green tree, a square patch of green, lilac
    soil, an orange roof, a large blue sky</art>. I am
    working on nine orchards: one white; one pink, almost red; one
    white-blue; one grayish pink; one green and pink. Yesterday I
    overdid one [canvas] of a cherry tree against a blue sky; the
    young leaf shoots were orange and gold, the clusters of flowers
    white, and that against the green-blue of the sky was
    wonderfully glorious. Unfortunately there is rain today which
    prevents my returning to the charge.</p>

    <p>I saw a brothel here last Sunday - not counting the other
    days - a large room, the walls covered with blued whitewash -
    like a village school. Fifty or more military men in red and
    civilians in black their faces a magnificent yellow or orange
    (what hues there are in the faces here), the women in sky blue,
    in vermilion, as unqualified and garish as possible. The whole
    in a yellow light. A good deal less gloomy than the same
    kind of offices in Paris.</p>

    <p>There is no &ldquo;spleen&rdquo; <sup>1</sup> in the air
    here.</p>

    <p><label content="health.gastrointestinal">For the moment I am still lying low and keeping
    very quiet, for first of all I must recover from a stomach disorder of
    which I am the happy owner,</label> but after that I shall have to make
    a lot of noise, as I aspire to share the glory of the immortal
    Tartarin de Tarascon.</p>

    <p>I was enormously interested to hear that you intend to spend
    your time [as a soldier] in Algeria. That is perfect, and quite
    far from being a misfortune. Really, I congratulate you on it;
    at any rate we shall see each other in Marseilles.</p>

    <p>You will see how delighted you will be with seeing the blue
    here and with feeling the sun. At present I have a terrace for
    a studio.</p>

    <p>I certainly intend to go do seascapes at Marseilles too; I
    don't yearn for the grey sea of the North. If you see Gauguin,
    remember me most kindly to him. I must write to him right
    now.</p>

    <p>My dear comrade Bernard, don't despair and above all don't
    have <i>spleen,</i> old fellow, for with your talent and
    with your stay in Algeria you will turn out a wonderfully good
    and true artist. You too will belong to the South. If I have
    any advice to give you it is to fortify yourself to eat healthy
    things, yes, a full year in advance - from now on - <label content="health.general">for it
    won't do to come here with a damaged stomach and deteriorated
    blood.</p>

    <p>This was the case with me, and although I am recovering, I
    am recovering slowly, and I regret not having been a bit more
    careful beforehand. </label>But not such a damnable winter as the past
    one - what was there to be done? - for it was a superhuman
    winter.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">So get your blood in good condition in advance; here, with
    the bad food, it is difficult to pull through, but once one is
    in good health again it is less difficult to remain so than in
    Paris.</label> Write to me soon, always the same address:
    &ldquo;Restaurant Carrel, Arles.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>A handshake,</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
