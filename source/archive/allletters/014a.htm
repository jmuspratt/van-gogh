    <p>[To the Van Stockum - Haanebeek family]</p>

    <p>Dear Carolien and Willem,</p>

    <p>Hearty congratulations.</p>

    <p>I am afraid you are disappointed at not hearing from me
    sooner, but that's how I am, and you know that I mean well. But
    now you must return good for evil, and let me know at once how
    you are.</p>

    <p>Now I have something new to tell you; perhaps our Anna will
    come here. You can well imagine how wonderful this would be for
    me. It is almost too good to be true. Well, we'll have to wait
    and see. If she comes, it will probably be in May; and perhaps
    it might be arranged for me to go and bring her back.<label content="attitude.family"> I am
    longing to be closer to her than I am now. We have hardly seen
    each other once these last few years, and we only half know
    each other.</label></p>

    <p>The best of luck to you, greetings to all in the Poten, and
    to anyone who asks after me.</p>

    <p>Have you kept up your acquaintance with the Tersteeg
    family?</p>

    <p>Yours truly, Vincent</p>
  </body>
