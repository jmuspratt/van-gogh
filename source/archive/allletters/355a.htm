  <body>
    <p>Theo,</p>

    <p>Although I appreciate your proposal to add to the monthly
    sum of 100 francs, requested by me, 50 francs monthly by way of
    compensation to Father for my living expenses at home, I most
    decidedly <i>decline</i> this (the 50 francs, I mean).</p>

    <p>You may look upon my having been at home so long without
    paying for my board as arrogance or indiscretion on my part. I
    did this for the sake of my progress in painting, and have not
    profited from it personally, inasmuch as I still have to pay a
    rather heavy bill for colours, an extra expense. <i>For the
    rest, I acknowledge that after all it has been advantageous to
    me</i>. The reason why I cannot regard the present moment as
    propitious for making a kind of contract with Father is that
    under the circumstances it <i>cannot</i> be my intention to
    stay here much longer. Which I should very much like to do, but
    I am afraid it will prove impossible. If, however, you should
    want to make an arrangement with Father of the kind indicated
    in your letter, <i>then leave me out of it</i> - in other
    words, let it be purely a matter between you and Father, in
    which I am not involved.</p>

    <p>So that <i>I</i> for my part may go on considering it an
    <i>indiscretion in any case</i>, I mean the fact that I live
    here, also if you should make a payment.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">As soon as I am well again, I shall probably go and live in
    the studio, at least in the daytime.</p>

    <p>It is too much for me to lose you to a certain extent, and
    to have to pay for my board besides. Gradually I shall try to
    find other resources of my own. If it gives you any
    satisfaction to know that what you call &ldquo;my plans for the
    future&rdquo; have practically fallen through, thrive on the
    thought. But this is no reason for me to approve of your views,
    so that I am forced to repeat that <i>I continue to think them
    bad</i>. I cannot give up the studio, I must have some fixed
    place to work in, and in no event can they demand that I leave
    the village. However, my having to expect this, and my having
    to be prepared for it, is the cause of <i>my regretting the
    fact that I did not already see last year that our arrangement
    was untenable for both of us</i>.</p>

    <p>Goodbye.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I must protest against the underlined expression in your
    letter, which I copy: &ldquo;and I therefore request you to
    accept the 150 francs, which I shall go on sending you,
    <i>according to our agreement when we were good friends</i>,
    and to give 50 francs to Father, <i>which we both approved
    of</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I <i>protest against this</i>: it is not true that
    &ldquo;<i>when we were good friends</i>&rdquo; it was agreed
    upon between us that I should pay 50 francs. I clearly remember
    the conversation - <i>in the garden</i> - about this matter,
    and far from agreeing to anything, I <i>did not want</i> to
    make any agreement in this direction on that occasion, and the
    upshot was that I pointed out rather emphatically that I wanted
    money in order to undertake a number of larger canvases I had
    in mind, and that I had expenses enough besides. If anything
    was agreed upon, it was meant for later, when I should be in a
    more favourable position.</p>

    <p>This letter is meant to tell you explicitly that I utterly
    refuse to have anything to do with any agreement you might make
    with Father on the possible payment of board.</p>

    <p>In order to obviate any misunderstanding as to the payment
    of 50 francs for board, I let Father read your today's letter
    and this one. I do not want to hear anything further about this
    affair; settle it with Father. I say once again that <i>it is
    not true that I agreed to pay 50 francs for board</i> - if I
    had agreed to, I should have kept my promise, but I remember
    the whole conversation about it, and it's simply the opposite
    of what I told you - namely that for the time being I had to
    pay for so many other things that I <i>could not</i> do it
    yet.</p>

    <p>If I should drop dead - <i>which I should not try to evade
    if it happened, but which I should not seek expressly</i> - you
    would be standing on a skeleton, and this would be a damned
    insecure standpoint. As long, however, as I am alive and
    painting, well, you may expect a feeling of gratitude and of
    obligation from me - but - seeing that I feel that I must carry
    on my work vigorously, and that otherwise I shall not be able
    to stick it out, I dare speak to you about what is wrong. If
    you did not listen to this at the time, and after that began to
    think ill of me - it may well be that this feeling was not
    analyzed incorrectly by you - and might really have been a
    presentiment of something that - <i>not through any fault of
    mine, but in consequence of your own act and state of mind</i>
    - might come to pass, and that we should do well to avoid, very
    much so. Let's separate, old fellow, for a time, as friends,
    that will do no harm, neither to you nor to me. Staying
    together would end badly if things went on like this.</p>

    <p>I dare say, if you were to make a more correct analysis of
    your own feelings, what you call &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo; may
    really have been something quite different. I mean a kind of
    presentiment that something was going to happen between you and
    me - and that otherwise things would not go well. You are in an
    elevated position, but this is no reason for being suspicious
    of those who are standing on low ground --where I stand - and
    where I intend to say.</p>
