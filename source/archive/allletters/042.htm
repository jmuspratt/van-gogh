  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter I received this morning. This time, I
    would like to write you in a way I seldom do. I propose in
    particular to tell you in detail how I live here.</p>

    <p>As you know, I live in Montmartre. In the same building a
    young Englishman has his lodging, he is also employed at the
    store. He is 18 years old; he is the son of a London dealer of
    paintings. He had never left his paternal home before he came
    here, and he was very rough-hewn during the first weeks of his
    stay. He eats six to eight sous worth of bread morning noon and
    night (N.B. bread sold in Paris is very good) and supplements
    his meals with several pounds of apples or pears. He is as
    skinny as a toothpick, he has two rows of solid teeth, big red
    lips, twinkling eyes, a pair of big ears which stick out from
    his head, a razor-cut pate (black hair), etc. At first
    everybody laughed at this young chap, even I. But bit by bit I
    grew to like him, and I assure you that at the moment I am glad
    to have his company in the evenings.</p>

    <p>He has a na&iuml;ve and unspoiled heart and he is very good
    at his work at the store. Every evening, we go home together,
    we eat a little in my room, and then I read aloud, every
    evening, mostly from the Bible. We would like to read it from
    one end to the other. In the mornings, usually between five and
    six, he comes to wake me up, we have breakfast together in my
    room, and we leave about 8 for the store.</p>

    <p>Lately, he is eating a bit more reasonably and he is now
    collecting prints, which I am helping him to do.</p>

    <p>Yesterday we went to Luxembourg together, and I showed him
    the pictures that I like the most. In truth, the simple people
    know things better than the intelligent ones.</p>

    <p>Also the picture (I cannot recall the name) of a convent
    where the monks receive a stranger and suddenly perceive that
    it is Jesus. On the wall of the convent is written, &ldquo;Man
    proposes and God disposes,&rdquo; &ldquo;He that receiveth you
    receiveth me, he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent
    me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>At the store, I do all the work that is given into my hands.
    Old son, we do this work all our lives, give me the power to
    consecrate my strength.</p>

    <p>Did you do what I advised you to do, get rid of the works of
    Michelet, Renan, etc.? I think this would give you peace of
    mind. However, do not forget the piece by Michelet about the
    woman's portrait by Ph. De Champaigne; similarly, do not forget
    Renan. But throw away their works. &ldquo;If you have found
    honey, mind that you do not eat too much, and become
    disgusted&rdquo;, you read in the book of Proverbs, or
    somewhere like that. Do you know Erckmann-Chatrian:<i> Le
    Conscrit, Waterloo,</i> and most of all <i>L'Ami Fritz </i>and
    <i>Madame Th&eacute;r&egrave;se?</i> Read these works, if you
    can find them. A change of diet stimulates the appetite
    (provided that we take care to look for a <i>plain</i> food,
    because it is not written for nothing: Give us this day our
    daily bread), and the bow cannot always be kept bent.</p>

    <p>I hope you will pardon my telling you these things. I know
    you are intelligent enough to find them out for yourself. Don't
    find <i>everything</i> all right. Learn to distinguish for
    yourself between what is relatively good and <i>evil</i>, and
    let that feeling show you the way under God's guidance, for
    boy, we need God's guidance so much. Look for light and
    freedom, and <i>do not ponder too deeply over the evils of the
    world</i>.</p>

    <p>Write again soon and in a little more detail. My compliments
    to everybody, especially to Mr. Tersteeg and family, and be as
    happy as you can. &Agrave; Dieu, believe me always,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
