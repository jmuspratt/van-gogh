  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I just received your letter, for which I thank you. Once
    again I am pleased to see from it that you enjoy the wood
    engravings. Furthermore I respect your point of view with
    regard to what I sent you now and then, something I hope to go
    on doing unless you should object. But I am confronted with a
    difficult problem, which I can't really solve, though I am
    going to anyway, namely telling you what I have paid for them.
    As you know, I have a special penchant for wood engravings.
    Usually I buy them very cheap, yet I spend rather much on them,
    considering my circumstances - although I have never regretted
    it. But whether I paid much or little for them is a question
    entirely of what I sent you, for I sent you duplicates, and not
    one that I did not have myself - you saw that for yourself last
    summer, when we sorted out the duplicates.</p>

    <p>What I sent you I did not buy expressly for you - with a few
    exceptions, and I spent very little money on these few, and I
    only wish I could find more of them. But as you insist on it, I
    shall charge you, let us say, a <i>daalder</i> [1.50 guilders]
    for them, which you can remit any time, for instance in stamps,
    and then you need no longer have any pangs of conscience about
    having injured me financially.</p>

    <p>So I think that question is settled.</p>

    <p>Now I have asked you to let me know if you are receiving
    regularly magazines such as L'Illustration and the Graphic - I
    mean the current issues. I mention this because I am
    negotiating with a man who has a number of magazines from a
    public library for sale. I have decided to take them in any
    case, but I have some of the current year already, so I shall
    probably get some more duplicates. For example, if these are
    from L'Illustration and I know you have them already, I want to
    give them to someone else who might like them and is collecting
    them (although for the moment I don't know of anyone). But if
    I know you do not have them, they are yours of course.</p>

    <p>Even before I received your letter I agreed to take the lot
    - so please let me know how you stand with regard to current
    magazines.</p>

    <p>Of course I don't know whether I'll have a small or large
    number of duplicates, but at any rate there will be some, I
    think. So <i>please let me know</i><i>.</i> If it amounts to
    anything, I will charge you something for it, or we can make an
    arrangement some time or other, but let me know if I can be of
    use to you in this respect. I am greatly interested in your
    collection, and I should like to see it become a very beautiful
    one. Perhaps I shall be able to send you more important things
    later on.</p>

    <p>I already have forty larger and smaller sheets by Renouard.
    For instance, I found some time ago his &ldquo;La Bourse&rdquo;
    [The Exchange] and &ldquo;Un Discours de M. Gambetta,&rdquo;
    and also sheets called &ldquo;Enfants assist&eacute;s.&rdquo;
    But I am sure you will be delighted with some large
    Lan&ccedil;ons.</p>

    <p>Caton Woodville too is very clever; the more I see of his
    work, the better I like it.</p>

    <p>Do you know Monthard? - I think that at any rate you have
    some of his landscapes - well, a short while ago I got some
    sketches of his from Ireland and also from Jersey, in which
    there was a great deal of sentiment.</p>

    <p>I sincerely hope you will derive pleasure from your picture
    at &ldquo;Arti&rdquo;; I don't think I shall see this
    exhibition.</p>

    <p>I am very busy working on drawings of an
    <i>orphan</i>-man<i>,</i> as these poor old fellows from the
    workhouse are popularly called here. Don't you think the
    expressions &ldquo;<i>orphan</i>-man&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;<i>orphan</i>-woman&rdquo; characteristic? It is not
    easy to do those characters one is always meeting in the
    streets.</p>

    <p>As for watercolours, I have started several, but I have not
    been as successful with them as I should wish, although I enjoy
    doing them more than formerly. Herewith another rough sketch of
    an <i>orphan</i>-man<i>.</i> Adieu, I am writing in haste -
    please let me know soon how you stand with regard to those wood
    engravings <sup>1</sup> - whether you have them or not.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

        <p>Vincent regularly uses the Dutch word for
        &ldquo;woodcuts,&rdquo; but he usually means wood
        engravings.</p>
