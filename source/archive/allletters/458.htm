  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I write you once more because at all events my time here has
    almost come to an end, and I have to go back one of these days.
    The time of working out-of-doors will be there at the slightest
    change in the weather, so if it must be, and if you wish it, my
    being in Brabant would not be quite futile. But however this
    may be, I continue to try to induce you to carry out the Cormon
    plan, and I personally would so much prefer to go on drawing
    from the casts for a time.</p>

    <p><label content="health.gastrointestinal">I guess my health is improving a little, at least in that I
    can digest my food a little better. But it always remains
    unsteady, and it varies from one day to the next. </label>I have
    finished another drawing from a cast, and since I wrote you
    that the teacher had let me know indirectly that it had not
    been his intention to offend me, there has been no further
    trouble between us, and he even said that today's drawing
    hardly needed any correction of the proportions, and none at
    all of the tone. So I almost dare to hope that I shall also
    manage to get along with Cormon, whatever he may be like, and
    that makes me long the more to be there. Well, if I may have
    some luck with my health, I hope to make some progress this
    year.</p>

    <p>I also continue to believe that I shall be able to find some
    work, though I have not been lucky in that respect.</p>

    <p>But my time has been taken up almost completely by my work
    at the academy.</p>

    <p>From what I hear, I infer that what the fellows happen to
    sell is always portraits. There is said to be a fine exhibition
    of impressionists in Brussels.</p>

    <p>You see, since I have heard and seen here how the other
    fellows who concentrate on the figure manage - and you see
    they all have more to spend than I - they have always made use
    of models at some studio in the city, just to save expenses.
    And at the same time one has some intercourse with other
    fellows, and can see how they work.</p>

    <p>And I can't help thinking all the time that perhaps we ought
    to have taken that measure two or two and a half years ago -
    that much more reason not to put it off any longer now.</p>

    <p>After all Antwerp has pleased me very much. Of course I wish
    I had arrived here with the experience I have now, at the
    moment I leave. But if that were possible, things would be
    easier, and one always begins everywhere by being a greenhorn.
    But I hope to come back to Antwerp some time, for life is
    rather free and artistic here, if only one looks for it, more
    than anywhere else perhaps.</p>

    <p>Then one sees all kinds of people, English, French, German
    and Belgian, and that gives variation.</p>

    <p>If there is one city that resembles Paris, it is Antwerp
    rather than Brussels, in the first place because it is a centre
    for people of all nationalities, secondly, with regard to
    business, and in the third place because of its liveliness, and
    of the fact that one can amuse oneself there.</p>

    <p>If the course at the academy continues, I should like to
    stay, but unfortunately from May on there is nothing but
    competitions, and the day class for the works of the ancients,
    and these are also almost over.</p>

    <p>And now I have not seen Antwerp in a flourishing condition,
    for one generally hears that it used to be much livelier, and
    that now it is depressed by two crises at the same time - in
    the first place the general one, and then in addition, the
    afterpains of the exhibition in the shape of numbers of
    fraudulent or common bankruptcies.</p>

    <p>Think it over carefully again, whether we can't find a
    combination that would render it possible for me to come to
    Paris before June. I should like it so much, because I believe
    it would be better for so many reasons, which I have already
    mentioned to you. To which I may add that I think we can
    discuss taking a studio by June so much better if we are both
    in Paris beforehand, and can investigate the pros and
    cons.</p>

    <p>Well, write me soon. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
