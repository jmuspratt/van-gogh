  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You will already have received my letter of this morning, in
    which I enclosed the 50-fr. note for Bing, and there is still
    more I want to write you about this Bing business! The point is
    that we do not know enough about Japanese prints.</p>

    <p>Fortunately we know more about the Japanese of France, the
    impressionists.</p>

    <p>So Japanese art proper, already interred in collections,
    already impossible to find in Japan itself, is becoming of
    secondary interest.</p>

    <p>But that doesn't mean that if I had a single day to see
    Paris again, I should not call at Bing's to see those very
    Hokusais and other drawings of the great period. Besides, Bing
    himself used to say to me, when I was admiring the ordinary
    prints, that after a while I should come to see that there are
    quite different things still.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Loti's book Mme. Crysanth&egrave;me taught me this much: the
    rooms there are bare, without decoration or ornaments. And that
    very thing wakened my interest in the excessively synthetic
    drawings of another period, which probably are to our prints
    what a sober Millet is to a Monticelli. You know well enough
    that I do not dislike Monticelli. Nor colour prints either,
    even when I am told, &ldquo;You must get out of the habit of
    that.&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>But at the stage we have reached, it seems to me very
    essential for us to recognise that sober quality which is the
    equivalent of the colourless Millets. That has little or
    nothing to do with the stock proper, which can quite well stay
    as it is. For I never tire of the figures and landscapes. And
    there are so many!</p>

    <p>If I was not caught and absorbed in my work, how I should
    love to sell the whole pile. There isn't much to be made out of
    it. That's why no one takes it up. Nevertheless, in a few years
    all these prints will become very rare, and will bring higher
    prices. That's why we must not undervalue the small advantage
    we have now in rummaging through thousands of them to make our
    choice.</p>

    <p>So now if you give a whole Sunday to it, and choose a 100
    francs' worth of stock, you can tell yourself beforehand that
    you will not sell them, having chosen them yourself, unless
    they displease you. You can pay for them in installments,
    always filling in the gaps - and when the lot is finally paid
    for, you will still have as many more in stock. And the result
    will be that <i>whatever we like most</i> out of the bunch
    <i>will stay in our hands</i>. That is how it has come about
    that there are a good many old prints, already well worth a
    franc apiece, in what you actually have at the moment.</p>

    <p>So please hang on to the stock and do not get rid of any
    fine prints - for that matter it would pay us better to get
    more. We already have some prints that are certainly worth 5
    francs. Lord, I could not do as I liked, for I was as
    enthusiastic over that heap of 10,000 prints to rummage in as
    Thor&eacute; was over a sale of Dutch pictures, with
    interesting ones among them. My Lord, my work has pretty well
    got hold of me now, and I myself can do no more in that field,
    but let me commend that attic of Bing's to your attention.</p>

    <p>I learned there myself, and I made Anquetin and Bernard
    learn there too. Now there is still something <i>to learn</i>
    at Bing's, and that is why I strongly advise you to hang on to
    your stock and our right to inspect the attic and cellars, and
    you will see how far I am from seeing it as a speculation.
    <i>Suppose</i> it does cost something (I myself do not think
    that we shall lose on it), it will not be anything
    tremendous.</p>

    <p>Whatever is Reid doing??? Perhaps he has been there already
    on his own account, as well as Russell. I did not conceal the
    fact there were some at Bing's, only I said that they were 5
    sous, which Bing himself had told me, or rather the manager. If
    you keep the stock, tell the latter again that we often send
    people direct to him, but that he must keep his prints at the
    stated price - 5 sous - not less.</p>

    <p>I only tell you this because I have rummaged in the heap
    four or five times, the prints at home are the result of a
    stock already several times renewed.</p>

    <p>Let's go on in the same way. It has already caused me much
    regret, knowing something of the heap, that I did not pay on
    New Year's Day and choose the new stock myself. Because there
    are so many one gets confused.</p>

    <p>And there isn't the same stuff in the other shops, because
    people are afraid to go to Bing, thinking him expensive. The
    place where I haven't hunted is the <i>Library</i>, where there
    are hundreds, thousands of bound books.</p>

    <p>Look here, the best thing you can do is to go and see the
    manager - I still cannot remember his name - give him my
    profound apologies please, but tell him that I went three times
    on New Year's Day to settle up, and that after that I went
    South.</p>

    <p>Then that will get you a Claude Monet and other pictures,
    because if you take the trouble to ferret out the prints, you
    have a perfect right to use them as exchanges with painters for
    their pictures.</p>

    <p>But to wind up our connection with Bing, oh never! Japanese
    art is a thing like the Primitives, like the Greeks, like our
    old Dutchmen, Rembrandt, Potter, Hals, Van der Meer, Ostade,
    Ruysdael. <i>They never pass away</i>.</p>

    <p>If, however, I were seeing Bing's manager, I should tell him
    that when we give ourselves the trouble of finding purchasers
    for his prints, a whole day is gone before we know it, and at
    the end of it all, whether we sell or not, we lose money on it.
    And as for yourself, if you don't want to lose on it, I advise
    you to make some exchange with the painters you know; Bernard
    still owes you a study, to tell the truth.</p>

    <p>But it's all to be expected, and the difficulty of working
    in Paris! Today I sent six drawings after painted studies to
    Bernard. I have promised him six more, and I have asked for
    some sketches after his painted studies in exchange.</p>

    <p>And so here's General Boulanger up to his tricks again. Both
    sides, it seems to me, had reason enough to fight, seeing that
    they couldn't agree. And anyhow, at least this way there won't
    be any stagnation, and they can't help but get something out of
    it, both sides. Don't you think he speaks very badly? -
    Boulanger, I mean: he can make no impression speaking at all. I
    do not think the less of him for that, since he is in the habit
    of using his voice for practical purposes, for explaining
    things to the officers or to the arsenal superintendents. But
    he makes no impression whatever in public. All the same, it's a
    queer city, Paris, where you can only live by spilling your
    guts, and where you can do nothing or even less as long as you
    are not half dead.</p>

    <p>I have just read Victor Hugo's L'Ann&eacute;e Terrible.
    There is hope there, but&hellip; that hope is in the stars. I
    think it is true, and well told, and beautiful, and indeed I
    should be glad to believe it myself. But don't lets forget that
    this earth is a planet too, and consequently a star, or
    celestial orb. And if all the other stars were the same!!! That
    would not be much fun; nothing for it but to begin all over
    again. But in art, for which one needs <i>time</i>, it would
    not be bad to live more than one life. And it is rather
    attractive to think of the Greeks, the old Dutch masters, and
    the Japanese continuing their glorious school on other orbs.
    There, that's enough for today.</p>

    <p>Well, here's another Sunday got through, writing you and
    writing Bernard. I must say, however, I haven't found it
    long.</p>

    <p>A handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>If our sisters could again bring us some wood engravings and things
    like the Gavarni's Human Masquerade,100 lithographs,
    and the Charles Keenes, of which there are at least 200, it
    would not be a bad idea. Also there is a very fine book,
    Anatomy for Artists!</p>
