  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo, I want you to hear from me soon again. Yesterday
    I had a good letter from Etten, from which I learned that you
    had already been there and are expected back Saturday night to
    spend Sunday at home also; probably you are there at this
    moment, and it will be a good Sunday.</p>

    <p>This morning I was at early service in the North Church.
    Afterward I just took a walk through the city, the canals are
    especially beautiful now that the leaves of the trees have
    their autumn hues. Then I went to the English church and heard
    a very good sermon on, &ldquo;Take no thought, saying, what
    shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or wherewith shall we be
    clothed, etc. [see Matt. 6:25; Luke 12:22].</p>

    <p>I love that little church, and probably many a person there
    has memories of things and places which are known to me, also.
    Have you ever seen or read a book by Esquiros, Life in England
    (or England and the English Life)? I haven't, but I think it
    must be an interesting book.</p>

    <p>When you have a chance, don't forget that fragment by Jules
    Breton and that other one by Michelet.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">Did you have a good journey? Let me hear from you soon. It
    was a delightful surprise when you came here that evening (N.B.
    the young woman at the station had already been wondering about
    our hurried departure). It was nice that we saw Mauve there
    too.</p>

    <p>After coming home I sat up working a long time. That is
    already a week ago now, the days fly by.</label></p>

    <p>How beautiful that engraving after Ary Scheffer, &ldquo;The
    Holy Women at the Tomb of Christ,&rdquo; is - I am so glad I
    have it. The old woman especially is splendid.</p>

    <p>Have you got something new for your collection? Go on with
    it, for it is a good thing.</p>

    <p>This morning I saw the Minister of Marine, Taalman Kip, who
    visited Uncle and lunched here; how much character is in that
    face and in those grey eyes - he reminded me of old Mr. Goupil
    or somebody like Guizot.</p>

    <p>I do not know why, but for a whole week I have been thinking
    of that picture and the etching after it, &ldquo;A Young
    Citizen of the Year V&rdquo; by Jules Goupil. I saw the picture
    in Paris, indescribably beautiful and unforgettable. The many
    pictures about the days of the Revolution - for instance,
    &ldquo;The Girondins&rdquo; and &ldquo;Last Victims of the
    Terror&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marie Antoinette&rdquo; by Delaroche,
    and that &ldquo;Young Citizen&rdquo; and other pictures by
    Goupil, and the ones by Anker and so many others - what a
    beautiful unity they form, together with books like those by
    Michelet, Carlyle, and also Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities. In
    all of them there is something of the spirit of the
    resurrection and the life - that lives though it seems dead,
    for it is not dead, but sleepeth.</p>

    <p>I should like to read more widely, but I must not; in fact,
    I need not wish it so much, for all things are in the word of
    Christ - more perfect and more beautiful than in any other
    book.</p>

    <p>That etching by Jules Goupil was hanging in my room in
    London for a long time, in the days when I was so full of
    Michelet and other French authors; I think Harry Gladwell has
    it now. I had a short note from him after he arrived back in
    Paris. On a day like this I should like to walk again with him
    in the twilight, along the Seine, around Notre Dame. Paris is
    so enchantingly beautiful in autumn, and that spot above all.
    How pretty the winter chrysanthemums will be in the little
    gardens in London - they continue to bloom there all the winter
    through.</p>

    <p>Have you planned this winter to read any books,
    &ldquo;co&ucirc;te que co&ucirc;te&rdquo;? Sometimes it is
    right to carry a thing through and to do it with a will. Uncle
    Jan has also read widely, and there is much that is fine in
    him. A spiritual affinity and an attachment and love like that
    between Father and Uncle is a good fruit of life. Though the
    fire may occasionally merely smoulder because of the pressure
    of daily cares and troubles, sometimes it flares brightly and
    brilliantly and gloriously - for instance, as it did that
    evening last winter when those two went to the Hoeve
    together.</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    De top van de Hekla is wit van sneeuw,<br>

    Maar `t vuur in zijn binnenst gloeit eeuw na eeuw.<br>

    Gij, schoon het winter op `t grijzend hoofd,<br>

    De liefde, Gods vlam, is in `t hart niet verdooft.<br>

    <p></p>

    [The top of the Helka is white with snow,<br>

    But the fire within her glows century after century.<br>

    Although it be winter on thy greying head,<br>

    Love, the flame of God, is not extinguished in thy
    heart.]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>We have seen what this means, and we know something about
    it. Such a fire of spirit and love is a force of God's opposed
    to the dark and evil and terrible things of the world and the
    dark side of life; it is a force of resurrection stronger than
    any act and a ray of hope which gives consciousness and
    security to the depths and the secret of the heart. It is
    expressed in words which are simple but eloquent, &ldquo;I
    never despair.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, boy, I have still some work to do and must wind this
    up. Have a good time, try to find something in art and in
    books; it is written, &ldquo;Seek and ye shall find,&rdquo;
    and, &ldquo;He who needeth wisdom, desireth it from God.&rdquo;
    And that is what we need.</p>

    <p>How is Carolien? Remember me to her and also to the Roos
    family, and Mauve and Tersteeg if you meet them; a warm
    handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>The portrait of Johan van Gogh reminds one a little of the
    &ldquo;Young Citizen.&rdquo; It makes me think of
    &ldquo;sorrowful yet always rejoicing,&rdquo; a quality one can
    find in many things.</p>
