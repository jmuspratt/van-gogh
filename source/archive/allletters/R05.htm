  <body>
    <p>Dear Rappard,</p>

    <p>To talk less abstractly this time, I am going to discuss
    some facts with you. You say that Ten Cate spoke to you about
    similar matters as I did. All right, but if this Mr. Ten Cate
    is the same person whom on a certain day I saw in your studio
    for a moment, I very much doubt whether he and l have exactly
    the same ideas fundamentally. Is he a man of small stature with
    black or at least dark hair, who on that occasion had a very
    pale complexion, or at any rate was very neatly dressed in a
    suit of black cloth? You should know that I am in the habit of
    observing very accurately the physical exteriors of people in
    order to get at their real mental make-up. However, I saw this
    Mr. Ten Cate only once, and that very fleetingly - at least if
    I saw him at all - and so I cannot make up my mind about him.
    All the same, it is possible that in some respects he spoke to
    you as I did, and I don't object to that - all the better, I
    say. Actually your answer to my letter is no more than half an
    answer, thanks all the same. I think you will tell me the other
    half some time, but not in the near future. The other half,
    still to come, will be longer than the one I received, <i>and
    much more satisfactory</i><i>.</i></p>

    <p>Suppose at some time you leave the academy for good then I
    think that you will eventually have to struggle against a very
    peculiar difficulty, which is not quite unknown to you even
    now. A man who, like you, is working at the academy regularly
    cannot help feeling more or less out of his element when,
    instead of knowing, This or that is my task for today, he is
    forced to improvise, or rather <i>create</i><i>,</i> his task
    every day anew. Especially in the long run this looking for and
    finding your work will not prove such an easy job by any means.
    At least it would not surprise me if, after having broken away
    from the academy for good, you did not occasionally feel that
    the ground was giving way under your feet. But I think you are
    not the kind of man to be thrown into a panic by such a natural
    phenomenon, and you will soon regain your balance.</p>

    <p>However, when you have thrown yourself once and for all,
    headlong and without reservation into reality (for after you
    have thrown yourself into it, you will never go back), you will
    speak to others who are still clinging to the academy; exactly
    as Ten Cate does and exactly as I do. For from what you have
    told me Mr. Ten Cate I infer that his reasoning can be reduced
    to the following words: Rappard, give up your reservations, and
    throw yourself headlong into reality.</p>

    <p>The Open Sea is your true element and even at the academy
    you do not belie your true character and nature; that is why
    the worthy gentlemen there will not recognize you in fact, and
    put you off with idle talk.</p>

    <p>Mr. Ten Cate is not yet an able seaman, and I myself much
    less, and we cannot steer and manoeuver yet as we would like
    to; but if we do not get drowned or smashed on the rocks in the
    seething breakers, we shall become good sailors. There is no
    help for it, everyone has to go through a period of worrying
    and fumbling after he has risked himself on the open sea. At
    first we catch little or no fish, but we get acquainted with
    our course and learn to steer our little vessel, and this is
    indispensable to begin with. And after a while we shall catch a
    lot of fish, and big ones too, be sure of that!</p>

    <p>But I think Mr. Ten Cate is casting his nets for another
    kind of fish than I am, because to my mind our temperaments
    diverge; for every fisherman has a right to his own specialty,
    but now and then a fish of one kind will swim into the net
    meant for another kind, and vice versa, and so it may happen
    that at times there is a similarity between his catch and
    mine.</p>

    <p>Now from time to time you dislike sowers and seamstresses
    and diggers. Well, what of it? So do I. However, with me this
    &ldquo;disliking from time to time&rdquo; is far outweighed by
    a certain enthusiasm, but with you the two things seem to have
    equal weight.</p>

    <p>Have you kept my epistles? If you have a little time to
    spare, and they have not perished in the flames, then I say:
    read them again, although it may seem pretentious to ask such a
    thing of you. But I did not write them without serious
    intentions, though I was not afraid to speak my mind freely and
    to give free rein to my imagination. Now you say that I am a
    fanatic at heart, and that most certainly I am preaching a
    doctrine.</p>

    <p>Well, if you want to take it that way, so be it; when it
    comes to the point I don't object to it, I am not ashamed of my
    feelings, I do not blush to own that I am a man with principles
    and a creed. But where does my fanaticism seek to drive people,
    especially myself? To the open sea! And what is the doctrine I
    preach? My friends, let us give our souls to our cause, let us
    work with our heart, and truly love what we love.</p>

    <p><i>Love what we love</i><i>,</i> how superfluous a warning
    this seems to be, and yet it is justified to an enormous
    extent! For how many there are who waste their best efforts on
    something that is not worth their best efforts, whereas they
    treat what they love in a stepmotherly way instead of yielding
    wholly to the irresistible urge of their hearts. And yet we
    venture to call this conduct &ldquo;firmness of
    char-acter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;strength of mind,&rdquo; and we
    waste our energy on an unworthy creature, all the while
    neglecting our true sweetheart. And all this &ldquo;with the
    most sacred intentions,&rdquo; thinking &ldquo;we are compelled
    to do it,&rdquo; out of &ldquo;moral conviction&rdquo; and a
    &ldquo;Sense of duty.&rdquo; And so we have the &ldquo;beam in
    our own eye,&rdquo; confusing a pseudo- or would-be conscience
    with our true conscience. The person who at this moment is
    writing to his dear friend Rappard has been marching around on
    this earth with one, or even more than one, such object - but
    then of a monstrous size - in his eye for a long time.</p>

    <p>Has this beam been got rid of? you ask. Well, what can the
    present writer answer to this? Of <i>one</i> thing he is sure,
    namely that one very big beam is got rid of, provisionally;
    but, for the very reason that he did not notice it when he was
    labouring under it, he does not deem it impossible that there
    are others of whose existence or nonexistence he is not fully
    aware. However, the person in question has learned to be on his
    guard against diseases of and beams in the eyes. The
    excessively big beam in question was of a more or less
    inartistic char-acter. I won't tell you just now what kind of
    beam it was. For there are all kinds of eye beams, artistic,
    theological, moral eye beams (quite a multitude of them),
    practical eye beams and theoretical eye beams (sometimes the
    two are combined - <i>very ruinous indeed</i>!), and ... oh
    well, a lot more.</p>

    <p>We must not let ourselves be thrown into too much of a panic
    if we are not without them, provided this &ldquo;not being in a
    panic&rdquo; does not lead us into carelessness or indifference
    in this respect, or even into stubbornness.</p>

    <p>A few days ago I had a nice letter from my brother Theo, who
    also inquired after you; I had sent him some drawings, and he
    strongly advised me to go on with those Brabant types. What he
    says about art is always to the point and purpose, and he often
    gives hints that are practical and practicable.</p>

    <p>Today I have again been attacking a certain
    &ldquo;b&ecirc;te noire&rdquo; of mine, to wit, the system of
    resignation; I believe this &ldquo;b&ecirc;te noire&rdquo; is
    of the race of the hydra - that is to say the more serpent's
    heads you cut off, the more spring up again. And yet there have
    been men who have succeeded in killing off such a
    &ldquo;b&ecirc;te noir.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It is always my favorite occupation, as soon as I can find a
    spare half-hour, to resume the fight against this old
    &ldquo;b&ecirc;te noir.&rdquo; But perhaps you do not know that
    in theology there exists a system of resignation with
    mortification as a side branch. And if this were a thing that
    existed only in the imagination and the writings or sermons of
    the theologians, I should not take notice of it; but alas, it
    is one of those insufferable burdens which certain theologians
    lay on the shoulders of men, without touching them themselves
    with their little finger.</p>

    <p>And so - more's the pity - this resignation belongs to the
    domain of reality, and causes many great and petites
    mis&egrave;res de la vie humaine. But when they wanted to put
    this yoke upon my shoulders, I said, &ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo;
    And this they thought very disrespectful. Well, so be it.
    Whatever may be the raison d'&ecirc;tre of this resignation, it
    - the resignation, I mean - is only for those who <i>can</i> be
    resigned, and religious belief is for those who <i>can</i>
    believe. And what can I do if I am not cut out by nature for
    the former, i.e<i>.</i> resignation, but on the contrary for
    the latter, i.e. religious belief, with all its
    consequences?</p>

    <p>Well, if you have a little time to spare, write me again,
    and in the meantime believe me, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
