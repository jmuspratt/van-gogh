  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just sent off three big drawings, as well as some
    other ones, and the two lithographs by de Lemud.</p>

    <p>The <art id=1456>little cottage garden done vertically</art> is, I think, the
    best of the three big ones. The <art id=1457>one with the sunflowers is a
    little garden of a bathing establishment</art>, the <art id=1455>third garden,
    horizontal</art>, is the one from which I made <art id=0429>some painted studies</art>
    as well.</p>

    <p>Under the blue sky the orange, yellow, red splashes of the
    flowers take on an amazing brilliance, and in the limpid air
    there is a something or other happier, more lovely than in the
    North. It vibrates like the bouquet by Monticelli which you
    have. I reproach myself for not painting flowers here. And
    although I've knocked off some fifty drawings and painted
    studies here, I seem to have done absolutely nothing. I'd
    gladly content myself with being a pioneer for the other
    painters of the future who come to work in the South.</p>

    <p>Now the <art id=1485>Harvest</art>, the Garden,<art id=1441> the Sower</art>, and
    <art id=1430b>the </art>two <art id=1431>marines</art>
    are sketches after painted studies. I think that all these
    ideas are good, but the painted studies lack clearness of
    touch. That is another reason why I felt it necessary to draw
    them.</p>

    <p>I wanted to paint a poor old peasant, whose features bear a
    very strong resemblance to Father, only he is coarser,
    bordering on a caricature.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, I should have been very keen to do him exactly
    like the poor peasant that he is.</p>

    <p>He promised to come, and then he said that he wanted to have
    the picture for himself, so that I should have had to do two
    the same, one for him and one for myself. I said No. Perhaps he
    will come back someday.</p>

    <p>I am curious to hear if you knew the de Lemuds.</p>

    <p>At the moment there are still many fine lithographs to be
    had, Daumiers, reproductions after Delacroix, D&eacute;camps,
    Diaz, Rousseau, Dupr&eacute;, etc. But soon these will be
    exhausted, and what a great pity it is that this art tends to
    disappear.</p>

    <p>Why doesn't one hold what one has, like the doctors and the
    engineers; once a thing is discovered and invented, they retain
    the knowledge; in these wretched Fine Arts everything is
    forgotten, nothing is kept.</p>

    <p>Millet gave the synthesis of the peasant, and now, yes,
    there is Lhermitte, certainly there are a few others,
    <i>Meunier</i>&hellip;Then have we in general learned to see
    the peasant now? <i>No</i>, hardly anyone knows how to pull one
    off.</p>

    <p>Doesn't the fault really lie a little with Paris and the
    Parisians, changeable and faithless as the sea?</p>

    <p>Well, you have damn good reason to say: Let's go quietly on
    our way, working for ourselves. You know, whatever this
    sacrosanct impressionism may be, all the same I wish I could
    paint things that the generation <i>before</i> Delacroix,
    Millet, Rousseau, Diaz, Monticelli, Isabey, D&eacute;camps,
    Dupr&eacute;, Jongkind, Ziem, Isra&euml;ls, Meunier, a lot of
    others, Corot, Jacque, etc., could understand.</p>

    <p>Ah, Manet has come very near, very near to it, and Courbet,
    the wedding of form to colour. I would very much like to keep
    silent for ten years, doing nothing but studies, and then do
    one or two pictures of figures. The old plan, so often
    recommended, is so seldom put into practice.</p>

    <p>If the drawings I send you are too hard, it is because I
    have done them in such a way as to be able later on, if they're
    still around, to use them as guides for painting.</p>

    <p><art id=0430>The little cottage garden done vertically</art> has in itself
    amazing colours: the dahlias are a rich and sombre purple; the
    double row of flowers is pink and green on one side, and orange
    with hardly any leaves on the other. In the midst a white dwarf
    dahlia, and a little pomegranate with flowers of the most vivid
    reddish-orange, with yellowish-green fruits. The ground gray,
    the tall reeds, &ldquo;canes,&rdquo; blue-green, the fig trees
    emerald, the sky blue, the houses white with green windows and
    red roofs, in the morning full in the sunshine, in the evening
    drowned in the shadows thrown by the fig trees and the
    reeds.</p>

    <p>If only Quost were here, or Jeannin! What's to be done? To
    include it all requires a whole school of men working together
    in the same country, complementing one another like the old
    Dutchmen, portrait painters, &ldquo;genre&rdquo; painters,
    landscape, animal, still-life painters.</p>

    <p>Moreover I must tell you that I made a very interesting
    round of the farms with someone who knows the country. But you
    know in the real Provence there is more poor peasantry &agrave;
    la Millet than anything else.</p>

    <p>McKnight and Bock see nothing but the heat, or rather
    nothing at all. Now even if I begin to see things a little more
    clearly, it will take a very long stay to do them.</p>

    <p>At times, however, it seems likely that it is I who shall
    have to make the journey if Gauguin does not succeed in getting
    out of the mess and we want to carry out our plan. Well then,
    so be it, I shall be among peasants just the same, it's all
    one. I should even advise our trying to hold ourselves in
    readiness to go to him, for I think that soon he may find
    himself in terrible trouble again, for instance if his landlord
    is not willing to give him any more credit. That is so likely
    to happen, and his difficulties might be so great that starting
    the combination might become urgent. For me there is only the
    cost of the one-way trip, and the prices there which he has
    quoted are in every instance considerably lower than what we
    are bound to spend here.</p>

    <p>I count on having your letter on Saturday morning; <label content="art.support">I have
    bought two more canvases, </label>so that already, on Wednesday
    evening, I have exactly 5 francs left.</p>

    <p>Only here there is still one advantage over the North during
    days of penury, that is the fine weather (for even the mistral
    is fine weather <i>to look at</i>). Perfectly glorious sunshine
    in which Voltaire let himself dry as he drank his coffee. You
    can't help feeling Zola and Voltaire everywhere. It is so
    alive! Like Jan Steen, like Ostade.</p>

    <p>Certainly there would be a chance for a school of painting
    here, but you will tell me that nature is beautiful everywhere
    if you go into it deeply enough.</p>

    <p>Have you read Madame Chrysanth&egrave;me yet, have you
    already made the acquaintance of that so amazingly obliging
    ruffian M. Kangarou? And of the sugared peppers, and the fried
    ices, and the salted sweets?</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I am feeling very, very well these days. In the long run I
    think I shall come to belong to the country altogether.</label></p>

    <p>In a cottage garden I saw a figurehead of a woman carved in
    wood, from the bow of a Spanish ship. It was in a little grove
    of cypresses, and absolutely Monticelli.</p>

    <p>Oh, these farm gardens, with their lovely big red
    Proven&ccedil;al roses, and the vines and the fig trees! It is
    all a poem, and the eternal bright sunshine too, in spite of
    which the foliage remains very green.</p>

    <p>There is a cistern running clear water which irrigates the
    farm along trenches in a complete little system of canals. A
    horse, an old white animal from the Camargue, sets the
    machinery in motion.</p>

    <p>No cows on these little farms.</p>

    <p>My neighbor and his wife (grocers) are amazingly like the
    Buteaux.</p>

    <p>But here farms and low pubs are less dreary and less
    dramatic than in the North, since the warmth, etc., makes
    poverty less harsh and melancholy.</p>

    <p>I do wish you had seen this country. Well, first we must see
    how the Gauguin business will turn out.</p>

    <p>I haven't yet told you that I had a letter from Koning. I
    wrote him a week ago. I can easily see him coming back. Is
    Mourier still there?</p>

    <p>I'd be astonished if that book of Cassagne's were out of
    print. They ought to know it, or know where it could be got, at
    Lalouche's or at the colour shop in the Chauss&eacute;e
    d'Antin. If I ever come to give lessons in drawing, or to have
    to speak to painters on the principles of technique, I must
    have it at hand. It is the <i>only</i> really practical book I
    know, and I know pretty well from experience how useful it is.
    Mourier, McKnight, even Bock, all need it, and how many others
    too. McKnight is always dropping in.</p>

    <p>I have again been working on <art id=0424>a portrait of a Zouave sitting
    on a bench against a white wall</art>, which makes a fifth figure.</p>

    <p>This morning I was at a washing place with figures of women,
    as big as Gauguin's Negresses, one especially in white, black,
    red, and another one all in yellow; there were at least thirty
    of them, old and young.</p>

    <p>I am hoping to send you some more sketches after the painted
    studies.</p>

    <p>I hope to hear from you soon, with a handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
