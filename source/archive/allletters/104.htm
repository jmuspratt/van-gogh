  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your last letter, which made me very happy, many
    thanks. So you have been to Mauve's and had a good time. Did
    you do any drawing while you were there? I was once at
    Weissenbruch's studio, a few days before I first left for
    London, and the memory of what I saw there, the studies and
    pictures, is still as vivid as that of the man himself. When
    you write again, tell me something about the exhibition which
    opened yesterday; how many picture subjects could the artists
    find here on the wharf?</p>

    <p>The reverend Mr. Meyes was here a few days ago with two of
    his sons, and Uncle gave us permission to visit the yard and
    the workshops; the forges, etc., were in full swing. When we
    were there together that Sunday, everything was closed. I also
    visited the training ship, the Wassenaar, with Uncle Pompe and
    Uncle Jan; that was very interesting, too.</p>

    <p>This week the house here was full of people: Uncle and Aunt
    Pompe and Jan, Uncle Cor, Vincent, and Bertha van Gogh from
    Haarlem. This last is a very nice little girl.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday I was at the early-morning service of the
    Reverend Mr. Hasebroek, and later that morning in the Oudezijds
    Chapel which I told you about before. So each day I try my best
    to get on with my work, especially Latin and Greek. I have
    already done a great many exercises, composed of sentences that
    remind me of the old school days, for instance: &ldquo;which
    very excellent philosopher has been condemned to death by the
    Athenians? The very noble and very wise Socrates. Our life
    greatly resembles a journey and is exposed to very many and
    very great dangers. The nature of Odysseus, and the grapes of
    the vineyard.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>This morning I got up very early. It had been raining
    overnight, but very soon the sun broke through the clouds; the
    ground and the piles of wood and beams in the yard were
    drenched, and in the pools the sky's reflection was quite
    golden from the rising sun. At five o'clock I saw those
    hundreds of workmen scatter like little black figures.</p>

    <p>I often visit Uncle Stricker in his study. He is very clever
    and possesses a great many fine books; he loves his work and
    his profession deeply.</p>

    <p>Last Monday Father wrote me a very cheerful letter from
    Helvoirt.<label content="Theo.health"> I also heard from home that you had a 40-guilder bill
    from Dr. Coster; that is a big sum, and paying it will remind
    you of the feeling of having a tooth pulled.</label> If only I could
    help you a little, but you know that I possess neither gold nor
    silver. I often have to resort to all kinds of devices to get
    money for the collections in church - by changing stamps for
    pennies in a tobacco shop, for instance. But, my boy, by
    struggling we can keep on, and you know that it is written that
    the poor will be blessed in the Kingdom of God.</p>

    <p>Whenever I see Uncle Vincent, I am struck anew by something
    indescribably charming and, I should say, something good and
    spiritual in him; I do not know what to call it. Father has it
    even more; Uncle Jan, in another way; and it is also in Uncle
    Cor. Even in a hundred people you would not always find one
    like them, so let us carefully treasure their memory and their
    image. Can it be what F&eacute;nelon described in
    T&eacute;l&eacute;maque?</p>

    <p>He to whom he had chanced to address himself was a stranger
    who had an impressive air, but at the same time a sad,
    depressed quality: now and then he seemed to be thinking of the
    past; he had something very resolute about him, or was deeply
    moved and agitated. At first he hardly listened to Telemachus's
    question, but at last he answered, &ldquo;You are right,
    Ulysses has been received by King Alcinous as in a place where
    they fear God and offer hospitality; but he is no longer there,
    and your search for him would be in vain; he has started for
    Ithaca, if the angry gods will at last allow him to come back
    to his penates.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Telemachus looked at him fixedly; the longer he looked at
    him, the more moved and astonished he was. &ldquo;That
    stranger,&rdquo; said he to Mentor, &ldquo;has answered me like
    a man who hardly listens to what is said to him and who is full
    of bitterness. I pity those who are unhappy because I am, too,
    and my heart is drawn to him without my knowing why. He has
    received me badly enough - he has scarcely deigned to listen to
    me or to answer.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then Mentor said to him, &ldquo;Personally, I am not
    astonished, dear Telemachus, to see you so moved. The cause of
    your sorrow is unknown to you, but not to Mentor. It is nature
    speaking, making herself felt - it is she who softens your
    heart: the stranger who touched you so deeply is the great
    Ulysses. He is going straight to Ithaca; already he is quite
    near the port, and at last he again sees the place so fervently
    longed for.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Your eyes have seen him, but without knowing him;
    soon you will see and know him, and he will know you, but now
    the gods cannot permit your knowing each other outside of
    Ithaca. His heart has been no less moved than yours, but he is
    too wise to reveal himself to any mortal in a place where he is
    exposed to treachery. Ulysses your father is the wisest of all
    men; his heart is like a deep well - one cannot fathom its
    secrets. He loves truth and never abuses it, but he tells it
    only when it is necessary and wise; his lips are sealed to vain
    words at all times. How moved he was when speaking to you! How
    he has had to force himself not to reveal himself, what he has
    suffered in seeing you. That was what made him dejected and
    sad.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And now, boy, a warm handshake in thought. My regards to
    Mauve and others you may meet, especially to the Roos family;
    have a good time, I certainly hope you find a way to pay that
    bill, &agrave; Dieu, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
