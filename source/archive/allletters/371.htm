  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I think I already told you in my last letter that I also
    wanted to start <art id=1140>a large man's figure</art> besides <art id=0068>that woman
    spinning</art>. Enclosed you will now find a sketch of it. Perhaps
    you remember two studies of the same nook, which I already had
    in the studio when you were here.</p>

    <p>I have read Les Maitres d'Autrefois [The Masters of the
    Past] by Fromentin with great pleasure. <label content="art.theory">And that book
    frequently deals with the same questions which have greatly
    preoccupied me of late, and which, in fact, I am continually
    thinking of, especially because when I was last in The Hague I
    heard things Isra&euml;ls had said about starting with a deep
    colour scheme, thus making even relatively dark colours seem
    light. In short, to express light by opposing it to black. I
    already know what you're going to say about &ldquo;too
    black,&rdquo; but at the same time I am not quite convinced yet
    that a grey sky, for instance, <i>must</i> always be painted in
    the local tone. Mauve does it, but Ruysdael does not,
    Dupr&eacute; does not. Corot and Daubigny???</label></p>

    <p>Well, it is the same with figure painting as it is with
    landscape. I mean Isra&euml;ls paints a white wall quite
    differently from Regnault or Fortuny.</p>

    <p>And consequently, the figure stands out quite differently
    against it.</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">When I hear you mention so many new names, it is not always
    easy for me to understand because I have seen absolutely
    <i>nothing</i> of them. And from what you told me about
    &ldquo;impressionism,&rdquo; I have indeed concluded that it is
    different from what I thought, but it's not quite clear to me
    what it really is.</label></p>

    <p>But for my part, I find Isra&euml;ls, for instance, so
    enormously great that I am little curious about or desirous for
    other or newer things.</p>

    <p>Fromentin says of Ruysdael that at present they are <i>much
    further</i> advanced in technique than he was, also much more
    advanced than Cabat, who sometimes greatly resembles Ruysdael
    in his stately simplicity, for instance in the picture at the
    Luxembourg.</p>

    <p>But has what Ruysdael, what Cabat, said become untrue or
    superfluous for that reason? No, it's the same with
    Isra&euml;ls, with De Groux too (De Groux was very simple).</p>

    <p>But if one says what one has to say <i>clearly</i>,
    strictly speaking, isn't that enough? And it may become more
    pleasant to hear if it is said with more charm, something I do
    not disdain, yet it does not add very much to the beauty of
    what is true, because truth has a beauty of its own.</p>

    <p>The measurements of the foregoing sketch are about 105 x 95
    cm., and that of the little woman spinning, 100 X 75. They are
    painted in a tone of bistre and bitumen, which, in my opinion,
    are well suited to expressing the <i>warm</i> chiaroscuro of a
    close, dusty interior. Artz would certainly find it too
    dingy.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">It has already annoyed me <i>for a long time</i>,
    Theo, that some of the present-day painters rob us of the
    bistre and the bitumen, with which surely so many splendid
    things have been painted, and which, well applied, make the
    colouring ripe and mellow and generous, and at the same time
    are so distinguished and possess such very remarkable and
    peculiar qualities.</label></p>

    <p>But at the same time they require some effort in learning to
    use them, for they must be used differently from the ordinary
    colours, and I think it quite possible that many are
    discouraged by the experiments one must make first and which,
    of course, do not succeed on the very first day one begins to
    use them. It is now just about a <i>year ago</i> that I began
    to use them, chiefly for interiors; at first I was awfully
    disappointed in them, but I could not forget the beautiful
    things I had seen made with them.</p>

    <p>You have better opportunities than I to hear about art
    books. If you come across good books, such as that book of
    Fromentin's on the Dutch painters, for instance, or if you
    remember any, don't forget I should be <i>very glad</i> if you
    bought some - provided they treat <i>technical</i> matters -
    and if you deducted the money from my usual allowance. I
    certainly intend to study theory seriously, I do not think it
    at all useless, and I believe that what one feels by instinct
    or by intuition often becomes definite and clear if one is
    guided in one's efforts by some really practical words.</p>

    <p>Even if there might be just <i>one</i> or <i>very few</i>
    things of that kind in a book, it is sometimes worth while not
    only to read it but even to buy it, particularly now.</p>

    <p>And then in the time of Thor&eacute; and Blanc there were
    people who wrote things which, alas, are already being
    forgotten. To give you an example.</p>

    <p>Do you know what &ldquo;un ton entier&rdquo; and &ldquo;un
    ton rompu&rdquo; is? Of course you can <i>see</i> it in a
    picture, but can you also explain what you see? What is meant
    by <i>rompre</i>? Such things one ought to know theoretically
    also, either practically as painter, or in discussing colour as
    a connoisseur.</p>

    <p>Most people give it <i>whatever meaning</i> they like, and
    yet these words, for instance have a very definite
    significance.</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">The laws of the colours are unutterably beautiful, just
    because they are <i>not accidentals</i>. In the same way
    that people nowadays no longer believe in fantastic
    <i>miracles</i>, no longer believe in a God who
    capriciously and despotically flies from one thing to another,
    but begin to feel more respect and admiration for and faith in
    nature - in the same way, and for the same reasons, I think
    that in art, the old-fashioned idea of innate genius,
    inspiration, etc., I do not say must be put aside, but
    thoroughly reconsidered, verified - and greatly modified.
    However, I do not deny the existence of genius, or even its
    being innate. But I certainly do deny the inference that theory
    and instruction should, as a matter of course, always be
    useless.</label></p>

    <p><i>The same thing</i> which I applied in the woman spinning
    and the old man spooling yarn, I hope, or rather I shall try,
    to do much <i>better</i> later on.</p>

    <p>But in these two studies from life I have <i>been a little
    more myself</i> than I succeeded in being in most of the other
    studies - except perhaps in some of my drawings.</p>

    <p>With regard to black - <i>accidentally</i> I did not use it
    in these studies, as I needed, among other things, some
    stronger effects than black; and indigo with terra sienna,
    Prussian blue with burnt sienna, really give much deeper tones
    than pure black itself. When I hear people say &ldquo;there is
    no black in nature,&rdquo; I sometimes think, There is no real
    black in colours either.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">However, you must beware of falling into the error of
    thinking that the colourists do not use black, for of course as
    soon as an element of blue, red, or yellow is mixed with black,
    it becomes a grey, namely, a dark, reddish, yellowish, or
    bluish grey. I found very interesting, for instance, what Ch.
    Blanc says about Vel&aacute;squez' technique in Les Artistes de
    mon temps; his shadows and half-tones consist mostly of
    <i>colourless, cool greys</i>, the chief elements of
    which are black and a little white. In these neutral,
    colourless mediums, the least cloud or shade of red has an
    immediate effect.</label></p>

    <p>Well, goodbye, do write soon if you have anything to tell
    me.</p>

    <p>It sometimes surprises me that you do not feel <i>as
    much</i> for Jules Dupr&eacute; as I should like you to do.</p>

    <p>I am firmly convinced that, if I again saw what I saw of his
    work in the past, far from thinking it less beautiful, I should
    think it <i>even more beautiful</i> than I always instinctively
    did. Dupr&eacute; is <i>perhaps</i> even more of a colourist
    than Corot and Daubigny, though these two are that too, and
    Daubigny especially is very <i>daring</i> in this colour. But
    in Dupr&eacute;'s colour there is something of a splendid
    symphony, <i>complete, studied, manly</i>. I imagine Beethoven
    must be something like that&hellip;</p>

    <p>That symphony is <i>enormously</i> calculated, and yet
    simple, and infinitely deep as nature itself. That is what I
    think of Dupr&eacute;.</p>

    <p>Well, goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p><?showImage("442_V-T_3710");?>
     Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
