    <p>[Extracts from letters written by A. Bonger from Paris to
    his parents.]</p>

    <p>31 March 1885</p>

    <p>I never accompanied a friend to the North Station under more
    melancholy circumstances than a week ago last Friday.</p>

    <p>In the morning my friend Van Gogh had heard that his father
    had had a stroke of apoplexy and was dead. The day before he
    had received a letter from him in which he told him that he was
    in perfect health. Van Gogh is not very strong himself. So you
    can well imagine in what condition he went away.</p>

    <p>4 April 1885</p>

    <p>Yesterday I spent the evening with my friend Van Gogh, who
    was still very sad on account of his father's death. He is the
    most sympathetic person I have had intercourse with in Paris.
    He is a charming fellow to know. It is impossible to imagine
    more entertaining company than his.</p>

    <p>18 July 1885</p>

    <p>If I live I hope to start for Lisle next Saturday; from
    there I shall go to Antwerp via Brugge and Ghent, in order to
    visit Van Gogh's family in Brabant, and from there I shall go
    on to Amsterdam, where I think I shall arrive on Thursday night
    or Friday morning. Reciprocally Van Gogh will probably look me
    up in Amsterdam. It will give me a great deal of pleasure to
    introduce my friend to you. He is a likeable and entertaining
    man&hellip;</p>

    <p>25 August 1885</p>

    <p>&hellip;Since our journey together Van Gogh and I have
    become even more intimate friends than before. He is a person
    who improves more and more on acquaintance, and whose qualities
    of the heart and the head I learn to appreciate ever more. I am
    very glad to hear that he made a good impression on you too. I
    go to him rather often in the evening to read something or to
    work. So far we have devoted our Sunday mornings to the
    Louvre&hellip;</p>

    <p>24 December 1885</p>

    <p>It is certain that Mrs. Van Gogh and her daughter Willy will
    go to Amsterdam in January. Though she may not call on you (she
    broke her leg, and consequently she cannot climb stairs, or
    only with great difficulty), you will certainly hear from her.
    I feel sure that Mien will like the sister. It would give Van
    Gogh and me a great deal of pleasure if you could get on with
    each other. It is a family in which the same tone prevails as
    in yours.</p>
