  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">Since I wrote you yesterday, I could not shake off an
    anxious, restless feeling, and it kept me awake last night.</p>

    <p>It is, Shall I be able to go on or not? - that, in short, is
    why I'm worrying.</label></p>

    <p>You have the photographs now, and you will be able to
    imagine my state of mind better with those in front of you than
    before you saw them. The drawings I make now are only a shadow
    of my intentions - but the shadow which already has a definite
    shape, and which I seek, which I aim at, is not vague, but
    consists of things taken from full reality, which can only be
    mastered by patient and regular work. The idea of working in
    fits and starts is a nightmare to me. Nobody can work without
    money; I think it's right to work with as little as possible,
    but the thought of being left absolutely without what's
    strictly necessary would make anybody depressed and
    melancholy.</p>

    <p>Oh, Theo, the work brings its troubles and cares, but what
    is it in comparison to the misery of a life of inactivity?</p>

    <p>So let's not lose courage, but comfort each other, instead
    of distressing or disheartening each other.</p>

    <p>Now I have spoken to Blommers about my painting - he wants
    me to keep it up; personally I also feel that having finished
    those last ten or twelve large drawings, I have reached a point
    where I must change my course instead of making more in the
    same way.</p>

    <p>What I wrote you about (which you wrote about, too, our
    thoughts having met again), the meagerness or what is called
    dryness, is the first thing to be conquered, lest it become a
    chronic disease. I really think it remarkable that you and I
    seem to have thought the same thing again, for though you wrote
    only a single word about it, it is immediately noticeable in
    the two lithographs and in the photographs, too. Except for
    that defect, they don't seem so bad to me.</p>

    <p>I've been thinking of ways and means to conquer it, but see
    no other help than to renew my energy and also my physical
    strength, for I am afraid it is going the wrong way. I
    absolutely need some money, and must restore both my health and
    my paintbox; otherwise I am afraid things will crop up later
    which would be more difficult to redress. It is now just the
    beginning - and all the same, here and there the last drawings
    are less dry than before.</p>

    <p>If in some way, Theo, I might find some help or sympathy, I
    think it would redress itself soon enough.</p>

    <p>In many lives I could show you similar periods of dryness
    which have become completely overcome. I shan't cite examples,
    for you will find many of your own accord, if you think it
    over. Almost all the fellows who have gone through the
    &Eacute;cole de Rome and who had been drudging assiduously on
    the figure for some time showed at the end of the course rather
    clever, rather correct drawings which are unpleasant to look
    at, however, because there is something of &ldquo;une &acirc;me
    en peine&rdquo; [a soul in pain] in them, which they later lost
    as soon as they could move and breathe a little more freely.
    Now I don't consider myself as clever as those people, but
    without being under the constraint of a definite course, just
    to perfect my drawing, I have forced myself to study the figure
    assiduously, and through that very strain, by constantly
    exerting myself, I have drifted into this dryness.</p>

    <p>I wish you could come soon.</p>

    <p>I repeat, it would be good if my circumstances were a little
    easier, not for my pleasure or comfort, but for the order and
    progress of the work. If you read this letter in relation to
    the photographs I sent you, I hope you will see that I myself
    am perfectly aware of the weak points in the drawings, and that
    I see how to remedy those weak points, and that I certainly do
    not refuse to work hard to conquer them; but at the same time,
    that I am confronted with the difficulty of how to get the
    necessary means for it. It's not your fault that I don't have
    them, but it isn't mine, either, and &ldquo;que faire, que
    faire?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Taking a rest is out of the question, but I think it would
    be a good thing to find distraction in a change of subjects and
    style. After these figure studies, I feel the need of looking
    at the sea, the bronzed potato foliage, the fields of stubble,
    or plowed earth. In order to save time I have not spared
    myself, pinched on everything just to work on, but now I am
    absolutely drained. I can draw no more bills on my personal
    needs, on that side not a drop can be squeezed out, there is
    sickness and dryness.</p>

    <p>I submit for your consideration whether it is
    incomprehensible that I feel pretty hopeless when I think of
    the income getting even smaller, seeing that there is already
    the beginning of want.</p>

    <p>I wish you would come soon.</p>

    <p>I had hoped that some of the ten or twelve drawings might
    have been sold, but this too has come to nothing.</p>

    <p>Well, I hope to keep courage after all, whatever may happen,
    and I hope that perhaps a certain frenzy and rage for work may
    carry me through, like a ship is sometimes thrown over a cliff
    or sandbank by a wave, and can make use of a storm to save
    herself from wrecking. But such maneuvers do not always
    succeed, and it would be desirable to avoid the spot by tacking
    a little. After all, if I fail, what does my loss mean? I don't
    care so much after all. But one generally tries to make one's
    life bear fruit, instead of letting it wither, and at times one
    feels that after all one also has a life of one's own, which is
    not indifferent to the way it is treated.</p>

    <p>But it is beyond my power. If I don't have anything extra
    now and then, as soon as I receive the usual amount, <label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">I have to
    pay out so much that little is left for the ten days ahead, on
    the last of which one walks around with a very weak, faint
    feeling in one's stomach, and then such a path through the
    dunes gets the aspect of a desert.</label></p>

    <p>And one feels oneself sinking, and one cannot get or pay for
    the necessary things. And then the inner struggle - shall I be
    able to go on and continue going along this road? What can I do
    about it?</p>

    <p>At all events write soon whether you have found something in
    the photographs. You don't see anything absurd in them, such as
    one might infer from Tersteeg's remark that he &ldquo;would
    rather have nothing to do with it,&rdquo; do you? After all, I
    am too calm and collected for that.</p>

    <p>Adieu, a firm handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
