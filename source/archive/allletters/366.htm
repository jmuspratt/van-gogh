    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am enclosing a sketch of a picture which is one of those
    I'm working on; this is an afternoon effect of trees in
    blossom. There are<art id=1130> three </art>on the same <art id=1128>subject
    among</art> the drawings<art id=1133> you will get</art> as
    soon as Rappard comes here; what struck me in
    reality was the remarkably quaint, half old-fashioned, half
    rustic character of that garden. And I made three pen-and-ink
    drawings of that same nook, besides several studies which I
    destroyed, just because I wanted to render that character in
    some intimate details, which are not expressed easily or
    without effort or by chance.</p>

    <p>If I, for my part, have some confidence in my own work, it
    is also because it costs me too much effort for me to believe
    that nothing will be gained by it or that it is done in
    vain.</p>

    <p>And I repeat, I shrug my shoulders at the banalities in
    which most connoisseurs seem to indulge more and more.</p>

    <p>Rappard was working on a few pictures which he saw a chance
    of finishing with models he could get, so he wrote to tell me
    that instead of coming at once, he will come in May, and
    perhaps would ask then to be allowed to stay somewhat longer,
    if it were convenient, because he intends to work a little
    here.</p>

    <p>I wish he could come at the same time as you.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">You must by no means suppose that I have great illusions
    about the appreciation of my work; I think one must be
    satisfied if one succeeds in convincing a few people of the
    seriousness of one's intentions, and is understood by them
    without flattery.</label></p>

    <p>For the rest, if there is anything more than that, so much
    the better, but one must think about it as little as possible.
    But yet I believe the work must be seen, because the few
    friends will sift down from that very stream of passers-by. But
    one need not mind what people in general say and do.
    Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
