    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>In the first box going to The Hague you will find a few
    parcels; will you be so kind as to send them on?</p>

    <p>First, there is one for yourself, which contains Felix Holt.
    When you have read it, please send it to Etten; and when they
    have finished it, please have them return it here, for it does
    not belong to me. It is a book that impressed me very much, and
    I am sure it will be the same with you. There is also a parcel
    for Mr. Tersteeg and one for his wife, and also one for Mauve
    and his wife. I wrote Mauve that someday he must ask you for
    that book on Michel; please show it to him when you have a
    chance. There is also a parcel for Father. Try to send it to
    Etten in time for his birthday; perhaps you might add Felix
    Holt, and you can read it after it has been to Etten - maybe
    that will be the best. In the little roll addressed to you are
    three etchings after Jules Dupr&eacute; - one for Uncle Jan van
    Gogh with my kindest regards and one for Father. There is also
    a lithograph after Bodmer and an etching by Jacque for Father.
    Another lithograph, after Cabat, is for you.</p>

    <p>Cabat resembles Ruysdael. There are two beautiful pictures
    of his at the Luxembourg: one, a pond with trees around it in
    autumn at sunset; the other, a road along a waterside and a few
    large oak trees on a grey autumn evening. The etching after
    Jules Dupr&eacute; is beautiful. It is from an album of six
    which includes Dupr&eacute;'s portrait. He has such a simple
    and noble face, it reminds me somehow of Mauve; but he is
    older, and perhaps in reality they do not look at all
    alike.</p>

    <p>You are right to take English lessons; you will not be
    sorry. I should like to send you a Longfellow and Andersen's
    Fairy Tales; I shall try to get them. If I send them, read
    especially Longfellow's Evangeline, Miles Standish, King Robert
    of Sicily, etc.</p>

    <p>And now it is again time to say good-by, with a firm
    handshake. Regards to Roos, and to anybody who asks about me,
    and believe me always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Also give my compliments to friend Borchers.</p>
