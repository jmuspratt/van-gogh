  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Work engrosses me so much that I cannot manage to write
    letters. I should have liked to write Gauguin again, because
    I'm afraid that he is worse than he said; his last letter in
    pencil looked very much as though he were.</p>

    <p>If it's true, what's to be done? I have had no reply from
    Russell yet. Yesterday at sunset I was on a stony heath where
    some very small and twisted oaks grow; in the background, a
    ruin on the hill, and wheat in the valley. It was romantic, you
    can't escape it, like Monticelli; the sun was pouring bright
    yellow rays on the bushes and the ground, a perfect shower of
    gold. And all the lines were lovely, the whole thing nobly
    beautiful. You would not have been a bit surprised to see
    knights and ladies suddenly appear, coming back from hunting or
    hawking, or to have heard the voice of some old
    Proven&ccedil;al troubadour. The fields looked violet, the
    distances blue. I brought back <art id=0466>a study</art>, but it is very far
    below what I tried to do.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Tasset did not send enough zinc white the other day. I get
    on very well using it, but it has the disadvantage of drying
    very slowly, so that the studies made at Stes.-Maries, for
    instance, are not yet dry.</label> I was planning to go into the
    Camargue, but the veterinary surgeon who was to have taken me
    with him on his rounds has left me in the lurch. I don't much
    care, as I have only a moderate affection for wild bulls.</p>

    <p>To my amazement I can already see the bottom of my purse,
    though it is true that I have had to pay my month's rent.</p>

    <p>You must realize that when I take the money for food and
    lodging out of it, all the rest goes into canvases. Altogether
    these are pretty expensive, not counting the trouble they
    give.</p>

    <p>I dare hope that someday we'll get back part of the money we
    spend, and if I had more money, I should spend even more to try
    to get a very rich colouring.</p>

    <p><?showImage("616_V-T_5080");?>
    </p>

    <p>Here is a new subject. <art id=0428>A corner of a garden</art> with clipped
    shrubs and a weeping tree, and in the background some clumps of
    oleanders. And the lawn just cut with long trails of hay drying
    in the sun, and a little corner of blue sky at the top.</p>

    <p>I am in the middle of reading Balzac, C&eacute;sar
    Birotteau. I will send it to you when I have finished it - I
    think I shall read the whole of Balzac again.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.loneliness">When I came here I hoped it would be possible to make some
    connection with art lovers here, but up to the present I
    haven't made the least progress in people's affection. And
    Marseilles? I don't know, but that may very well be nothing but
    an illusion. In any case I have quite given up gambling much on
    it. Often whole days pass without my speaking to anyone, except
    to ask for dinner or coffee. And it has been like that from the
    beginning.</label></p>

    <p>But up to now the loneliness has not worried me much because
    I have found the brighter sun and its effect on nature so
    absorbing.</p>

    <p>Write me a day or two early if you can, the end of the week
    will be rather tough.</p>

    <p>With a handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
