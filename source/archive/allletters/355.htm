  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I was glad to get your letter of today, and the enclosure,
    and thank you very much for both.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that up to now Mother's recovery is very
    satisfactory in general. And that there is less and less
    <i>immediate</i> danger, and that it is more and more reduced
    to a question of time.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless - Mother will certainly not be quite the same
    after the fracture is healed. I believe that the effect on her,
    and the unavoidable countereffect on Father, will be that it
    will prove to have pushed them a long way into old age.</p>

    <p>Under the circumstances I was glad to be at home, and as the
    present accident has pushed some questions (in which I differ
    from Father and Mother) entirely into the background, we get on
    pretty well; and the result may be that I shall stay more and
    longer at Nuenen than I thought possible at first. As a matter
    of course I shall be able to lend a helping hand, especially
    later on when Mother will have to be moved more often, etc.</p>

    <p>Since the panic of the first days has calmed down a little,
    I can do my work pretty regularly.</p>

    <p>Every day I am busy <i>painting</i> studies of the weavers
    here, which I think are technically better than the painted
    studies done in Drenthe, which I sent you.</p>

    <p>Those subjects of the looms, with their rather complicated
    machinery with a little figure sitting in the middle, will also
    lend themselves to pen drawings, I think, and I will make some,
    according to the hint you gave me in your letter.</p>

    <p><i>Before</i> the accident happened, I had settled with
    Father that I should have free board and lodging here for some
    time, so that I might use your money to pay off some bills at
    the beginning of the year. And the money you sent on New Year's
    Day and about the middle of January was lying ready for that.
    But as I gave it to Father when the accident happened, this
    time it will be those colour bill's turn. The more so because
    Father has had a windfall, as Uncle Stricker sent him 100
    guilders, which I think very kind of Uncle S.</p>

    <p>So, as far as the money goes, I have not profited from being
    here.</p>

    <p>And I am firmly resolved to carry on the work
    vigorously.</p>

    <p><i>After about a year</i> Father will feel more keenly the
    financial difficulties which Mother's accident cannot fail to
    bring in its train. Therefore, in the meantime let's try to do
    something with my work. After all, <i>Father and Mother
    personally</i> will be secure for life, Father's pension being
    equal to his present salary. <label content="attitude.sisters">But, brother, <i>the poor
    sisters</i> - without capital at a time in our society when the
    inclination to marry a penniless girl is not great - for them
    life might remain dark and dreary - and their normal
    development frustrated.</label></p>

    <p>But let's not anticipate things.</p>

    <p>It is difficult to say in advance how the constant lying
    still in bed will influence Mother's health.</p>

    <p>All precautions we can take to prevent bedsores are, of
    course, of the greatest importance. We have made a kind of
    stretcher to move Mother if necessary, but at present the less
    it happens the better. The most important thing is for her to
    lie quietly.</p>

    <p><?showImage("418_V-T_3550");?>
     Taking her difficult situation into consideration, I am glad
    to say Mother's spirits are very even and bright. And she is
    amused by trifles. The other day I painted for her <art id=1117>a little
    church with the hedge and the trees (like this)</art>.</p>

    <p>You will easily understand that I love the scenery here.
    When you come, I shall take you into the cottages of the
    weavers. The figures of the weavers, and the women who wind the
    yarn, will certainly strike you.</p>

    <p>The last study I made is the <art id=0026>figure of a man sitting at the
    loom, the figure apart, the bust and hands</art>.</p>

    <p><art id=1119>I am painting a loom of old, greenish, browned oak, in which
    the date 1730 is cut. Near that loom, in front of a little
    window which looks out on a green plot, there is a baby chair,
    and a baby sits in it, looking for hours at the shuttle flying
    to and fro</art>.</p>

    <p>I have painted that thing exactly as it was in reality, <art id=1118>the
    loom with the little weaver, the little window and the baby
    chair in the miserable little room with the loam floor</art>.</p>

    <p>Please write me some more details about the Manet
    exhibition; tell me which of his pictures are there. I have
    always found Manet's work very original. Do you know that
    article of Zola's on Manet? I am sorry to have seen so very few
    of his pictures. I should especially like to see his figures of
    nude women. I do not think it exaggerated that some people, for
    instance Zola, <i>rave</i> about him, though I, for my part, do
    not think he can be reckoned among the very first of this
    century. But his is a talent which <i>certainly</i> has its
    <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, and that is a great thing in
    itself. The article which Zola wrote about him is published in
    the volume Mes Haines. For my part, I cannot agree with Zola's
    <i>conclusions</i>, as if Manet were a man who opens a new
    future to modern ideas of art; I consider <i>Millet</i>, not
    Manet, to be that essentially modern painter who opened a new
    horizon to many. Goodbye. With a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Love from all. <i>Write to Mother a little more often</i>,
    letters are such a distraction.</p>
