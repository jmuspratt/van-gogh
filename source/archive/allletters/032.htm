    <p>[Letterhead] Paris, July 24 1875</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">A few days ago we received a picture by de Nittis,
    a view of London on a rainy day, Westminster bridge and the house of
    Parliament [sic]. I used to pass over Westminsterbridge every morning
    and evening and know how it looks when the sun sets behind
    Westminster abbey and the house of Parliament, and how it looks
    early in the morning, and in winter in snow and fog.</p>

    <p>When I saw the picture I felt how much I loved London. Still
    I think that it is better for me that I left it.</label></p>

    <p>This in answer to your question.</p>

    <p>I certainly do not believe that you will be sent to
    London.</p>

    <p>Thanks for the &ldquo;Springtime of Life.&rdquo; And
    &ldquo;At Midnight&rdquo; by R&uuml;ckert. The first is very
    beautiful, the latter reminds me of &ldquo;September
    Night&rdquo; by de Musset. I wish I could send it you, but I do
    not possess it.</p>

    <p>Yesterday we sent a box to The Hague in which you will find
    what I promised you.</p>

    <p>I hear that Anna and Liesbeth are at home, I should like to
    see them.</p>

    <p>Be as happy as you can and write to me soon. With a firm
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
