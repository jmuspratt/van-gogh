    <p>[Letter from Theo, on the other half of which is Vincent's
    reply]</p>

    <p>The Hague, 7 September 1875</p>

    <p>Dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Last spring Weehuizen died. I thought you knew. He died very
    suddenly after a few days' illness. He died in hospital with
    nobody present. I greatly regretted that I was not with him. I
    had been on familiar terms with him of late. He had read
    Michelet's L'Amour and often talked about it to me, and he
    loved nature so much and sought the <i>still sadness</i> in it.
    Last Sunday I heard a beautiful sermon. Jesus wept.</p>

    <p>Thank you for the lithographs and the book by Michel you
    promised me; I am very curious to see them.</p>

    <p>I have taken your letter to the Borchers. They seem to be
    good people, and I hope to see more of them. Today we received
    the novelties, including that engraving after Rembrandt. It
    looks fine, the figure of Jesus especially is beautiful, and
    the whole is noble. Adieu, good luck.</p>

    <p>Yours affectionately, Theo</p>

    <p>The frames for the engravings for Mother's birthday cost 4
    guilders apiece.</p>

    <p>[Reply]</p>

    <p>Paris, 8 September 1875</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You didn't expect to get this letter back, did you?</p>

    <p>No, my lad, that's not the way to look at it. Certainly
    Weehuizen's death is sad, but sad in another way than you
    say.</p>

    <p>Keep your eyes open, and try to be strong and brave. Are you
    sure that Michelet's book was the right one for him?</p>

    <p>Theo, I want to make a suggestion that may perhaps surprise
    you. Do not read Michelet any longer or <i>any</i> other book
    but the Bible till we meet again at Christmas, and do as I told
    you: go out in the evening often, dropping in on Van Stockum,
    Borchers and the like. I don't think you will regret it; you
    will feel much freer once you start this regimen.</p>

    <p>Beware of the words I underlined in your letter. There is
    still a sadness, certainly, thank God, but I do not know
    whether we are entitled to it yet. You notice I say <i>we</i>:
    I, no more than you.</p>

    <p>The other day Pa wrote me, &ldquo;Sadness does no harm, but
    makes us see things with a holier eye.&rdquo; <i>This</i> is
    the true &ldquo;still sadness,&rdquo; the pure gold, but we
    have not got as far as that, not by a long shot. Let us hope
    and pray we may get there, and believe me always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>I have got a little bit further than you, and I see already
    that, alas, the maxim &ldquo;La jeunesse et l'adolescence ne
    sont que vanit&eacute;&rdquo; [Youth and adolescence are
    nothing but vanity] is <i>nearly</i> all true. So keep heart,
    old fellow, I shake your hand warmly.</p>
