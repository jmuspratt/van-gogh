  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your registered letter of November 20 in good
    order and thank you very much for sending it; from my letter,
    which must have crossed yours, you will already have gathered
    how welcome it was.</p>

    <p>But you wrote that you sent Buhot's paper at the same time
    as your letter; however, it did not come then, and up till
    today, Friday, I have not received it. Have they made a mistake
    at the post office again, or did you perhaps forget to send
    it?</p>

    <p>I waited until today to answer your letter in order to see
    whether the postman had delayed delivering it.</p>

    <p>I hope you have also received the roll containing the
    <art id=1656>&ldquo;Digger.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>Today and yesterday I drew <art id=997>two figures</art> of an <art id=998>old man sitting
    with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands</art>.
    Long ago Schuitemaker sat for me, and
    I kept <art id=863>the drawing </art>[see Letter 150] because I wanted to make a
    better one someday. Perhaps I will also make <art id=1662>a lithograph of
    it. </art>How beautiful such an old workman is, with his patched
    fustian clothes and his bald head.</p>

    <p>I finished Zola's Pot-Bouille, the strongest passage I think
    is the confinement of Ad&egrave;le, the cook (Bretonne
    <i>pouilleuse</i>), in the dark attic. Josserand is also drawn
    confoundedly well and with sentiment, like the rest of the
    figures; but those two sombre ones, Josserand writing his
    addresses in the nighttime and that servant's attic, impressed
    me most.</p>

    <p>How well constructed the book is, and how bitter the words
    it closes with: &ldquo;Aujourd'hui toutes les maisons se
    valent, l'une ou l'autre c'est le m&ecirc;me chose, c'est
    partout Cochon et Cie.&rdquo; [Nowadays all firms are worth the
    same, the one is equal to the other, everywhere it is Swine and
    Co.] Don't you think Octave Mouret, really the principal
    figure, can be considered typical of those persons whom you
    recently wrote about, if you remember? In many respects he is
    much better than most of them; however, he will satisfy neither
    you nor me, and I feel a shallowness in him. Could he have done
    otherwise? - perhaps not, but you and I can and must act
    differently, I think. For we have our roots in a different kind
    of family life than Mouret, and besides, I hope there will
    always remain in us something of the Brabant fields and heath,
    which years of city life will not be able to wipe out,
    especially as it is renewed and strengthened by art.</p>

    <p>He - Octave Mouret - is satisfied when he can readily sell
    his bales of &ldquo;nouveaut&eacute;s&rdquo; (d&eacute;baller
    des ballots de marchandises sur les trottoirs de Paris)
    [unloading his bales of goods on the sidewalks of Paris]; he
    doesn't seem to have any other aspiration except the conquest
    of women, and yet he does not really love them, for Zola
    perceives correctly, I think, when he says, &ldquo;o&ugrave;
    percait son m&eacute;pris pour la femme&rdquo; [where his
    contempt for women broke through].</p>

    <p>Well, I do not know what to think of him. He seems to be a
    product of his time - in reality more passive than active,
    notwithstanding his activity.</p>

    <p>But after Zola's book, I at last read Quatre-Vingt-Treize
    [`93] by Victor Hugo. Here we are in quite a different field.
    It is painted - I mean written - like Decamps or Jules
    Dupr&eacute;, with expressions like the ones in the old
    pictures by Ary Scheffer, for instance &ldquo;Le
    Larmoyeur&rdquo; [The Mute] and &ldquo;Le Coupeur de
    Nappe&rdquo; [The Man Who Cut the Tablecloth]<sup>1</sup> - or
    the figures in the background of the &ldquo;Christus
    Consolator.&rdquo; I would strongly advise you to read it if
    you haven't already, for the sentiment in which this book is
    written becomes more and more rare, and among the new things, I
    really have not found anything nobler.</p>

    <p>It is easier to say, as Mesdag did of a certain picture by
    Heyerdahl, painted with the same sentiment as that of Murillo
    or Rembrandt, which he didn't want to buy from you, &ldquo;Oh,
    that's the old style - we don't need that any more,&rdquo; than
    it is to replace that old style by something as good, let alone
    something superior.</p>

    <p>And as many people these days argue the same way as Mesdag,
    without thinking much about it, it can do no harm if others
    reflect whether we are in this world to tear down instead of
    build up. The expression &ldquo;We don't need that any
    more&rdquo; - how readily it is used, and what a stupid and
    ugly phrase it is. In one of his fairy tales Andersen puts it,
    I think, not in a human being's mouth, but in an old pig's.
    People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.</p>

    <p>This week I saw with great pleasure a picture by De Bock in
    Goupil's show window; it seemed to me much, much better than
    the one he was working on this spring. It represents a cottage
    in the dunes with an avenue of trees in front, the background
    sombre and full of tone, with a beautiful light sky over it.
    There was something grand and cheerful in it.</p>

    <p>I said just now that he who lives in a glass house shouldn't
    throw stones. I'm afraid, Theo, that many who have sacrificed
    the old for the sake of the new will be very sorry for it in
    the end. Especially in the realm of art.</p>

    <p>In short, there used to be a body of painters, authors,
    artists, who were united, notwithstanding their differences,
    and they were a force. They did not walk in the dark but were
    enlightened: they certainly knew what they wanted, and they did
    not waver. I'm talking about the time when Corot, Millet,
    Daubigny, Jacque, Breton, were young; in Holland, Isra&euml;ls,
    Mauve, Maris, etc.</p>

    <p>One supported the other, there was something strong and
    noble in it. The art galleries were smaller then; in the
    studios there was perhaps a greater abundance than now - as the
    beautiful things are soon snapped up. Those crammed studios,
    those smaller show windows, but above all, la foi de
    charbonnier of the artists - their warmth, their fire, their
    enthusiasm - how sublime they were. Neither you nor I witnessed
    it exactly, but our love for that period brings us nearer to
    it. Let's not forget it, it may be of use, especially if one
    continues to say so readily, &ldquo;We don't need that any
    more.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
