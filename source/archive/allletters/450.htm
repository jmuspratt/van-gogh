  <body>
    <p>Antwerp, 1<sup>st</sup> half February 1886</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your letter and enclosed 25 fr., and thank you
    very much for both. I am very glad that you are not opposed to
    my intention of coming to Paris. I think it will help me to
    make progress, and if I did not go, I am afraid I should get
    into a mess, and continue to go in the same circle and keep on
    making the same mistakes. Besides, I do not think it would do
    you any harm to come home to a studio in the evening.</p>

    <p>For the rest, I must say exactly the same about myself as
    you write about yourself: <i>You will be disappointed in
    me</i>.</p>

    <p>Yet the thing to do is to combine. And the result may be a
    much better understanding.</p>

    <p><label subject="health.dental">Now what shall I tell you about my health? I keep thinking
    there is a chance of avoiding a real illness, but it will take
    some time to restore my health.</p>

    <p>I have two more teeth that must be filled, then my upper
    jaw, which was in the worst condition, will be all right. I
    have still to pay 10 fr. on it, and then another 40 fr. to have
    the lower jaw taken care of too.</p>

    <p>Thus some of those ten years which I seem to have spent in
    prison will disappear. Because bad teeth, which one rarely
    sees nowadays when it is so easy to have them taken care of,
    give the face a somewhat sunken look.</p>

    <p>And then, even when taking the same food, one can digest it
    better when one can chew well, so my stomach will have a better
    chance to recover.</p>

    <p>But I can feel that I am in a bad condition, and as you
    write yourself, by neglecting it, it might become much worse.
    But we will try to get over it.</label></p>

    <p>I have not worked for a few days. I went to bed early a few
    times (generally after drawing at the club it was one or two
    o'clock) and I feel that it does me good.</p>

    <p>I had a little note from Mother saying that they will start
    packing in March.</p>

    <p>Further, as you tell me that your lease is not up till the
    end of June, perhaps it might be better after all if I went
    back to Nuenen in the beginning of March; but if I should have
    to meet with opposition and scenes like the ones before I left,
    I should lose time there, and then I should go somewhere else,
    if only for a few months, as I want to make some new things
    out-of-doors to take to Paris with me.</p>

    <p>That Sibert, the drawing-class teacher who at first spoke to
    me in the way I wrote you about, definitely picked a fight with
    me today, perhaps to get rid of me, but he did not succeed
    because I told him, &ldquo;Pourquoi cherchez-vous dispute avec
    moi, je ne veux pas me disputer, et en tout cas je n'y tiens
    aucunement &agrave; vous contredire, seulement vous me cherchez
    dispute expr&egrave;s.&rdquo; [Why do you pick a quarrel with
    me, I don't want to quarrel, and in any case I don't desire the
    least bit to contradict you, only you pick a quarrel with me on
    purpose.]</p>

    <p>Apparently he did not expect this, and just this once could
    not say much in answer, but next time he can of course start a
    fight all right.</p>

    <p>What's behind it is that the fellows in the class are
    discussing my work, and that I have said - not to Sibert, but
    outside the class to some of the fellows - that their drawings
    were absolutely wrong.</p>

    <p>I can tell you, if I went to Cormon, and if sooner or later
    I got into trouble either with the teacher or with the pupils,
    <i>I should not mind it a bit</i>. Even without a teacher I
    might go through that course of drawing from the ancients, by
    going and drawing at the Louvre, for instance. And if necessary
    I should do so, though I should by far prefer to have my work
    corrected, as long as it does not become <i>deliberate
    nagging</i> - that correction without any other motive than a
    certain peculiar-ity in one's way of working which is different
    from that of the others.</p>

    <p>If he begins again I shall say aloud in the class, &ldquo;Je
    veux bien faire m&eacute;caniquement tout ce que vous me direz
    de faire, parce que j'y tiens &agrave; vous rendre ce qui vous
    revient &agrave; la rigueur, si vous y tenez, mais pour ce qui
    est de me m&eacute;caniser comme vous mecanisez les autres,
    cela n'a, je vous assure, pas la moindre prise sur moi.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Vous avez du reste commenc&eacute; &agrave; me dire
    tout autre chose, c'est a dire que vous m'avez dit: prenez
    vous-y, comme vous voudrez.&rdquo; [I am quite willing to do
    all that you tell me to do mechanically, because, if necessary,
    I particularly want to give you your due, if you desire it, but
    as for mechanizing me as you mechanize the others, I assure
    you it will not influence me in the least.</p>

    <p>Anyway, you started by telling me something quite different,
    that is, you said: Go to work just as you like.]</p>

    <p>The reason I draw from the plaster casts, <i>ne pas prendre
    par le contour mais prendre par le milieux</i> - I have not
    mastered it yet, but I feel it more and more, and I shall
    certainly carry it through, it is too interesting. I wish we
    could be together in the Louvre for a few days and talk it
    over. I think it would interest you.</p>

    <p>This morning I am sending you Ch&eacute;rie, especially
    because of the preface, which will certainly strike you.</p>

    <p>And I wish that we too might work together somewhere at the
    end of our lives, and looking back, might say - &ldquo;Firstly,
    we have done <i>this</i>, and secondly <i>that</i>, and thirdly
    <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And if we have the wish and the courage, will there be
    something to talk over then? We can try two things - make some
    good things ourselves - and collect and do business with what
    things of others we admire. But we must <i>both live</i>
    somewhat more vigorously, and perhaps joining hands is a step
    toward this.</p>

    <p>But now, allow me to touch on a delicate question. If I have
    said some unpleasant things about our upbringing and our home,
    this has been because of finding each other and understanding
    each other in business; and when working together, we are on a
    ground where there <i>must be</i> criticism.</p>

    <p>Now I can perfectly understand that one can love a thing or
    a person passionately, and cannot help it.</p>

    <p>All right, I will not butt in, only in so far as it might
    make a fatal separation between us where unity is necessary.
    And our education, etc., will not prove to have been so good
    that we will keep many illusions about it, and perhaps we would
    have been happier with another education.</p>

    <p>But if we keep to the positive fact of wanting to produce
    and to be something, then we can talk over accomplished facts,
    when it cannot be avoided, without getting angry, even if they
    might concern, or stand in direct relation with, the Goupils or
    our family. Besides, these questions are between you and me for
    a better understanding of the situation, and not out of
    spite.</p>

    <p>But if we undertake something, it will be no unimportant
    thing for either of us to improve our health, because we shall
    need a long life, at least twenty-five or thirty years of
    incessant work. The present time is so interesting if one
    considers that it is possible we shall witness the beginning of
    the end of a society.</p>

    <p>And in the same way as there is infinite poetry in autumn,
    or in a sunset, when one feels a mysterious aspiration in
    nature, so it is now. And in art there is decadence if you
    like, after Delacroix, Corot, Millet, Dupr&eacute;, Troyon,
    Breton, Rousseau and Daubigny, que soit, but a decadence so
    full of charm that you can still expect enormously beautiful
    things, and they are made every day.</p>

    <p>I am longing terribly for the Louvre, the Luxembourg, etc.,
    where everything will be new to me.</p>

    <p>All my life I shall regret not having seen the <i>Cent
    chefs-d'oevre</i>, the Delacroix exhibition and the Meissonier
    exhibition. But there are other things left.</p>

    <p>It is true that I may have made less progress through
    wanting to get on here too quickly, but what shall I say? One
    of the reasons was my health, and if I get that back as I hope,
    my work here will prove to have been less unfruitful.</p>

    <p>Am I right that if one asks permission, one may draw from
    the plaster casts in the Louvre even if one is not at the Ecole
    des Beaux-Arts? It would not surprise me if, once having got
    used to the idea of living together, you will think it stranger
    and stranger that for fully ten years we have been so little
    together.</p>

    <p>Well, I certainly hope that this will be the end of it, and
    that it will not begin again.</p>

    <p>The apartment which you mention is perhaps rather expensive;
    I mean, I should like a somewhat cheaper one just as well.</p>

    <p>I wonder how those few months in Nuenen will be.</p>

    <p>As I still have some furniture there, and as the country
    there is very beautiful, and as I know the neighborhood pretty
    well, it would perhaps be a good thing to keep a pied-a-terre
    there in some inn, where I could leave the furniture, as
    otherwise it would be lost, and under the circumstances it may
    be of so much use.</p>

    <p>The best things are sometimes made when one comes back to
    old spots.</p>

    <p>I must finish this as I must go to the club. Think over what
    would be the best thing to do.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
