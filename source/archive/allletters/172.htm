  <body>
    <p>Sunday evening Schenkweg 138 (near Ryn station)</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is true I wrote you only yesterday, but I thought I would
    write you again. For though I still have a dose of courage
    left, it is sometimes very hard always to show a good face to
    Mauve and Tersteeg and others. Yet I must, for though I do not
    pretend to be carefree, I need not tell them all the details
    and particulars. But it happens often enough that I am quite at
    a loss as to what to do. <label content="psychology.neurological">Now this morning I felt so miserable
    that I went to bed; I had a headache and was feverish from
    worry because I dread this week so much, and do not know how to
    get through it. And then I got up, but went back to bed again;
    now I feel a little better, </label>but I wanted you to know that I did
    not exaggerate in yesterday's letter. If only I continue
    working hard, it will not be long before I earn something with
    my work; but meanwhile I am greatly harassed by scarcity of
    funds. <label content="art.equipment">Besides, I still have relatively few drawing materials,
    or else defective ones. For the present it is sufficient - I
    have my paintbox and easel and brushes; but, for instance, this
    week my drawing board warped like a barrel because it was too
    thin, and my easel also got damaged in delivery, which is bad
    enough.</label></p>

    <p>Well, there are a lot of things which I still want to or
    have to improve; of course it needn't all be done at once, but
    daily it causes small expenses which, added together, worry me
    a great deal. Sometimes my clothes need repairing, and Mauve
    has already given me a few hints about that too, which I shall
    certainly carry out; but it cannot all be done at once. <label content="lifestyle.clothing">You
    know my clothes are chiefly old things of yours which have been
    altered for me, or a few have been bought ready-made and are of
    poor material. So they look shabby, and especially all my
    dabbling in paint makes keeping them decent even more
    difficult; it is the same with boots. My underwear is also
    beginning to fall apart. You know that I have been without
    means for a long time already, and then many things get
    dilapidated.</label></p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">And sometimes one involuntarily becomes terribly depressed,
    if only for a moment, often just when one is feeling cheerful,
    as I really am even now. That's what happened this morning;
    these are evil hours when one feels quite helpless and faint
    with overexertion.</label> I think it was really because I had arranged
    with Mauve about what I would do with a model out-of-doors, and
    then all at once I thought, Perhaps I cannot do it because in
    two days I shall not have a cent left, and than Mauve will
    think I was afraid. So I got up again to write you once more
    because I felt so anxious. Having to think about too many other
    things against my will hampers me so much in my work; even when
    I am in front of my model, I do not know how I shall pay him or
    whether I shall be able to go on the next day or not. And I
    must, I must be calm and quiet in order to work - it is
    difficult enough anyhow. And especially now I must keep up my
    spirits; but I felt so clearly this morning that my strength
    was failing me, not my ardour or my courage, and therefore I'm
    telling you once more.</p>

    <p>I can quite imagine that you also have your difficulties,
    but I think some arrangement might be made with Tersteeg which
    would settle everything.</p>

    <p>Now that I can work at Pulchri with a model two evenings a
    week, perhaps four days with the model would be enough if
    necessary; and now I have found that old woman, it needn't be
    so expensive as it was at first when I had a new one every day.
    For I have already had several models, but they are either too
    expensive or they think it's too far to come here, or they make
    objections afterward and do not come back. But I think I have
    hit on the right one in this old woman.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I had a lesson from Mauve on drawing hands and
    faces so as to keep the colour transparent. Mauve knows things
    so thoroughly, and when he tells you something, he exerts
    himself and doesn't just say it to hear himself talk; and I
    exert myself to listen carefully and to put it into practice.
    Yesterday I told Mauve again that it was so necessary for me to
    earn something, but I will not ask him for money, as he gives
    me something that is much better than money; and besides, he
    has already helped me with my furniture, and that is more than
    enough.</p>

    <p>Now that I have written you, I will set to work again
    tomorrow full of confidence. When you were in Etten last
    summer, you spoke about my working in watercolours. At that
    point I didn't even know how to start it. Now the light is
    beginning to dawn, and in spite of everything, the sun is
    rising.</p>

    <p>Well, adieu, Theo, receive a handshake in thought and
    believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
