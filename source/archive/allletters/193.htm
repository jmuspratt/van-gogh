  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>If I am to succeed in giving you further insight into what
    I've already written you about, you must understand the root of
    it. And I must not put my visit to Amsterdam in a better light
    than it really was. But I begin by begging you not to think me
    impertinent when I contradict you. And before all this, I must
    thank you most kindly for the enclosed 50 fr.</p>

    <p>It will be no use if I don't put it strongly. I would remain
    silent if you wanted me to give in to you, but I don't think
    you do, and perhaps you yourself will not think it unnatural
    that some things in life are less developed in you than your
    business sense, which I fully consider twice as good as mine,
    and I shall not readily risk telling you this or that is not
    so. On the contrary, especially when you explain things to me,
    I often feel you know better than I. But on the other hand,
    when it comes to love, I am often astonished at the way you
    think.</p>

    <p>For your last letter has given me more food for thought than
    perhaps you realize. I think my mistake and the real reason for
    my being refused is this: when one is without money, of course
    one is of no account, so it was a mistake and shortsightedness
    on my part to take what Mauve said literally, or to suppose for
    a moment that Tersteeg would remember that I have had so much
    trouble already.</p>

    <p>At present money is what the right of the strongest used to
    be. To contradict a person is fatal, and if one does, the
    reaction is not that the other party is made to reflect, but
    that one gets a blow with the fist. That is to say, in the form
    of, &ldquo;I will not buy from him again,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I
    will not help him again.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.apprehension">This being so, I risk my head when I contradict you, but,
    Theo, I don't know how I could do otherwise; if my head must be
    cut off, here is my neck. You know the circumstances and know
    that my life or death depends on your help. But I am between
    two fires. If I reply to your letter: Yes, Theo, you are right,
    I will give up Christine, then first I tell a lie in agreeing
    with you and second, I commit myself to doing a vile thing. If
    I contradict you and you act like T. and M., it will cost me my
    head, so to speak.</p>

    <p>Well, for heaven's sake, off with my head, if that's the way
    it has to be. The other thing is even worse.</label></p>

    <p>So here is a short memorandum, clearly explaining a few
    things which I think may possibly cause you to withdraw your
    help. But to conceal them so as not to lose your help seems to
    me an underhanded thing to do, and I would rather risk the
    worst. If I succeed in making you understand what I think you
    don't yet understand, then Christine, her child and myself will
    be safe. And in order to accomplish this, I must risk saying
    what I am going to say.</p>

    <p>To express my feelings for Kee, I said resolutely,
    &ldquo;She, and no other.&rdquo; And her &ldquo;no, never
    never&rdquo; was not strong enough to make me give her up. I
    still had hope, and my love remained, notwithstanding this
    refusal, which I thought was like a piece of ice that would
    melt. But I could find no rest. The strain became unbearable
    because she was always silent and I never received a word in
    answer.</p>

    <p>Then I went to Amsterdam. There they told me, &ldquo;When
    you are in the house, Kee leaves it. She answers, `Certainly
    not him,' to your `she, and no other'; your persistence is
    <i>disgusting</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I put my hand in the flame of the lamp and said, &ldquo;Let
    me see her for as long as I can keep my hand in the
    flame&rdquo; - no wonder that later H. G. T. may have looked at
    my hand.</p>

    <p>But they blew out the lamp, I believe, and said,
    &ldquo;<i>You shall not see her</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And thereafter I also had a discussion with her brother who
    said - officially or unofficially - that only money would be
    able to achieve something here. Officially or unofficially - I
    find it mean in both cases, and when I left Amsterdam, I had a
    feeling as if I had been on a slave market.</p>

    <p>Well, it was too much for me, especially when they spoke of
    my wanting to coerce her, and I felt that the crushing things
    they said to me were unanswerable, and that my &ldquo;she, and
    no other&rdquo; had been killed.</p>

    <p>Then, not at once, but very soon, I felt that love die
    within me; a void, an infinite void came in its stead. You know
    I believe in God, I did not doubt the power of love, but then I
    felt something like, &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast Thou
    forsaken me,&rdquo; and everything became a blank. I thought,
    Have I been deceiving myself?&hellip;&rdquo;O God, there is no
    God!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>That cold terrible reception in Amsterdam was too much for
    me, my eyes were opened at last.</p>

    <p>Enough. Then Mauve diverted and encouraged me; I threw
    myself into my work with all my strength. Then toward the end
    of January, after I had been thrown over by Mauve and had been
    ill for a few days, I met Christine.</p>

    <p>Theo, you say that if I had really loved Kee, I shouldn't
    have done this. But do you understand better now that I
    couldn't go any further after what happened in Amsterdam -
    should I have despaired then? Why should an honest man despair
    - I am no criminal - I don't deserve to be treated in such an
    inhuman way. Well, what can they do this time? It's true they
    got the best of me, they thwarted me there in Amsterdam. But
    I'm not asking their advice any more now, and being of age, I
    ask you, Am I free to marry - yes or no? Am I free to put on a
    workman's clothes and live like a workman - yes or no? Whom am
    I responsible to, who will try to force me?</p>

    <p>To hell with anyone who wants to hinder me.</p>

    <p>You see, Theo, I've had enough of it all; think it over and
    you will understand. Is my path less straight because somebody
    says, &ldquo;You have gone astray&rdquo;? C. M. always talks
    about the right path too, just like Tersteeg and the clergymen.
    But C. M. also calls De Groux a bad character, so in the future
    I shall let him talk, my ears are tired of it. To forget, I lie
    down in the sand by an old tree trunk and make a drawing of it.
    In a linen smock, smoking a pipe and looking at the deep blue
    sky - or at the moss or the grass. This soothes me. And I feel
    just as calm, for instance, when Christien or her mother is
    posing, and I estimate the proportions, and try to suggest the
    body with its long undulating lines under the folds of a black
    dress. Then I am a thousand miles away from C. M., J. P. S.,
    and H. G. T., and much happier. But - alas, then the worries
    come and I must either talk or write about money, and then it
    all begins anew. Then I think T. and C. M. would do so much
    better if they didn't bother about my &ldquo;path,&rdquo; but
    encouraged my drawing.</p>

    <p>You will say C. M. does, but listen to why his order has not
    been filled as yet.</p>

    <p>Mauve said to me, That uncle of yours has only given this
    order because he was at your studio once; but you must
    understand that it doesn't mean anything and will be the first
    and last, and then nobody will take an interest in you. You
    must know, Theo, <i>that I cannot stand such things</i>; if
    such things are said, my hand drops as if paralyzed. Especially
    as C. M. has already said something about conventions, I
    believe. <label content="business.sales">I have done twelve drawings for C. M. for 30 guilders,
    that is 2.50 guilders apiece; it was a difficult job, there was
    more than 30 guilders' worth of work in it, and I don't deserve
    having to consider it charity, or something like it.</label></p>

    <p>I had already put a lot of effort into the six others. I had
    made the studies for them - and there it stopped. <i>The effort
    over the new ones has already been made</i>, so it is not
    laziness; but I am paralyzed.</p>

    <p>I reason with myself, I won't pay any attention to it. But
    I'm nervous and such a thing does not go away, but comes back
    when I try my hand at them again; so then I must steer another
    course and begin another work.</p>

    <p>I don't understand Mauve - it would have been kinder of him
    never to have meddled with me. <i>What do you advise me to do -
    make the drawings for</i> C. M. or not? I really don't know
    what to do.</p>

    <p>There used to be better feeling among painters; now they try
    to devour each other, and are big personages who have villas
    and scheme to get ahead. I would rather be on the Geest, or in
    any grey, muddy and gloomy alley - there I am never bored, so I
    say, That's no place for me, I won't go there any more.</p>

    <p>Thank God I have my work; but instead of earning money by
    it, I need money to be able to work, so that is the difficulty.
    When in a year - or I don't know how long - I shall be able to
    draw that Geest or any other street as I see it, with those
    figures of old women, workmen, girls, then Tersteeg, etc., will
    be very kind. But then they will hear me thunder, &ldquo;Go to
    hell&rdquo;; and I shall say, You deserted me when I was in
    trouble, friend, I don't know you, go away, you're standing in
    my light.</p>

    <p>Dear me, why should I be afraid, what do I care about
    Tersteeg's &ldquo;unsaleable&rdquo; or &ldquo;without
    charm&rdquo;? Whenever I feel depressed, I look at &ldquo;The
    Diggers&rdquo; by Millet and &ldquo;Le Blanc des Pauvres&rdquo;
    by De Groux, and then Tersteeg becomes so small, so
    insignificant, and all that drivel of his becomes so foolish,
    that my spirits rise, and I light my pipe and start drawing
    again. But if ever a &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; person should
    cross my path at such a moment, he might hear things which
    would sober him up.</p>

    <p>You will ask me, Theo, if these things are also applicable
    to you. My answer is, &ldquo;Theo, who has given me bread and
    helped me? I think you did, so it certainly is not applicable
    to you.&rdquo; But sometimes the thought occurs to me, Why
    isn't Theo a painter? Will that &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; ever
    begin to bore him? Won't he later regret that he has not left
    &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; for what it is worth, and has not
    learned a handicraft, taken a wife and put on the painter's
    smock? But there may be reasons for it which I cannot
    appreciate. I don't know whether you have yet learned the ABC
    of love. Do you think that pretentious of me? What I mean is,
    one feels best what love is when sitting by a sickbed,
    sometimes without any money in one's pocket. It is no gathering
    of strawberries in spring - that lasts only a few days, and
    most of the months are grey and gloomy. But in that gloom one
    learns something new; sometimes I think you know it and
    sometimes I think, He does not.</p>

    <p>I want to go through the joys and sorrows of domestic life
    in order to paint it from my own experience. When I came back
    from Amsterdam, I felt that my love - so true, so honest and
    strong - had literally been <i>killed</i>. But after death
    there is resurrection. Resurgam.</p>

    <p>Then I found Christine. There was no time to hesitate or to
    defer. I had to act. If I do not marry her, it would have been
    kinder of me to have left her alone. But a chasm will be opened
    by this step; I decidedly &ldquo;lower&rdquo; myself, as they
    say. But it isn't forbidden, it isn't wrong, though the world
    says so. I live as a labourer, it suits me; I wanted to before,
    but couldn't carry it out then. I hope that you will continue
    to stretch your hand across the chasm to me.</p>

    <p>I mentioned 150 fr. a month, you said that I should need
    more. Wait a minute, my average expenses have never exceeded
    100 fr. a month since I left Goupil except when I had to
    travel. And at first I had 30 guilders at Goupil's and later
    100 fr. a month.</p>

    <p>It's true that during these last months my expenses have
    been higher, but I had to set up housekeeping; and I ask you,
    were these expenses unreasonable or extravagant? Especially if
    you know what those expenses included. And how often in those
    long years did I have much less than 100 fr. And if I sometimes
    had travelling expenses, haven't I learned languages and
    developed my mind - is that money thrown away?</p>

    <p>Now I want to lay a straight path for my feet. If I postpone
    marriage, there is something crooked in my position which is
    repulsive to me. She and I will skimp and be as frugal as
    possible if only we can marry. I am thirty years old and she is
    thirty-two, so we are no longer children. As to her mother and
    her child, the latter takes away all stain from her; I respect
    a woman who is a mother, and I don't ask about her past. I am
    glad that she has a child - it gives her exactly the experience
    she needs.</p>

    <p>Her mother is very energetic and deserves a medal because
    she has supported a family of eight children for years. She
    doesn't want to be dependent, she makes her living as a
    charwoman.</p>

    <p>I am writing you late at night. Christine is not well, and
    the time for her to go to Leyden is at hand. You must excuse me
    if this letter is written badly, as I am very tired.</p>

    <p>But after receiving your letter, I wanted to write at
    once.</p>

    <p>The refusal in Amsterdam was so decisive, I was dismissed so
    cavalierly, that it would have been foolish to go on any
    longer.</p>

    <p>But ought I to have despaired then, jumped into the water or
    something? God forbid - I should have if I had been a wicked
    man. I have started a new life, not purposely, but because I
    had a chance to begin anew and did not refuse it.</p>

    <p>But now it's different, and Christine and I understand each
    other better. We don't have to pay attention to what people
    say; of course we don't pretend to maintain any social
    standing. Familiar as I am with the prejudices of the world, I
    know that what I have to do is retire from the sphere of my own
    class, which cast me out long ago anyhow. But that's all they
    can do, and they can't go any further. Maybe I will wait awhile
    before we set up housekeeping together anyway, because the
    circumstances are too difficult; but if I marry, I will do it
    quietly, without giving notice to anyone; if any remarks are
    made, I shall not pay attention to them. As she is a Roman
    Catholic, the wedding will be even simpler, for then of course
    the church is out of the question; neither she nor I want to
    have anything to do with it.</p>

    <p>You will say this is putting it bluntly - que soit.</p>

    <p>I only know one thing - drawing; and she has only one
    regular job - posing.</p>

    <p>I wish it were possible to take the house next to this; it
    is exactly the right size because the attic can be made into a
    bedroom and the studio is large and light - much better than
    the one here. But will it be possible? Even if I had only a
    hole to live in, I would rather have a crust of bread in my own
    home, however poor it might be, than live without marrying
    her.</p>

    <p>She knows what poverty is, so do I. Poverty has advantages
    and disadvantages, yet we shall risk it in spite of poverty.
    Fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm
    terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient to
    keep them ashore. They leave that philosophy to those who like
    it. Let the storm rise, the night descend - which is worse,
    danger or the fear of danger? Personally, I prefer reality, the
    danger itself.</p>

    <p>Adieu, Theo, it is late; don't be angry because of my
    letter; I am tired and yet I wanted to write. I wish you could
    understand it all and that I could express myself in a clearer
    and gentler way, but don't be offended by it, and believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I believe, or rather it begins to dawn on me, that there
    might be a shadow of a chance that the thought, &ldquo;Theo
    will withdraw his help if I contradict him,&rdquo; is perhaps
    quite unnecessary. But, Theo, I have seen such things happen so
    often that I shouldn't think less of you and shouldn't be angry
    with you if you did, because I would think, He doesn't know any
    better; they all act like that - from thoughtlessness, not
    malice.</p>

    <p>If I may keep your help, it would be something quite
    unexpected, good luck which I had not counted on, for I have
    lived with this terrible thought a long time, and Christine
    too, because I always told her, &ldquo;Lass, I fear there will
    come a time when I shall be left quite without means.&rdquo;
    But I did not tell it to you before the right moment had
    arrived. If you let me keep your help, that would be a relief,
    a blessing so unexpected, so unhoped for, that it would quite
    upset me with joy; even now I dare not think of it, and I put
    away the thought with all my strength, even while I write you
    about it with a steady hand, not to show my weakness. What I
    experienced last winter at Mauve's hands has been a lesson to
    me; it has kept me prepared for the worst - a death sentence
    from you - namely that you stop your help.</p>

    <p>You will say, But the help hasn't stopped - but I always
    receive it with certain reservations, thinking, He doesn't know
    yet what he will know one day; and I shall have no rest until
    the crisis comes, and I am prepared for the worst.</p>

    <p>Now the crisis has come and I cannot decide, I dare not hope
    yet. I said to Christine, I shall be able to help you until you
    go to Leyden. I don't know how you will find me, with or
    without bread, when you come back from Leyden, but I will share
    what I have with you and the child. Christine does not know any
    details, nor does she ask for them, but she knows I shall be
    frank with her, and she wants to stay with me quand bien
    m&ecirc;me.</p>

    <p>Until now I have always thought it probable that you would
    drop me as soon as you knew everything. So I have lived from
    day to day with a dark fear of the worst, which I don't dare
    think myself free of yet. I have also worked from day to day,
    not daring to order more drawing or painting materials than I
    could pay for, not daring to undertake any painting, not daring
    to push on as I would have if I could have counted on Mauve's
    and Tersteeg's sympathy. I thought that though their kindness
    was superficial, their unkindness was more deeply rooted; in
    short, I took Mauve's words &ldquo;that's all over&rdquo;
    seriously - not when he said them (for then my face showed
    nothing and I braved it, like the Indians who say, &ldquo;It
    doesn't hurt,&rdquo; when they are being tortured). But since I
    threw the plaster casts into the coalbin, he wrote me, &ldquo;I
    won't have anything to do with you for two months.&rdquo; Well,
    personally I always thought, I can't expect anything from Mauve
    or Tersteeg, and I shall thank God if Theo will continue to
    send me what's necessary until I can bring Christine safely to
    Leyden. Then I shall explain it to him and say, Stop, this is
    what I have done. Do you understand it - ?</p>

    <p>I am prepared for the worst - what's it to be? Speak
    plainly.</p>
