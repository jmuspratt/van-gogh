    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half September 1884</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I could not phrase my last letter differently than I did.
    But I want you to know that it always strikes me as being a
    difference between you and me imposed by fate, rather than one
    for which we ourselves are to blame.</p>

    <p>You tell me that within a short time there will be an
    exhibition of the work of Delacroix. All right. You will
    certainly see there a picture &ldquo;La Barricade,&rdquo; which
    I know only from biographies of Delacroix. I believe it was
    painted in 1848. [The reference is to Delacroix's <i>Liberty at
    the Barricades</i>, which in fact commemorated the rising of
    July 28th, 1830 and was shown at the Salon of 1831.] You also
    know a lithograph by De Lemud, I believe; if it is not by him,
    then by Daumier, also representing the barricade of 1848. I
    wish you could just imagine that you and I had lived in that
    year 1848, or some such period, for at the time of the coup
    d'etat by Napoleon there was again some-thing of the kind. I
    will not make any insinuations - that has never been my object
    - I try to make it clear to you to what degree the difference
    that has sprung up between us is connected with the general
    drift of society, and, as such, is some-thing quite different
    from premeditated reproaches. So take that period of 1848.</p>

    <p>Who were opposed to each other then, that can be taken as
    types of all the rest? Guizot, minister of Louis Philippe, on
    one side, Michelet and Quinet with the students on the
    other.</p>

    <p>I begin with Guizot and Louis Philippe, were they bad or
    tyrannical? Not exactly; in my opinion, they were people, like
    for instance Father and Grandfather, like old Goupil. In short,
    people with a very venerable appearance, deep - serious - but
    if one looks at them a little more closely and sharply, they
    have something gloomy, dull, stale, so much that it makes one
    sick. Is this saying too much???</p>

    <p>Except for a difference of position, they have the same
    mind, the same character. Am I mistaken in this?</p>

    <p>Now Quinet or Michelet, for instance, or Victor Hugo
    (later), was the difference between them and their opponents
    very great? Yes, but seen superficially one would not have said
    so. I myself have formerly admired at one and the same time a
    book by Guizot and a book by Michelet. But in my case, as I got
    deeper into it, <i>I</i> found difference and
    <i>contrast</i>, which is stronger still.</p>

    <p>In short, that the one comes to a dead end and disappears
    vaguely, and the other, on the contrary, has something
    infinite. Since then much has happened. But my opinion is, if
    you and I had lived <i>then</i>, you would have been on
    the Guizot side, and I on the side of Michelet. And both of us
    remaining set in our outlooks, with a certain melancholy, we
    might have stood as direct enemies opposite each other, for
    instance on such a barricade, you before it as a soldier of the
    government, I behind it, as revolutionist or rebel.</p>

    <p>Now, in 1884, <i>the digits happen to be the same only just
    reversed</i>, we are standing <i>again</i> opposite each
    other, though there are no barricades now. But minds that
    cannot agree are certainly still to be found.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Le moulin n'y est plus, mais le vent y est
    encore.&rdquo; [The mill is no more, but the wind remains.]</p>

    <p>And in my opinion we are in different camps opposite each
    other, that cannot be helped. And whether we like it or not,
    <i>you</i> must go on, <i>I</i> must go on. But as we are
    brothers, let us avoid killing each other for instance (in the
    figurative sense). But we cannot help each other as much as two
    people who are standing side by side in the same camp. No, if
    we come in each other's vicinity, we would be within each
    other's range. <i>My</i> sneers are bullets, not aimed at you
    who are my brother, but in general at the party to which you
    once and for all belong. Neither do I consider <i>your</i>
    sneers expressly aimed at me, but <i>you fire</i> at the
    barricade and think to gain merit by it, and I happen to be
    there.</p>

    <p>Think this over if you like, for I do not believe you can
    say much against it; I can only say that I believe things are
    so&hellip;</p>

    <p>I hope you will understand that I am speaking figuratively.
    Neither you nor I meddle with politics, but we live in the
    world, in society, and involuntarily ranks of people group
    themselves. Can the clouds help whether they belong to one
    thundershower or to another? whether they carry positive or
    negative electricity? Now it is also true that men are not
    clouds. As an individual, one is a part of all humanity. That
    humanity is divided into parties. How far is it one's own free
    will, how far is it the fatality of circumstances, that makes
    one belong to one party or to its opposite?</p>

    <p>Well, then it was &ldquo; '48, now it is '84,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;le moulin n'y est plus, mais le vent y est
    encore.&rdquo; But try to know for yourself where you really
    belong, as I try to know that for myself. Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p><label content="business.sales">It was mere chance that recently I happened to be asked to
    do a drawing or a painted study for 20 guilders. I acceded to
    this request, but seeing that I suspected (a suspicion which,
    on investigation, proved to be well founded) that Margot
    Begemann was behind it all, and that indirectly she wanted to
    make me a present of the money, I most resolutely refused to
    accept <i>payment</i>, but <i>not</i> to do the drawing, which
    I sent.</label> It is no easy matter, when one is sorely pressed for
    money, to refuse it. But it would have been a pons asinorum,
    and underhand expedient - so - instead of such underhand
    expedients - is there nothing better to do? I am convinced of
    it. For your sake as well as mine, and for the sake of many
    others, I wish that we had <i>Mourets</i> in the art trade, who
    would know how to create a <i>new</i> and <i>larger</i> buying
    public.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you will say: Isn't Tersteeg, for instance, a
    Mouret? Maybe he is after all. But however this may be, there
    are still other careers to be built up, simply because the
    public which is buying now can be multiplied by ten, and that
    every day this is becoming more necessary.</p>

    <p>If only a number of Mourets would come forward, who would
    buy and sell in a way different from the old routine, it would
    be excellent - then there would be more and more work to do.
    But if no Mourets came forward, then the trade may undergo a
    complete change because the painters themselves might put it on
    a new basis by starting permanent exhibitions without the old
    intermediary. I so much wish you knew and felt how young you
    are still, if only <i>you would act and be daring like a young
    man</i>.</p>

    <p>If you are no artist in painting then try to be an artist as
    a <i>dealer</i> like Mouret. As for myself - though at present
    I am on ne peut plus hard up - yet I feel that within a few
    years I shall blithely dare to undertake running up much bigger
    bills for colours and other things. I want to have a lot of
    work to do - believe me - and I don't intend to be bored -
    <i>do a great deal</i> or <i>drop dead</i>.</p>
