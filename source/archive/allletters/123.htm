  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I add a little word to Father's letter; I was glad to hear
    that you are getting on well in the foreign country and that
    you enjoy your life; how I should like to walk with you there
    sometime.</p>

    <p>I suppose Father has written you that we went to Brussels
    last week, along with the Reverend Mr. Jones, of Isleworth, who
    stayed the day here over Sunday.</p>

    <p>The impression of that journey was satisfactory in that we
    think I shall find my work there sometime - the course
    certainly is shorter and less expensive than in Holland; so it
    will be necessary to keep Belgium in mind and to look around
    there till we find something.</p>

    <p>We saw the Flemish training school; it has a three-year
    course, while, as you know, in Holland the study would last for
    six years more at the least. And they do not even require that
    you quite finish the course, before you can apply for a place
    as an evangelist. What is wanted is the talent to give popular
    and attractive lectures to people, more short and interesting
    than long and learned. So they require less knowledge of
    ancient language and less theological study (although
    everything one knows is an asset), but they value more highly
    fitness for practical work and the faith that comes from the
    heart.</p>

    <p>Still, there are many obstacles to overcome. First, one does
    not acquire at once, but only by long practice, the ability to
    speak to the people with seriousness and feeling, fluency and
    ease; what one says must have meaning and purpose and some
    persuasiveness to rouse one's listeners so that they will try
    to root their convictions in truth. In short, one must be a
    popular orator to succeed there.</p>

    <p>Ces meissieurs in Brussels wanted me to come for three
    months to become better acquainted, but that would again cause
    too much expense, and this must be avoided as much as possible.
    Therefore I am staying in Etten for the present, doing some
    preparatory work; from here I can occasionally visit both the
    Reverend Mr. Pietersen in Mechlin and the Reverend Mr. De Jong
    in Brussels, and in that way become mutually better acquainted.
    How long this will take depends entirely on what they will say
    over there. Father and I have just written them again.</p>

    <p>Now I will try to write as well as I can some compositions
    which will prove useful to me later; I am writing one now on
    Rembrandt's picture, &ldquo;The House of the Carpenter,&rdquo;
    in the Louvre. Yesterday Father had to preach in Zundert, and I
    went with him. The aunts send you their love. I was also at the
    house of Jan Doomen, who suffers much from rheumatism in his
    leg and complains that he cannot even walk to Breda any more;
    but when he is walking in the fields or the garden, it does not
    trouble him so much, except the pain forces him to get up very
    early in the morning. Old age is accompanied by many ailments,
    as the old Reverend Mr. Meyes used to say.</p>

    <p>What a beautiful, excellent wood engraving there was in
    L'Illustration the other day of &ldquo;A Young Citizen of the
    Year V&rdquo; by Jules Goupil - did you see it? I have got hold
    of it and it is hanging on the wall of the room which is my own
    now, namely the old schoolroom which looks out on the garden
    and where the ivy climbs up around the windows. This is what
    was written in the magazine about that picture: &rdquo;Un
    regard qui a vue le spectacle de l'affreuse guillotine, un
    pens&eacute;e qui a surv&eacute;cu &agrave; toutes les
    sc&egrave;nes de la r&eacute;volution. Il est presque
    &eacute;tonn&eacute; de se trouver encore vivantt apr&egrave;s
    tant de catastrophes&rdquo; [A look (in the eyes) that has seen
    the spectacle of the horrible guillotine, a way of thought that
    has survived all the scenes of the revolution. He is astonished
    to find that he is still alive after so many catastrophes]. It
    has been a remarkable feature in art and will continue to have
    a great influence on many people, and it will always have an
    attraction for those who have a keen sense for high art, just
    as, for instance, a portrait by Fabritus does, or some more or
    less mystical pictures of the Rembrandt school.</p>

    <p>That evening when we drove back from Zundert across the
    heath, Father and I got out and walked awhile. The sun was
    setting red behind the pine trees, and the evening sky was
    reflected in the pools; the heath and the yellow and white and
    grey sand were so full of harmony and sentiment - see, there
    are moments in life when everything, within us too, is full of
    peace and sentiment, and our whole life seems to be a path
    through the heath; but it is not always so.</p>

    <p>This morning I went with Cor, who is on vacation, to the
    heath and the pine wood way beyond the mill; we gathered
    heather for his rabbits, who seem to be very fond of it, and
    also enough to fill a flower basket. We sat for some time in
    the pine wood, and together we drew a little map of Etten and
    surroundings with the Bremberg, Sprundel, t' Heike and De
    Hoeve.</p>

    <p>Will you give my kindest regards to Soek and his family when
    you go there? Also to Frans Braat and Ernst and the others when
    you happen to see them. I often think of you, and am so glad
    that you are doing well and that you find things there which
    cheer you and feed your inner life. For this is what great art
    does, and the works of those who apply themselves heart, mind
    and soul - as do many whom you know and perhaps meet
    personally, whose words and deeds are full of spirit and
    life.</p>

    <p>A warm handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>The words on <art id=139_V-T_1230>the little map</art>, written by Cor, mean:
    &ldquo;Vincent and I did this in the pine wood - Cor - I must
    go to bed. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
