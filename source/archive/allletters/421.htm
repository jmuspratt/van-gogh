    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half August 1885</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>To my letter of the day before yesterday I want to add that
    yesterday I had a letter from Rappard, and that our quarrel is
    completely made up, that he has sent me a sketch of a large
    picture of a brickyard which he is painting. It looks very
    original; if you wanted to mention other pictures in the same
    style, it would be, for instance, Meunier, whose miners you saw
    in Antwerp.</p>

    <p>He has taken a small house outside Utrecht, close to the
    brickyard, nothing but a studio (with a skylight); he also
    intends to go back to Terschelling, so he is again quite
    absorbed in nature, and in my opinion that is better than
    working in the city.</p>

    <p>But I want to tell you that I hope we two shall also come to
    a better understanding. Just as little as I could accept his
    criticism can I be satisfied with the present condition in
    which my financial difficulties hamper my work too much. I
    don't want you to be the only one to put this right, but I
    simply want that we together (and not I alone) do our best to
    improve the situation. I know that it costs trouble and is not
    easy for you either, and as such I readily appreciate it; but
    to take trouble for a certain aim is no misfortune, and having
    to fight is essential to every honest victory.</p>

    <p>The expenses of painting cannot always be avoided, and not
    to make them is <i>not</i> always the best policy, for if one
    hesitated to take models or to buy the necessary painting
    materials, no serious work could result.</p>

    <p>And as things are getting worse and worse for me instead of
    better, they have finally got so bad that I really must
    complain.</p>

    <p>And I repeat, let's keep that little painting business of
    mine in good shape, for sooner or later we may need it badly.
    If a storm is threatening, one must keep the boats well
    trimmed.</p>

    <p>That man in The Hague is Leurs; he no longer lives in
    Practizijnshoek, but in Molenstraat.</p>

    <p>He begs me to send him more than one picture in order to
    have more than one chance, and he offers me his two show
    windows. And as he himself is very much in need of money, he
    will not spare any effort.</p>

    <p>I sent him a few cottages, <art id=0088>the old church tower</art> and some
    smaller studies with figures.</p>

    <p>And while these are on show, I shall make some new ones to
    keep things going.</p>

    <p>There is some chance of getting a second man at The Hague.
    But the main thing for me is to be able to go on with my work.
    Since you left, I have made another little picture of the
    harvest, the size of those carrot diggers in the snow - a
    reaper, a woman binding sheaves, and the mill, like those
    drawings you saw. An evening effect after sunset.</p>

    <p>I also made some studies on interiors.</p>

    <p>Once more I beg you to talk it over with Portier and Serret,
    to tell them that I am rather hard up, to stimulate them to do
    their best, that I for my part shall try to send them new
    things.</p>

    <p>And let us manage to send off the box.</p>

    <p>I have painted 3 more <art id=0097>studies of women</art> in <art id=0096>the potato fields</art>,
     of which you already saw the first one.</p>

    <p>Rappard had seen Wenkebach, and in his letter there was no
    longer any trace of the tone which he had tried to adopt at
    first. And though he is going to Terschelling first, he writes
    about coming to paint some studies here.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, and wishing you good luck,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
