  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>By chance I have at last seen something of Lhermitte's - a
    very careless reproduction in wood engraving. It represented a
    little old woman in a church pew. A girl was kneeling beside
    her. However imperfect the reproduction may be, it gave me some
    idea of his work. It immediately reminded me of De Groux and
    Legros - there certainly must be many things in common between
    his work and Millet's and Breton's.</p>

    <p>Careless though the little wood engraving was, it stayed in
    my mind for days, and I still think of it because some things I
    had heard about Lhermitte made me eager to see something of his
    work, and I was looking for it. You remember I wrote you about
    him apropos of a review of the &ldquo;Black and White&rdquo;
    exhibition.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I received the crayon - many thanks - it is very good. But
    it is softer than the kind you gave me the first time, and the
    pieces are half as long. I am still anxious to get that harder
    kind in larger pieces, but nevertheless I'm very glad to have
    this.</label></p>

    <p>I made a large drawing with it combined with lithographic
    crayon. It is a drawing of a digger - my model was the little
    old almshouse man you know already - his bald head, bent over
    the black earth, seemed to me full of a certain significance,
    reminiscent, for instance, of &ldquo;thou shalt eat thy bread
    in the sweat of thy brow.&rdquo; Now these drawings of the
    woman with the spade [JH 337] and this digger have such an
    aspect that people won't think they are made in some intricate
    way, but rather won't think about how they are made at all.</p>

    <p>But I believe that if I had made them with ordinary
    cont&eacute; pencil, they would have got a dull and ironlike
    aspect, which would have made people say a once, &ldquo;That's
    not life, that's not nature.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>By certain grey tints, through a certain richness and pith
    in the black, one avoids that dull and ironlike aspect.</p>

    <p>And these little things are, in my opinion, worth the
    trouble of looking for such material as that crayon and
    lithographic crayon.</p>

    <p>I am very glad you sent it.</p>

    <p>This morning a painter saw these two drawings, namely
    Nakken; he didn't intend to come to me, but knocked at my door,
    thinking that Van Deventer lived here - but he lives in another
    street. I straightened him out, but asked if he wouldn't come
    in and look at my studio, which he did. As I was drawing that
    digger mentioned above, it was the first thing he saw on the
    easel, and he said, &ldquo;That is vigorously drawn and
    seriously studied.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Take those words at their face value, without delving too
    deeply, yet they pleased me because I don't suppose Van Nakken
    would say that a figure was vigorously drawn if it weren't. But
    that's all I think of it - I am writing about it because it
    happened to be the drawing made with that crayon I mentioned,
    and you can tell that since you took the trouble to procure it
    for me, I for my part like nothing better than to work with
    it.</p>

    <p>Just how near such drawings would come to certain fusains -
    Lhermitte is an ideal - and to reach that point is still far
    distant - but to aim at it is the order of the day. Well, when
    you come sooner or later, we can talk about it better.</p>

    <p>Recently I spoke to Smulders about lithographs; I met him on
    the street, and he asked me if I didn't intend to make some
    more. Which is just what I should like to do. But I must talk
    it over with Rappard, and he must see my studies first.</p>

    <p>It always seems to me that one might make of workmen's
    figures something that has a raison d'&ecirc;tre.</p>

    <p>The lithographs by &Eacute;mile Vernier after Millet and
    Corot and Daubigny possess qualities which I appreciate highly.
    How one would like to talk with somebody who is a master of his
    trade to such a degree. Not with the intention of making
    reproductions of pictures, but to understand better what may be
    done in lithography.</p>

    <p>Just imagine original drawings with those characteristic
    greys and that peculiar expression of material. Bodmer has
    found that, as an artist, he is original, and at the same time,
    he has what one might call the lithographic tones, or rather
    the grey colour scale. Which is in some respects quite
    different from Gavarni's lithography. Bodmer's lithographs are
    prints finished like paintings. I refer here, not only to
    Bodmer's real lithographs like &ldquo;Au bas Breau&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;Combats de Cerfs&rdquo; [stags fighting], but also to
    the prints from Illustration, or Monde Illustr&eacute;. But in
    my opinion the respect for the need and longing for advice and
    correction by others may be no excuse for one's idleness. To
    say, &ldquo;I don't need other people,&rdquo; however, is rash,
    if one should systematically use it as a reason to stick one's
    nose up at other people.</p>

    <p>The act of printing has always seemed like a miracle to me,
    just such a miracle as a tiny seed's growth to an ear of corn.
    An everyday miracle, even greater for happening every day: one
    drawing is sown on the stone or the etching plate, and a
    harvest is reaped from it.</p>

    <p>Can you understand that it is something which I think about
    a great deal while I work, and that I feel a great love for it?
    Well, the main thing for me to do now is to see to it that the
    quality of the seed (namely the drawings themselves) improves;
    it may take more time, but if the harvest is better for it, I
    am satisfied - I always have my eye on that harvest.</p>

    <p>Well, write soon again, and believe me, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I kept this letter back a few days, as today, Sunday, I have
    more time for writing. I am reading Les Mis&eacute;rables by
    Victor Hugo. A book which I remember of old, but I had a great
    longing to read it again. It is very beautiful, that figure of
    Monseigneur Myriel or Bienvenu I think sublime.</p>

    <p>You spoke in your last letter of &ldquo;exerting
    influence&rdquo; in connection with your patient. That Mgr.
    Myriel reminds me of Corot or Millet, though he was a priest
    and the other two, painters. Because in the painters' world
    Corot, and Millet too, or Breton, besides doing their own work,
    have roused so much energy in others, who wouldn't have
    developed fully without them. You surely know Les
    Mis&eacute;rables, and certainly the illustrations which Brion
    made for it too, very good and very appropriate.</p>

    <p>It is good to read such a book again, I think, just to keep
    some feelings alive. Especially love for humanity, and the
    faith in, and consciousness of, something higher, in short,
    quelque chose l&agrave;-haut.</p>

    <p>I was absorbed in it for a few hours this afternoon, and
    then came into the studio about the time the sun was setting.
    From the window I looked down on a wide dark foreground -
    dug-up gardens and fields of warm black earth of a very deep
    tone. Diagonally across it runs a little path of yellowish
    sand, bordered with green grass and slender, spare young
    poplars. The background was formed by a grey silhouette of the
    city, with the round roof of the railway station, and spires,
    and chimneys. And moreover, backs of houses everywhere; but at
    that time of evening, everything is blended by the tone. So
    viewed in a large way, the whole thing is simply a foreground
    of black dug-up earth, a path across it, behind it a grey
    silhouette of the city, with spires, and over it all, almost at
    the horizon, the red sun. it was exactly like a page from Hugo,
    and I am sure that you would have been struck by it, and that
    you would describe it better than I. And on seeing it, I
    thought of you.</p>

    <p>I already wrote you that I made a drawing with that crayon -
    yesterday I began a second one with it, of <art id=1025>a seamstress</art>,
    <art id=1026>especially</art> for the chiaroscuro.
    When you come to the studio again, I think you will see pretty
    soon that, though I don't mention that plan of making workmen
    types for lithography so much any more, I still have it in
    mind. However, the fact is that I find it more and more
    difficult, in that I want to have my figures much better.</p>

    <p>I have <art id=853>a sower</art> - a mower - a woman at the washtub - a woman
    miner - a seamstress - a digger - a woman with a spade - the
    almshouse man - <art id=1002>a grace before meat</art> - a fellow with a
    wheelbarrow full of manure. There are even more, I suppose, but
    I think you will understand that just making them, looking at
    the models, and thinking it over do not make one satisfied with
    one's work; on the contrary - I mean, one says, Yes, that same
    thing, but even better and more serious.</p>

    <p>And I shouldn't think so much about it if I considered it
    impractical, but the fact that I have already done these
    drawings proves my longing to make them better is not just an
    abstract idea, but an actual struggle to achieve it.</p>

    <p>And I didn't make any further definite plan because I think
    the execution of the drawings much more interesting.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that these drawings all go straight in the
    direction which you meant when you wrote about it recently -
    though they are <i>far from equalling</i> those by Lhermitte.
    -</p>

    <p>You will understand that, too.</p>

    <p>Lhermitte's secret must be no other, I think, than that he
    knows the figure in general thoroughly - that is, the sturdy,
    stern workman's figure - and that he takes his subjects from
    the very heart of the people. To attain his level - one must
    not talk about that - one must work, and try to get as near as
    possible. Because talking about it would only be a presumption
    on my part, but working for it would be, on the contrary, a
    proof of respect and trust and faith in such artists as he.</p>

    <p>Have you ever seen anything by an American named Abbey? At
    present there is a draughtsmen's club in New York called the
    &ldquo;Tile Club&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Tile Painters&rdquo;; I
    saw a number of their illustrations, for instance, in a
    Christmas issue of Harper's. I ask you because all those
    gentlemen seem to have been in Paris at the same time - judging
    from a page of cartoons by one of them.</p>

    <p>In my opinion Abbey is by far the cleverest of them all. His
    figures often remind me somewhat of Boughton. Boughton is also
    a member, or an honorary member, of that club, but I think he
    himself is more serious than all the rest of the club put
    together, and doesn't make such a splash.</p>

    <p>Abbey, however, is very beautiful.</p>

    <p>I have a little figure of a woman in the snow by him, which
    simultaneously reminds me of Boughton and of Heilbuth.</p>

    <p>A large pen-and-ink drawing representing a Christmas scene
    in Washington's time, or a little earlier, recalls, for
    instance, Henri Pille. He has style, and that's a good thing,
    but Boughton has the same - he used to have it even more.</p>

    <p>I write about it because I believe you will agree with me
    that not all Americans are bad. That, on the contrary, there
    are extremes there like everywhere else, and besides a lot of
    braggarts and daubers of the most detestable and impossible
    kind, there are characters who give the effect of a lily or a
    snowdrop between the thorns.</p>

    <p>Now I will go and read a little in Les Mis&eacute;rables,
    though it is already late; such a book warms one the way
    pictures by Dupr&eacute; and old Millet's or some of Descamps'
    do - it is written with what we call fougue, vehemence.</p>

    <p>I saw that a new book is out by Zola, Au Bonheur des Dames,
    if I remember correctly.</p>
