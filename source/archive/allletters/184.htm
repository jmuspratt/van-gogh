  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have sat down to write you several times, but I couldn't
    bring myself to finish the letter. The reason was that I wanted
    to write about several things which had made me think the
    necessity of your becoming a painter so very evident. But what
    I had written wasn't quite right, and I couldn't find words
    strong enough.</p>

    <p>Your objections are true, but on the other hand there are
    many other things which counterbalance them. By thirty you
    would have made such progress that people would have to
    acknowledge you as a painter and value your work. And at thirty
    you will still be young.</p>

    <p>What you have learned at Goupil's, your knowledge of many
    things, will simply enable you to overtake many who
    &ldquo;started early.&rdquo; For those early beginners often
    have a sterile period, remaining on the same level for years;
    someone who begins energetically later on need not go through
    such a period.</p>

    <p>Painting is a profession in which one can earn a living just
    as well as a blacksmith or a physician. At all events an artist
    is the exact opposite of a man who lives on his income, and I
    repeat, if one wants to make a comparison, there is more
    similarity between an artist and either a blacksmith or a
    physician.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I remember quite well, now that you write about it, that at
    the time when you spoke of my becoming a painter, I thought it
    very impractical and would not hear of it. What made me stop
    doubting was reading a clear book on perspective, Cassange's
    Guide to the ABC of Drawing; and a week later I drew the
    interior of a kitchen with stove, chair, table and window - in
    their places and on their legs - whereas before it had seemed
    to me that getting depth and the right perspective into a
    drawing was witchcraft or pure chance.</label> If only you drew one
    thing right, you would feel an irresistible longing to draw a
    thousand other things. But one sheep has to cross the bridge to
    get the others to follow.</p>

    <p>If a painter seized you by the arm and said, Look, Theo, you
    must draw that field like this: the lines of the furrows go
    this way, for such and such reasons and no other; they are
    brought into perspective this way. And that pollard willow
    being <i>so</i> tall, the other one higher up is <i>so</i>
    small, and you can measure the difference in size in this way.
    Look, when you hammer that onto the paper, those lines will be
    correct, and you have a solid foundation under your feet on
    which to work.</p>

    <p>Such a conversation, provided he can put his theory into
    practice, would be much more effective in my case than many
    talks on either abstract or financial matters. I will not
    continue that train of thought much longer, but you are just on
    the verge of someday getting an insight into this practice, and
    if you happen to draw something correctly - in other words, if
    you learn to see the perspective of things - then you will be
    through with art dealing and will feel, like Correggio, I too
    am a painter. At the same time you will see that you are in
    your element, and then - then you will be younger and more
    hopeful than ever before; then your second youth begins: it is
    better than the first, for, thank God, the second one does not
    pass away - does not pass away like the first. For my first
    youth is gone, and yours will soon be gone too.</p>

    <p>As to Cor's education or Mother's support, the money for
    these two things will not be lacking, even if you become a
    painter. And as to yourself, your food, drink, sleep, your
    studio, your model&hellip;they are not far off; if the thought
    of painting should be aroused in you, you would see that it can
    be done.</p>

    <p>But so that you won't suspect me of overlooking the
    financial end, I should like to say - though with all respect
    for your present position as a dealer - unless one has a real
    handicraft and can make something with one's own hands, I doubt
    the soundness of the position. For instance, I think Jaap
    Maris's social position sounder and more independent than
    Tersteeg's. I have great respect for thought and intelligence;
    where these are wanting, one will be ruined in spite of one's
    handicraft because one cannot make a firm stand and defend
    one's own work, as is proved by Thijs Maris. But people who
    possess thought and intelligence, and of course I count you
    among them and should also like to count myself among them, are
    the best fitted for handicraft.</p>

    <p>To sum up. If you take up painting, you will succeed, and at
    about your thirtieth year you will have a good position as a
    painter - anyway, no worse than the one you have now. If you
    begin to paint, you will certainly not be a mediocrity in the
    bad sense of the word.</p>

    <p>Now, I see a chance of making my money do if you can arrange
    to send another 100 fr. about the middle of this month; it will
    last me until the beginning of May. I have not been able to pay
    Tersteeg out of the 100 fr. you just sent me: I have so many
    expenses, and, for instance, I could no longer put off paying
    the rent or buying a pair of trousers. If you send again about
    the middle of April, I <i>can</i> return it to him then (and
    will do so if you insist). But I would rather make a drawing
    for it sometime. I must not do it this way - I must not pay
    cash to <i>dealers</i>. My debt to you is different, we don't
    know how things will go. If you remain an art dealer, you will
    get drawings and pictures for it in time; if you become a
    painter, I will pay you back the money with interest into the
    bargain.</p>

    <p>As to the money for Tersteeg, when I first arrived here, he
    and Mauve were so kind and said I need not worry; but in less
    than a month they suddenly changed and spoke quite differently,
    thinking perhaps that I should give up. At first it hurt me,
    and then later it left me rather cold, and I thought, I will
    try not to mind.</p>

    <p>Breitner is in the hospital; I visit him now and then to
    bring him either books or drawing materials. C. M. has paid me
    and given me a new order, but a very difficult one - six
    special detailed views of the town. However, I will try to make
    them, for if I understand it correctly, I shall get as much for
    these six as for the first twelve. And later perhaps he will
    still want some sketches of Amsterdam.</p>

    <p>Blommers came to see me about the exhibition of wood
    engravings. He looked at them for three hours and was angry at
    the committee of Pulchri for saying something like,
    &ldquo;Those things one sees now and then in the South Holland
    caf&eacute;.&rdquo; If that's all they know about wood
    engravings, they are indeed competent to judge them! However,
    Pulchri had objections. But Blommers wants to have his way, and
    has asked me to keep them ready for next Saturday. It is very
    curious to hear some painters talk about what they call
    &ldquo;illustrators,&rdquo; about Gavarni, for instance, or
    Herkomer. <i>Not</i> knowing anything about the matter is what
    makes up part of their so-called <i>general information</i>.
    Much good may it do them. With a handshake</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">My thanks for the package of splendid Ingres paper and for
    the studies.</label> Perhaps someday when people begin to say that I
    can draw a little but not paint, I shall suddenly come out with
    a picture at a moment when they least expect it. But I
    certainly won't as long as it looks as though I were
    <i>obliged</i> to, and as though <i>I must not</i> do something
    else.</p>

    <p>There are two ways of thinking about painting, how not to do
    it and how to do it: <i>how to do it</i> - with much drawing
    and little colour; <i>how not to do it</i> - with much colour
    and little drawing.</p>
