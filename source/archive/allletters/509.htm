  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just send off to you by post<art id=1447> a</art> <art id=add3>roll</art>
    containing<art id=1424> five</art> big pen drawings. You have a sixth of that series from Mont
    Majour - <art id=1452>a group of very dark pines and the town of Arles in
    the background</art>. Afterward I want to add a
    <art id=1446>view of the whole of the ruins</art> (you have <art id=1417>a hurried scratch of
    it</art> among the small drawings).</p>

    <p>Since I cannot help at all with money just at this moment
    when we are entering this combination with Gauguin, I have done
    all I could to show through my work that I have had the plan at
    heart. In my opinion the two views of the Crau and of the
    country on the banks of the Rh&ocirc;ne are the best things I
    have done in pen and ink. <label content="business.selling">If Thomas should happen to want them,
    he cannot have them for less than 100 fr. each. Even if in that
    case I had to <i>make him a present</i> of the <i>three</i>
    others, as we must get some money. But we cannot give them for
    less.</label> Not everyone would have the patience to get themselves
    devoured by mosquitoes and to struggle against the nagging
    malice of this constant mistral, not to mention that <label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">I have
    spent whole days outside with a little bread and milk, since it
    was too far to go back to the town every once in a while.</label></p>

    <p>I have already said more than once how much the Camargue and
    the Crau, except for the difference in colour and in the
    clearness of the atmosphere, remind me of the old Holland of
    Ruysdael's time. I think that these two I've spoken of, the
    flat countryside covered with vines and stubble fields, seen
    from a height, will give you an idea of it.</p>

    <p>Believe me I am tired out by these drawings. I have begun a
    painting as well, but there is no way of doing it with the
    mistral blowing - there's absolutely nothing doing.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">Well now, about this canvas, I have compared Tasset's new
    canvas at 4.50 fr. with the price of the same quality at
    Bourgeois' (I ferreted out the price of the ordinary canvas as
    40 fr. for 20 square meters from his catalogue). Well, once
    more Tasset has been no more expensive, it was <i>exactly</i>
    the same price. It follows that in just the same way we ought
    to be able to get the ordinary canvas from Tasset at 2 francs
    the square meter, and in the future we could do well to get
    this, for it is certainly good enough for the studies.</label></p>

    <p>Please let me have a line at once to say if the drawings
    have arrived in good condition. They swore at me again at the
    post office because they were too big, and I am afraid perhaps
    they may make trouble in Paris. They took them, however, I was
    glad of that, because after the celebrations of July 14 you may
    be pleased to refresh your eyes with the wide-open spaces of
    the Crau.</p>

    <p>The fascination that these huge plains have for me is very
    strong, so that I felt no <i>weariness</i>, in spite of the
    really wearisome circumstances, mistral and mosquitoes. If a
    view makes you forget these little annoyances, it must have
    something in it. You will see, however, that there is no
    attempt at effect. At first sight it is like a map, a strategic
    plan as far as the <i>execution</i> goes. Besides, I walked
    there <i>with a painter</i>, and he said, &ldquo;There is
    something that would be boring to paint.&rdquo; Yet I went
    fully fifty times to Mont Majour to look at this flat
    landscape, and was I wrong? I went for a walk there with
    someone else who was <i>not a painter</i>, and when I said to
    him, &ldquo;Look, to me that is as beautiful and as infinite as
    the sea,&rdquo; he said - and he knows the sea - &ldquo;For my
    part I like this <i>better</i> than the sea, because it is no
    less infinite, and yet you feel that it is
    <i>inhabited</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>What a picture I would make of it if there was not this damn
    wind. That is the maddening thing here, no matter where you set
    up your easel. And that is largely why the painted studies are
    not so finished as the drawings; the canvas is shaking all the
    time.</p>

    <p>It does not bother me when I am drawing.</p>

    <p>Have you read Mme. Chrysanth&egrave;me? It gave me the
    impression that the real Japanese have <i>nothing on their
    walls</i>, that description of the cloister or pagoda where
    there was <i>nothing</i> (the drawings and curiosities all
    being hidden in the drawers). That is how you must look at
    Japanese art, in a very bright room, quite bare, and open to
    the country.</p>

    <p>Would you like to experiment with these two drawings of <art id=1420>the
    Crau</art> and the banks of the Rh&ocirc;ne, <i>which do not look
    Japanese</i>, but which really are, perhaps more so than some
    others? Look at them in some caf&eacute; where it's clear and
    blue and nothing else in the way, or else outside. Perhaps they
    need a reed frame, like a thin stick. Here I work in a bare
    room, four white walls and a red paved floor. If I urge you to
    look at these two drawings in this way, it is because I so much
    want to give you a <i>true idea</i> of the simplicity of nature
    here. Well, as to Gauguin, suppose we show the drawings, and
    <art id=1484>the harvest</art> too, and <art id=1443>the Zouave</art>, to Thomas?</p>

    <p>A handshake, and thank you for the two tubes of zinc white
    that Tasset has just sent. I am curious to know if Mourier will
    remember the spots.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
