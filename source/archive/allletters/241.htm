  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Your letter and its contents were very welcome to me. The
    question you refer to will perhaps become more and more urgent.
    People will be obliged to acknowledge that many a new thing in
    which one at first thought to find progress proves in fact to
    be less sound than the old ones, and in consequence the need
    for strong men to redress things will manifest itself. As
    arguing about this can do little good, I think it rather
    superfluous to write more about it.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">But I can hardly say that I share your thought which you
    express in the following words: &ldquo;To me it seems quite
    natural that the desired change will occur.&rdquo; Just think
    how many great men are dead or will not be with us for long -
    Millet, Brion, Troyon, Rousseau, Daubigny, Corot - so many
    others are no longer among the living; think further back,
    Leys, Gavarni, de Groux (I name only a few), still further
    back, Ingres, Delacroix and G&eacute;ricault, think how old
    <i>modern art</i> already is, add many others as well who have
    already reached old age.</p>

    <p>Up to Millet and Jules Breton, however, there was always in
    my opinion progress, but to surpass these two - don't even
    mention it.</label></p>

    <p>Their genius may be equalled in former, present or later
    times, but to surpass it is not possible. In that high range
    there is an equality of genius, but higher than the top of the
    mountain one cannot climb. Isra&euml;ls, for instance, may
    equal Millet, but among genius superiority or inferiority is
    out of the question.</p>

    <p>Now in the realm of art the summit has been reached.
    Certainly we shall still see beautiful things in the years to
    come, but anything more sublime than we have seen already - no.
    And I for my part am afraid that perhaps in a few years there
    will be a kind of <i>panic</i> in this regard. Since
    <i>Millet</i> we have greatly deteriorated; the word decadence,
    now whispered or pronounced in covert terms,
    (<i>see</i> Herkomer) will then sound as an alarm bell.
    Many an one, for instance I myself, keeps quiet now because one
    is already labelled as a <i>mauvais coucheur</i>, and to
    speak about it doesn't help. Speaking about it, that is to
    say, is not what one ought to do, one must work, even if it be
    with a sorrowful heart; those who will subsequently cry the
    hardest about decadence will be the most decadent themselves. I
    repeat - &ldquo; By these fruits ye shall know them,&rdquo; by
    their work, nor will it be the most eloquent who will say the
    truest things, look at Millet himself, look at Herkomer; they
    are indeed no orators and they speak almost <i>&agrave; contre
    c&oelig;ur</i>.</p>

    <p>Enough of this, I find in you someone who understands many
    of the great men, and I think it delightful to hear now and
    then things about them which I did not know; for instance, what
    you tell me about Daumier. The series of portraits of
    deputies, etc., the pictures &ldquo;Third Class Railway
    Carriage,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Revolution,&rdquo; I know none of
    them. It is true that your writing doesn't make me see them
    myself, but in my imagination Daumier's personality becomes
    more important as a result of it. I prefer to hear about such
    men more than, for instance, about the last Salon.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">Now what you write about the <i>Vie Moderne,</i> or rather
    about the kind of paper that Buhot promised you, - this is
    something which interests me very much. Do I understand rightly
    that this paper is such that when one makes a drawing on it (I
    suppose with autographic ink) this drawing <i>just as it
    is</i>, without the intermediary of a second draughtsman or
    engraver or lithographer, can be transferred on to a stone, or
    a clich&eacute; can be made of it, so that an indefinite number
    of copies can be pulled? - the latter then being facsimiles of
    the original drawing. If this is so, be so kind then as to give
    me all information you can pick up about the way in which one
    has to work on this paper, and try to get me some of it, so
    that I can give it a trial.</label></p>

    <p>If I could have a trial before you come, we might on that
    occasion consult about what we can do with it.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I think it possible that within a relatively short time
    there will perhaps be a greater demand for illustrators than
    there is at present.</p>

    <p>As for me, if I fill my portfolios with studies from every
    model I can get hold of, I will have enough of a skill to hope
    to get employment. <i>To keep</i> illustrating, as did for
    instance Morin, Lan&ccedil;on, Renouard, Jules Ferat, Worms in
    their times, one needs quite a lot of ammunition, in the form
    of different studies of all kinds of subjects.</label></p>

    <p>Those I try to get together, as you know, and as you will
    see when you come.</p>

    <p>By the by, I have not so far received the package of
    studies, which according to your letter you returned to me via
    the Rue Chaptal. Do you think they have already arrived at the
    Plaats? If you think so I will send for them, as they will be
    of use to me in connection with things which I have recently
    produced.</p>

    <p>Do you know whose portrait I drew this morning? <art id=993>Blok, the
    Jewish book dealer</art> - not David, but the little one who stands
    on the Binnenhof.</p>

    <p>I wish I could draw more members of that family, for they
    are real good types.</p>

    <p>It's awfully difficult to get the types that one likes best;
    meanwhile I think I'm right in working on <i>those I can
    get</i>, without losing sight of those I would draw if only I
    could get them.</p>

    <p>I am very glad about Blok, he reminds me of things from many
    years ago. I hope he will come again some Sunday morning.</p>

    <p>Of course one always feels, and one must feel, when at work,
    a kind of dissatisfaction with oneself, a longing to do it much
    better; but still it is delightful and comforting little by
    little to get a collection of all kinds of figures together,
    though the more one makes the more one wants to make.</p>

    <p>One cannot do everything at once, but it will be absolutely
    necessary for me to make a number of horse studies, not only
    just scratches made in the street, but to take a model for
    them. I know an old white horse, just the poorest nag
    imaginable (at the gas-works); but the man, who lets the poor
    beast do the hardest possible jobs, and draws from it what he
    can get, asked me a lot for it, namely, three guilders a
    morning to come to me and one guilder and a half at least to
    come to him, but then it must be on a Sunday.</p>

    <p>And when you consider that to get what I need, about thirty
    large studies for instance, I should have to work many a
    morning, it would prove to be too expensive. But I shall get a
    better chance some time.</p>

    <p>I can get a horse here and there easily enough for a <i>very
    short</i> time, people are willing enough for that
    occasionally; but one <i>cannot</i> in a very short time do
    what really must be done, so that does not help me much.</p>

    <p>I try to work quickly, for that is necessary, but a study
    that is of any use requires at least half an hour, on average,
    so one always falls back on to real posing. At Scheveningen,
    for instance, on the beach, I have had a boy or man standing
    for me for a moment, as they call it; the result was always a
    great longing in me for a longer pose, and the mere standing
    still of a man or a horse doesn't satisfy me.</p>

    <p>If I am properly informed, the draughtsmen for the Graphic
    could always turn by turn find a model at their disposal in a
    studio at the office. Dickens tells a few good things about the
    painters of <i>his</i> time and their wrong way of working,
    namely, their following the model servilely, yet only half-way.
    He says: "Fellows, try to understand that your model is
    <i>not</i> your final aim, but <i>the means of giving form and
    strength to your thought and inspiration</i>. Look at
    the French (for instance, Ary Scheffer) and see how much better
    they do it than you do." It seems the English listened to him;
    <i>they</i> continued working with the model, but they have
    learned to view the model in a broader, stronger way and to use
    it for healthier, nobler compositions than those of the
    painters of Dickens's time.</p>

    <p>Two things that in my opinion reinforce one another and
    remain eternally true are: Do not quench your inspiration and
    your imagination, do not become the slave of your model; and
    again: Take the model and study it, otherwise your inspiration
    will never become plastically concrete.</p>

    <p>When your letter came, I immediately had many things to pay
    for. I hope it will not inconvenience you to send again not
    later than the 10th of November. That question of the process
    about which Buhot spoke to you seems very important to me, you
    know. I shall be very happy to learn it and will try my best to
    do so.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Do you know what effects one sees here at present early in
    the morning? - it is splendid - the sort that Brion painted in
    his picture at the Luxembourg: "The End of the Deluge," namely
    that streak of red light on the horizon with rain clouds over
    it. This brings me to the landscape painters. Compare those of
    the time of Brion with the contemporaries. Is it better now? I
    doubt it.</p>

    <p>I will readily acknowledge that they are more productive
    now, but though I cannot help admiring what is produced now,
    the old landscapes done in a more old-fashioned way please me
    whenever I see them. There was a time for instance when I
    passed a Schelfhout thinking: that's not worth while.</p>

    <p>But the modern way, though it has its attraction, doesn't
    make that strong, deep, durable impression, and when one has
    been looking for a long time at new things, one sees again with
    great pleasure a naive picture like a Schelfhout or a
    S&eacute;g&eacute;, a Jules Bakhuysen. It is really not
    intentionally that I feel rather disenchanted about the
    progress, on the contrary quite against my will; the feeling
    involuntarily entered my thoughts, because I feel more and more
    a kind of void, which I cannot fill with the things of
    today.</p>

    <p>While looking for an example, I happened to think of some
    old woodcuts by Jacque, which I saw at least ten years ago at
    Uncle Cor's; it was a series called &ldquo;The Months,&rdquo;
    done in the manner of those etchings which appeared in yearly
    series, or even more old-fashioned still. There is less of the
    local tone in it than in his later work, but the drawing and an
    element of pithiness remind one of Millet. Look here, in the
    many sketches in today's magazines, it seems to me that a
    <i>not</i> quite unconventional elegance threatens to replace
    that typical, real rusticity of which the sketches of Jacque,
    which I mentioned, are an example.</p>

    <p>Don't you think the cause of this lies also in the life and
    personality of the artists? I do not know your experience, but
    do you find, for instance at present, many people who like to
    take a lengthy walk in grey weather? You yourself would love it
    and enjoy it as I do, but for many people it would be
    unattractive. It also struck me that when one talks with
    painters, the conversation in most cases <i>is not</i>
    interesting. Mauve has at times the great power of describing a
    thing in such words that one sees it, and certainly others have
    that too, when they want to. But that peculiar open-air feeling
    when you speak to a painter - do you think it is as strong as
    it used to be?</p>

    <p>I read this week in Forster's Life of Charles Dickens all
    kinds of particulars about long walks on Hampstead Heath, etc.,
    outside London, with the object for instance of eating bacon
    and eggs in a little old inn far away, well out in the country.
    Those walks were very pleasant and merry, but for all that it
    was generally in this way that serious plans were made for
    books, or discussions were held about what changes Dickens
    should make in this or that figure. There is nowadays a hurry
    and bustle in everything that doesn't please me, and it seems
    as if the joy has gone out of most things. I wish your
    expectation would come true: "that the desired change will
    come," but to me it doesn't seem &ldquo;quite
    natural.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>However this may be, it is of very little use to fight back
    in words, I think, and the thing for everyone to do who has an
    interest in the matter is to try in his little circle to make
    something or to help make something.</p>

    <p>I worked again on <art id=994>a watercolour of miners' wives carrying
    bags of coal through the snow</art>. But especially I
    drew about twelve studies of figures for it and three heads,
    and I am not ready yet. In the watercolour I think I found the
    proper effect, but I do not think it broad enough of character.
    In reality it is something like &ldquo;The Reapers&rdquo; by
    Millet, severe, so you understand that one mustn't make a snow
    effect of it, which would be merely an impression and would
    only then have its raison d'&ecirc;tre if it were done by way
    of a landscape. I think I will start afresh, though I believe
    the studies that I have at the moment will please you, because
    they succeeded better than many others. It would really be fit
    for the Vie Moderne<i>,</i> I think. When I get the paper I
    shall anyhow have <i>one</i> of the figures to try out, but it
    must become a group of women, a small caravan.</p>
