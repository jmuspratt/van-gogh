  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><art id=0125>Yesterday I brought home that study of the water mill at
    Gennep</art>, which I painted with pleasure, and
    which has procured me a new friend in Eindhoven [Anton
    Kerssemakers], who passionately wants to learn to paint, and to
    whom I paid a visit, after which we set to work at once. So
    that very evening he had already brushed a still life, and he
    has promised me he will try to paint about thirty of them this
    winter, which I will come and look at now and then, and help
    him to make. He is a tanner who has time and money, and is
    about 40 years old, so he has more chances than Hermans, who
    wonderfully keeps up his ardour for all that, however, and
    works just as hard as he did the first days, i.e. gives almost
    <i>all</i> his time to it. I think this new fellow will soon
    get an eye for colour.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I intend to make these people gradually pay, not in money,
    but by telling them, You must give me <i>tubes of paint</i>.
    For I want to paint a lot - continually, and I want to manage
    so that I no longer need work at <i>half speed</i>, but can
    paint from morning till night.</label></p>

    <p>You must not suppose that I am so eager for people to
    approve of my work and my actions in general. On the contrary,
    for the moment, for instance, I am almost more glad that Mauve
    and Tersteeg have refused me than if it had been the reverse.
    Understand me well! It is because I feel within me the power to
    win them over in the end, notwithstanding everything.</p>

    <p>I should not have applied to them again if I didn't feel
    that I had gained a fixed point by drudging these last years on
    the ABC of drawing and painting - drudging harder than they can
    imagine - and I should not have started a new fight if I didn't
    feel sure of the <i>possibility</i> of winning it.</p>

    <p>I am not sure of the certainty of winning it, however, but I
    dare speculate on its chance, so I am none the worse for it now
    that I have begun to appeal to the public. In the very fight I
    shall feel my strength grow, and I shall learn more by
    criticism, by ill will, even by opposition, than by
    resignation.</p>

    <p>But those things I mentioned to you - I must insist,
    decidedly insist on. I have set myself the task of making a
    certain number of studies, for which I lack the money, no
    matter how I calculate, and yet I cannot put them off for any
    reason on earth. New Year's is at hand; I have to pay a few
    things about that time, and I have already paid some off this
    month. But in this way I run short of money for my work, and if
    I don't find something extra, I shall lose a month's work, and
    under the circumstances that <i>must</i> not be; do try your
    very utmost to obtain an extra 100 francs for me.</p>

    <p>I, for my part, will also try to get a contribution of
    colours from the people whom I give lessons to.</p>

    <p>I hope you will feel that just because of my appeal to Mauve
    and Tersteeg and their refusing, directly or indirectly I must
    show very shortly that I have again accomplished something -
    and that all energy must now be concentrated, and that work
    must be done at full speed, though it might turn out a little
    more expensive. That will be amortized, and I stick to what I
    said, in the future we must manage to get at least a good
    interest from the capital invested.</p>

    <p>A change has come into my colour since you were here; I
    already had a presentiment of it when you were here, and you
    will see that - <i>with some more studies, those which I am
    writing about now, which must be finished within a couple of
    months</i> - it will be proved beyond a doubt that, exactly in
    the matter of colour, I have achieved something. It is not my
    fault, but at the moment I am short of money, just because I
    have painted more than I could really afford, and there
    <i>can</i> be no economizing now, for we can gain important
    points by striking while the iron is hot. I remember having
    said in my last letter: &ldquo;that I no longer care what your
    opinion is&rdquo;; I don't mean that as rudely as it sounds, I
    only mean that in some respects I have decided to push on with
    passion rather than prudence, because this is more in
    character, and, after all, I cannot put up with those cool
    calculations. And yet I <i>calculate too</i>. The extra I ask -
    I don't ask it at once, but look at what I mean. Try to send 20
    francs extra about November 20, then the ordinary amount on
    December 1, another 20 francs extra about December 20, and the
    same in January. Then I shall be able to make both ends meet
    during those months, and need not stop for days when the work
    requires my not losing a moment.</p>

    <p>If it can be a little more, so much the better, but try at
    least to do what I just asked.</p>

    <p>And I for my part can perhaps get something in the form of
    tubes of colour from that new acquaintance.</p>

    <p>I don't think I am mistaken in regard to Tersteeg and Mauve
    when I venture to say there is certainly a chance of getting at
    them and winning them over. They may be won over by colour, and
    by working hard. I see a chance of giving them convincing proof
    that I have a notion of, and sentiment for, colour. And then
    portraits are more and more in demand, and there are not so
    very many who can do them, and I want to try to learn to paint
    a head with character; I have just recently become enthusiastic
    about it, because my idea of colour has become firmer. You need
    not meddle at once in that affair of Tersteeg and Mauve,
    <i>rather spare yourself</i>, but when for instance I have
    those projected 50 heads ready by the end of January, then it
    might be well if <i>you unexpectedly</i> said a few words to
    them.</p>

    <p>Hermans has, after all, positively promised to give me the
    money for a trip somewhere, but with a return ticket. If I want
    to go to Antwerp, I can take him at his word, and this winter I
    will manage to try to get some connections there, though that
    may not succeed all at once either.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, be sure to send me 20 francs by November 20, to
    keep me going till the end of the month. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
