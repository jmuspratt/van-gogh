  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I spent yesterday with the Belgian, who also has a sister
    among the &ldquo;vingtistes.&rdquo; The weather was not fine,
    but a very good day for talking; we went for a walk and anyway
    saw some very fine things at the bullfight and outside the
    town. <label content="business.co-op">We talked more seriously about the plan, that if I keep a
    place in the south, he ought to set up a sort of post among the
    collieries. Then Gauguin and I and he, if the importance of a
    picture made it worth the journey, could change places - and so
    be sometimes in the north, but in familiar country with a
    friend in it, and sometimes in the south.</label></p>

    <p>You will soon see him, this young man with the look of
    Dante, because he is going to Paris, and if you put him up - if
    the room is free - you will be doing him a good turn; he is
    very distinguished in appearance, and will become so, I think,
    in his painting.</p>

    <p>He likes Delacroix, and we talked a lot about Delacroix
    yesterday. He even knew the violent study for the &ldquo;Bark
    of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, thanks to him I have at last <art id=0462>a first sketch of that
    picture which I have dreamt of for so long - the poet</art>. He posed
    for me. His line head with that keen gaze stands out in my
    portrait against a starry sky of deep ultramarine; for clothes,
    a short yellow coat, a collar of unbleached linen, and spotted
    tie. He gave me two sittings in one day.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.sisters">Yesterday I had a letter from our sister, who has seen a
    great deal. Ah, if she could marry an artist it would not be so
    bad. Well, we must go on inducing her to develop her
    personality rather than her artistic abilities.</label></p>

    <p>I have finished L'Immortel by Daudet. I rather like the
    saying of the sculptor V&eacute;drine, that to achieve fame is
    something like ramming the lighted end of your cigar into your
    mouth when you are smoking. But I certainly like L'Immortel
    less, far less than Tartarin.</p>

    <p>You know, it seems to me that L'Immortel is not so fine in
    colour as Tartarin, because it reminds me with its mass of true
    and subtle observations of the dreary pictures of Jean
    B&eacute;rend which are so dry and cold. Now Tartarin is
    <i>really great</i>, with the greatness of a masterpiece, just
    like Candide.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I do strongly ask you to keep my studies of this place as
    open to the air as possible, because they are not yet
    thoroughly dry. If they remain shut up or in the dark the
    colours will get devalued</label>. So the<art id=0431> portrait of &ldquo;The Young
    Girl,&rdquo;</art> <art id=0412>&ldquo;The Harvest&rdquo;</art>(a wide
    landscape with the ruin in the background and the line of the
    Alpilles), the<art id=0417> little &ldquo;Seascape,&rdquo;</art> <art id=0428>the
    &ldquo;Garden&rdquo; with the weeping tree and clumps of
    conifers</art>, if you could put these on stretchers
    it would be well. I am rather keen on those. You will easily
    see by the drawing of the little seascape that it is the most
    thought out.</p>

    <p>I am having two oak frames made for my <art id=0444>new peasant's head</art>
    and for my Poet study. Oh, my dear boy, sometimes I know so
    well what I want. <label content="health.general">I can very well do without God both in my
    life and in my painting, but I cannot, ill as I am, do without
    something which is greater than I, which is my life - the power
    to create.</label></p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">And if, defrauded of the power to create physically, a man
    tries to create thoughts in place of children, he is still very
    much part of humanity.</p>

    <p>And in a picture I want to say something comforting as music
    is comforting. I want to paint men and women with that
    something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize, and
    which we seek to confer by the actual radiance and vibration of
    our colourings.</label></p>

    <p>Portraiture so understood does not become like an Ary
    Scheffer, just because there is a blue sky behind as in the
    &ldquo;St. Augustine.&rdquo; For Ary Scheffer is so little of a
    colourist.</p>

    <p>But it would be more in harmony with what Eug. Delacroix
    attempted and brought off in his &ldquo;Tasso in Prison,&rdquo;
    and many other pictures, representing a <i>real</i> man. Ah!
    portraiture, portraiture with the thought, the soul of the
    model in it, that is what I think must come.</p>

    <p>The Belgian and I talked a lot yesterday about the
    advantages and disadvantages of this place. We quite agree
    regarding both. And on the great advantage it would be to us if
    we could <i>move</i> now North, now South.</p>

    <p>He is going to stay with McKnight again so as to live more
    cheaply. That, however, has I think one disadvantage, because
    living with a slacker makes one slack.</p>

    <p>I think you would enjoy meeting him, he is still young. I
    think he will ask your advice about buying Japanese prints and
    Daumier lithographs. As to these - the Daumiers - it would be
    well to get some more of them, because later there will be none
    to be got.</p>

    <p>The Belgian was saying that he paid 80 francs for board and
    lodging with McKnight. So what a difference there is in living
    together, since I have to pay 45 a month for nothing but
    lodging. And so I always come back to the same reckoning, that
    with Gauguin I should not spend more than I do alone, and be no
    worse off. But we must consider that they were very badly
    housed, not for sleeping, but for the possibility of work at
    home.</p>

    <p>So I am always between two currents of thought, first the
    material difficulties, turning round and round to make a
    living; and second, the study of colour. I am always in hope of
    making a discovery there, to express the love of two lovers by
    a marriage of two complementary colours, their mingling and
    their opposition, the mysterious vibrations of kindred tones.
    To express the thought of a brow by the radiance of a light
    tone against a sombre background.</p>

    <p>To express hope by some star, the eagerness of a soul by a
    sunset radiance. Certainly there is nothing in that of trompe
    d'oeil realism, but isn't it something that actually
    exists?</p>

    <p>Good-by for the present. I will tell you another time when
    the Belgian may be leaving,, because I shall see him again
    tomorrow.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>The Belgian says that his people at home have a de Groux,
    the study for the &ldquo;Benedicit&eacute;&rdquo; in the
    Brussels Museum.</p>

    <p>The portrait of the Belgian is something like <art id=0343>the portrait
    of Reid</art> which you have, in execution.</p>
