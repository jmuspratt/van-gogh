  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>When I read your letter this morning, I was greatly touched
    by what you wrote. <sup>1</sup> This is one of those things of
    which the world sometimes says, &ldquo;Why should he meddle
    with it?&rdquo; And yet it is not so much our own will as
    circumstances which drive us to do it. And once we understand
    the situation, such a deep, fathomless pity is roused in us
    that we can no longer hesitate. And this is the case with you,
    I think&hellip;what else can I say? but that it seems to me
    that in such cases we must follow our impulses.</p>

    <p>Victor Hugo says: &ldquo;Par-dessus la raison il y a la
    conscience.&rdquo; [Above the intellect there is conscience];
    there are things which we feel to be good and true, though many
    things remain incomprehensible and dark in the cold light of
    reason and calculation. And though the society in which we live
    considers such actions thoughtless, or reckless, or foolish, or
    I don't know what else - what can we say once the hidden forces
    of sympathy and love have been aroused in us? And though it may
    be that we cannot argue against the reasoning which society
    usually employs, against those who allow themselves to be led
    by sentiment and to act from impulse - arguing is not the
    principal thing, and he who has kept his faith in God sometimes
    hears the soft voice of conscience; then one does well to
    follow it with the na&iuml;vet&eacute; of a child, without
    saying more about it to others than can be helped.</p>

    <p>If one has such an encounter, one must expect it to cause a
    struggle, especially a struggle with oneself, because sometimes
    one literally does not know what to do or what not to do. But
    isn't this struggle - and even the mistakes one may make -
    better, and doesn't it develop us more than if we
    systematically avoid emotions? The latter thing is, in my
    opinion, what makes many so-called strong spirits into nothing
    but weaklings in reality.</p>

    <p>You have my full sympathy in this matter, and as I myself am
    standing in the midst of realities and can tell you my
    experience since we spoke about it last, if you wish to hear
    something about it, or wish to speak about the future, or
    consult about whatever it may be, I am always entirely at your
    disposal.</p>

    <p>And your writing that you will come to Holland before long
    is very welcome news indeed.</p>

    <p>Perseverance is the great thing in love, once it has taken
    hold of us. That is, if the love is returned, for if it is
    decidedly not returned, one is literally absolutely
    helpless.</p>

    <p>Well, I thank you for your confidence, and when I think it
    over, I am relatively confident of the result. Such a feeling
    is not &ldquo;passion,&rdquo; for a deep, fathomless pity is at
    the root of it. Nor do I believe that such a thing makes you
    unfit for thinking about other things; on the contrary, it has
    a serious character which rouses and strengthens all your
    faculties and augments rather than diminishes your energy.</p>

    <p>So after this you will not object to my saying a few more
    things about the drawings. I am very glad you think the old
    man's head typical - the <i>model</i> is really <i>typical</i>,
    I assure you. I did some more of him.<label content="art.technique"> Today I drew one with
    lithographic crayon. Then I threw a pail of water on the
    drawing, and in that moistness I began to model with pencil. If
    it succeeds, one gets very delicate tones; but it is a
    dangerous method, which may turn out badly. But if it succeeds,
    the result is quite &ldquo;non &eacute;barb&eacute;&rdquo; -
    delicate tones of black which most resemble an etching. I also
    did a woman's head this way, standing out against the light, so
    the whole is in tone, with highlights on the profile, etc.</label></p>

    <p><i>Did you receive the second roll with five heads</i> sent
    from here, I think, on the fifth or sixth of January? It was
    the third roll mailed to you.</p>

    <p>When you have looked at them for some time, I think you will
    find the same thing in them as in the first two, for there
    <i>must be</i> something of nature in them, as I literally
    wrested them from nature and worked after the model from
    beginning to end. I am very anxious to show you the studies -
    not because I am satisfied with my own work, but because,
    though I am not satisfied with it, I see that it is
    progressing, and that something is developing in it which will
    have some character.</p>

    <p>When I came here to this town, what struck me most was, for
    instance, the Geest and those neighbourhoods. And slowly it is
    taking shape - but - what a struggle to bring such a thing to
    an end.</p>

    <p>Today I saw photos of drawings by Barnard, figures from
    Dickens; at the time I saw the original drawings in London.
    There is a force in them as in Nicolaes Maes, for instance, but
    quite a modern sentiment and conception. Such things warm my
    heart so much, and are so cheering, because I think of the
    models here, how they would look if they were drawn in that
    way, and then of course I say to myself, &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo;
    Work on till we have quite mastered the Black and White. There
    is a similarity between art and love, it is like swinging
    between &ldquo;je l'ai depuis longtemps&rdquo; and &ldquo;je ne
    l'aurais jamais&rdquo; [I have had it for a long time,
    <i>and</i> I shall never have it], as Michelet expresses it,
    and one passes from melancholy to animation and enthusiasm; and
    this will always remain so - only the oscillations become
    stronger. Victor Hugo speaks of &ldquo;comme un phare &agrave;
    &eacute;clipse&rdquo; [like an occluding light], and that's
    also a good comparison.</p>

    <p>If you have received my letter of the fifth or sixth of
    January, with the second roll of drawings, you will remember
    that then I was already quite out of cash. Now today I had to
    pay the rent and the three models whom I hadn't been able to
    pay before, and I also absolutely needed various drawing
    materials. I am working very hard at present, and I must not
    stop, but really the models eat me out of house and home.</p>

    <p>Well, it would certainly be good if I could have something
    extra - would it be possible? I hesitate to ask it because of
    what you just wrote me about yourself, and I understand
    perfectly that it brings you cares, which I respect and with
    which I sympathize. But the thing with me is that I got
    somewhat in arrears by working so hard, and when I receive the
    money, I at once have to pay out more than half of it. I
    <i>cannot</i> live more economically than we do, I have
    economized wherever possible; but the work is developing,
    especially these last weeks, and I can hardly control it any
    longer - that is, the expenses it causes. Would it be possible
    for you to send me a little more? I think you will understand
    it when you see the studies. Well, forgive me for mentioning
    it, but I cannot do otherwise, I am in arrears for the daily
    expenses, and that is why I am absolutely penniless before the
    tenth day.</p>

    <p>At all events, write me soon, and be assured of my full
    sympathy in regard to what you wrote me. Adieu, boy. A
    handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
