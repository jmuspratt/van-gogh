  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Bravo on going to Etten May 21, so happily four of the six
    children were at home. Father wrote to me at length how
    everything went on the day. Thanks also for your last
    letter.</p>

    <p>Did I write to you about the storm I watched recently? The
    sea was yellowish, especially close to the shore. On the
    horizon a streak of light, and above it immensely large dark
    grey clouds, from which one could see the rain coming down in
    slanting streaks. The wind blew the dust from the little white
    path among the rocks into the sea and shook the hawthorn bushes
    in bloom and the wallflowers that grow on the rocks. To the
    right, fields of young green corn, and in the distance the
    town, which, with its towers, mills, slate roofs, Gothic-style
    houses and the harbor below, between two jetties sticking out
    into the sea, looked like the towns Albrecht D&uuml;rer used to
    etch.</p>

    <p>I watched the sea last Sunday night as well. Everything was
    dark grey, but on the horizon the day was beginning to break.
    It was still very early and yet a skylark was already singing.
    And the nightingales in the gardens by the sea. In the
    distance, the light from the lighthouse, the guard ship,
    etc.</p>

    <p>That same night I looked out of the window of my room at the
    roofs of the houses you can see from there, and at the tops of
    the elms, dark against the night sky. Above the roofs, a single
    star, but a beautiful, big, friendly one.<label content="feelings.loneliness"> And I thought of us
    all and I thought of my own years gone by and of our home, and
    these words and this sentiment sprang to my mind, `Keep me from
    being a son who brings shame, give me Thy blessing, not because
    I deserve it, but for my Mother's sake. Thou art Love, cover
    all things. Without Thy constant blessing we succeed in
    nothing.'</label></p>

    <p>Enclosed is a little drawing of the view from the school
    window through which the boys follow their parents with their
    eyes as they go back to the station after a visit. Many a one
    will never forget the view from that window.</p>

    <p>You really ought to have seen it this week, when we had days
    of rain, especially at dusk when the lamps are lit and their
    light is reflected in the wet streets. On such days Mr. Stokes
    can sometimes be in a bad temper, and if the boys make more of
    a noise than he likes they occasionally have to go without
    their bread and tea in the evening. You ought to see them
    looking out of the window then, there is something so
    melancholy about it. They have so little apart from their meals
    to look forward to and to see them through from one day to the
    next.</p>

    <p>I wish you could also see them going down the dark stairs
    and through the narrow passage to where they have their dinner.
    The sun does shine pleasantly in there. Another peculiar place
    is a room with a rotten floor where there are six basins in
    which they wash, and a dim light is all that reaches the
    washstand through the broken panes of the window It is
    certainly quite a melancholy sight. I should like to spend, or
    to have spent, a winter with them, just to see what it is
    like.</p>

    <p>The youngsters have made an oil stain on your little
    drawing, please forgive them.</p>

    <p>Enclosed, a few lines for Uncle Jan. And now, good night.
    Should anyone ask after me, my greetings to them. Do you still
    visit Borchers from time to time? If you see him, remember me
    to him as well as to Willem Valkis and everybody at the
    Rooses'. A handshake in my thoughts from</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
