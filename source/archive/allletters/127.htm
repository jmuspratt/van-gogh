  <body>
    <p>Borinage, Hainaut</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is time I wrote to you again, to wish you, firstly, all
    the best at the start of the New Year. May many good things be
    your lot and may God's blessing rest on your work in the year
    on which we are now embarking.</p>

    <p>I very much long for a letter from you, to hear how things
    are going and how you are, and also if you have <i>seen
    anything beautiful and remarkable of late</i>. As far as I am
    concerned, you'll be aware that there are no paintings here in
    the Borinage, that by and large they do not even know what a
    painting is, so obviously I have not seen anything in the way
    of art since my departure from Brussels. But that does not
    alter the fact that the country here is very special and very
    picturesque, everything <i>speaks,</i> as it were, and is full
    of character. Lately, during the dark days before Christmas,
    snow was lying on the ground. Everything reminded one then of
    the medieval paintings by, say, Peasant Brueghel, and by so
    many others who have known how to depict the singular effect of
    red and green, black and white so strikingly. And often the
    sights here have made me think of the work of, for example,
    Thijs Mans or Albrecht D&uuml;rer. There are sunken roads here,
    overgrown with thornbushes and gnarled old trees with their
    freakish roots, which resemble perfectly that road on
    D&uuml;rer's etching, &ldquo;Death and the Knight.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Thus, a few days ago, the miners returning home in the
    evening towards dusk in the white snow were a singular sight.
    These people are quite black when they emerge into the daylight
    from the dark mines, looking jut like chimney sweeps. Their
    dwellings are usually small and should really be called huts;
    they lie scattered along the sunken roads, in the woods and on
    the slopes of the hills. Here and there one can still see
    moss-covered roofs, and in the evening a friendly light shines
    through the small-paned windows.</p>

    <p>Much as we have coppices and shrubby oaks in Brabant and
    pollard willows in Holland, so one sees blackthorn hedges
    around the gardens, fields and meadows here. Lately, with the
    snow, the effect is that of black lettering on white paper,
    like pages of the Gospel.</p>

    <p>I have already spoken several times here, both in a fairly
    large room especially designed for religious meetings and also
    at the meetings they usually hold in the evenings in the
    workmen's cottages, and which may best be called Bible classes.
    Among other things, I have spoken on the parable of the mustard
    seed, the barren fig tree and the man born blind. On Christmas,
    of course, on the stable in Bethlehem and Peace on earth. If,
    with God's blessing, I were to get a permanent position here, I
    should welcome that with all my heart.</p>

    <p>Everywhere round here one sees the large chimneys and the
    tremendous mountains of coal at the entrance to the mines, the
    so-called charbonnages. You know that large drawing by Bosboom,
    &ldquo;Chaudfontaine&rdquo; - it gives a good impression of the
    countryside in these parts, except that here everything is coal
    while to the north of Hainaut there are stone quarries and in
    Chaudfontaine they have iron.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">I still keep thinking of the day you came to Brussels and of
    our visit to the Museum. And I often wish you were a bit nearer
    and we could be together more often.</label> Do reply soon, I keep
    looking at that etching of &ldquo;A Young Citizen&rdquo; over
    and over again.</p>

    <p>The miner's talk is not very easy to make out, but they
    understand ordinary French well, provided it is spoken quickly
    and fluently enough, for then it automatically sounds like
    their patois, which comes out with amazing speed. At a meeting
    this week, my text was Acts 16 9, &ldquo;And a vision appeared
    to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and
    prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help
    us.&rdquo; And they listened attentively when I tried to
    describe what the Macedonian was like who needed and longed for
    the comfort of the Gospel and for knowledge of the Only True
    God. That we should think of him as a workman, with lines of
    sorrow and suffering and fatigue on his countenance, without
    pomp or glory but with an immortal soul and needing the food
    that does not perish, namely God's word, because man liveth not
    by bread alone, but by all the words that flow from God's
    mouth. How Jesus Christ is the Master who can strengthen and
    comfort and enlighten one like the Macedonian, a workman and
    labourer whose life is hard. Because He Himself is the great
    Man of Sorrows who knows our ills, Who was called the son of a
    carpenter, though He was the Son of God and the great Healer of
    sick souls. Who laboured for thirty years in a humble
    carpenter's shop to fulfill God's will. And God wills that in
    imitation of Christ, man should live and walk humbly on earth,
    not reaching for the sky, but bowing to humble things, learning
    from the Gospel to be meek and humble of heart.</p>

    <p>I have already had occasion to visit some of the sick, since
    there are so many of them here. Wrote today to the President of
    the Committee of Evangelization asking him if my case could be
    dealt with at the next meeting of the committee.</p>

    <p>It is thawing tonight. I can't tell you how picturesque the
    hilly country looks in the thaw, with the snow melting and now
    that the black fields with the green of the winter wheat can be
    seen again.</p>

    <p>For a stranger, the villages here are real rabbit warrens
    with the countless narrow streets and alleyways of small
    worker's houses, at the foot of the hills as well as on the
    slopes and the top. The nearest comparison is a village like
    Scheveningen, especially the back streets, or villages in
    Brittany as we know them from pictures. But you have travelled
    through these parts by train on your way to Paris and may have
    fleeting memories of them. The Protestant churches are small,
    like the one at De Hoeve though a little larger, but the place
    where I spoke was just a large bare room which could hold a
    hundred people at most. I also attended a religious service in
    a stable or shed, so everything it is simple and original
    enough.</p>

    <p>Write soon if you can find the time, and know that you are
    again and again, indeed constantly, in my thoughts. Wishing
    once more that God's blessing be yours in the New Year, and
    shaking your hand in my thoughts, believe me, always,</p>

    <p>Your very loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>My regards to everyone at the Roos's, and wish them all the
    very best for the New Year, as well as anyone who may ask after
    me.</p>

    <p>When you write, please address your letter care of M. van
    der Haegen, Colporteur, &agrave; P&acirc;turages, pr&egrave;s
    de Mons, Borinage, Hainaut.</p>

    <p>I have just visited a little old woman in a
    charcoal-burner's home. She is terribly ill, but full of faith
    and patience. I read a chapter with her and prayed with them
    all. The people here have something unique and attractive about
    them thanks to their simplicity and good nature, not unlike the
    Brabant people in Zundert and Etten.</p>
