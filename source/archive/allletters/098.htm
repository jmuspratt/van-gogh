  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter that arrived today, I am very busy
    and write in a hurry. I gave your letter to Uncle Jan, he sends
    you his greetings and thanks for it.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">There was a sentence in your letter that struck me, &ldquo;I
    wish I were far away from everything, I am the cause of all,
    and bring only sorrow to everybody, I alone have brought all
    this misery on myself and others.&rdquo; These words struck me
    because that same feeling, just the same, not more nor less, is
    also on my conscience.</label></p>

    <p>When I think of the past, - when I think of the future of
    almost invincible difficulties, of much and difficult work,
    which I do not like, which I, or rather my evil self, would
    like to shirk; when I think the eyes of so many are fixed on
    me, - who will know where the fault is, if I do not succeed,
    who will not make me trivial reproaches, but as they are well
    tried and trained in everything that is right and virtuous and
    fine gold, they will say, as it were by the expression of their
    faces: we have helped you and have been a light unto you, - we
    have done for you what we could, have you tried honestly? what
    is now our reward and the fruit of our labour? See! when I
    think of all this, and of so many other things like it, too
    numerous to name them all, of all the difficulties and cares
    that do not grow less when we advance in life, of sorrow, of
    disappointment, of the fear of failure, of disgrace, - then I
    also have the longing - I wish I were far away from
    everything!</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">And yet I go on, but prudently and hoping to have strength
    to resist those things, so that I shall know what to answer to
    those reproaches that threaten me, and believing that
    notwithstanding everything that seems against me, I yet shall
    reach the aim I am striving for, and if God wills it, shall
    find favour in the eyes of some I love and in the eyes of those
    that will come after me.</label></p>

    <p>There is written: &ldquo;Lift up the hands which hang down,
    and the feeble knees,&rdquo; and when the disciples had worked
    all night and had not caught any fish, they were told &ldquo;go
    out into the deep and cast your nets again into the
    sea.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label subject="health.fatigue">My head is sometimes heavy and often it burns and my
    thoughts are confused</label> - I don't see how I shall ever get that
    difficult and extensive study into it - to get used to and
    persevere in simple regular study after all those emotional
    years is not always easy. And yet I go on; if we are tired
    isn't it then because we have already walked a long way, and if
    it is true that man has his battle to fight on earth, is not
    then the feeling of weariness and the burning of the head a
    sign that we have been struggling? When we are working at a
    difficult task and strive after a good thing we fight a
    righteous battle, the direct reward of which is that we are
    kept from much evil.</p>

    <p>And God sees the trouble and the sorrow and He can help in
    spite of all. The faith in God is firm in me - it is no
    imagination, no idle faith - but it is so, it is true, there is
    a God Who is alive and He is with our parents and <i>His eye is
    also upon us</i>, and I am sure He plans our life and we do not
    quite belong to ourselves as it were - and this God is no other
    than Christ of Whom we read in our Bible and Whose word and
    history is also deep in our heart. If I had only given all my
    strength to it before, yes, I should have been further now, -
    but even now He will be a strong support, and it is in His
    power to make our lives bearable, to keep us from evil, to let
    all things contribute towards a good end, to make our end
    peaceful.</p>

    <p>There is much evil in the world and in ourselves, terrible
    things, and one does not need to be far advanced in life, to be
    in fear of much and to feel the need of a firm faith in life
    hereafter, and to know that without faith in God one cannot
    live, one cannot bear it. But with that faith one can go on for
    a long time.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.death">When I found myself in front of the corpse of Aerssen the
    calmness and dignity and solemn silence of death contrasted
    with us, who still live, to such an extent, that we all felt
    the truth Of what his daughter said with such simplicity:
    &ldquo;he is freed from the burden of life, which we have to go
    on bearing.&rdquo; And yet we are so much attached to the old
    life, because next to our despondent moods we have our happy
    moments when heart and soul rejoice, like the lark that cannot
    keep from singing in the morning, even though the soul
    sometimes sinks within us and is fearful. And the memories of
    all we have loved stay and come back to us in the evening of
    our life. They are not dead but sleep, and it is well to gather
    a treasure of them.</label></p>

    <p>A handshake and write soon to</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
