  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter; I am also fond of &ldquo;Tell me the
    old, old story.&rdquo; I heard it sung for the first time one
    evening in Paris, in a little church where I often went. Number
    12 is also very beautiful. I am sorry indeed that I did not
    hear Moody and Sankey when they were in London.</p>

    <p>There is such a longing for religion among the people in the
    large cities. Many a worker in a factory or shop has had a
    strange, beautiful and pious youth. But city life sometimes
    removes &ldquo;<i>the early dew of morning.</i>&rdquo; Even so,
    the longing for &ldquo;<i>the old, old story</i>&rdquo;
    remains. What is at the bottom of the heart stays at the bottom
    of the heart. In one of his [sic] books Elliot [George Eliot] describes the
    life of factory workers, etc., who have formed a little
    community and hold religious services in a chapel in Lantern
    Yard, and he says of it, &ldquo;It is the kingdom of God on
    earth, no more and no less.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It is touching to see the thousands of people listening to
    the evangelists.</p>

    <p>Your plan of giving Father and Mother &ldquo;The
    Farewell&rdquo; by Sad&eacute;e is good, so that is settled.
    Willemien will be there on May 21.<label content="attitude.family"> From your letter I see you
    also intend to go. By all means do so, boy, if it is possible.
    There is sometimes a special blessing in such an act. What a
    surprise it would be for them! Mother's last letter had a
    melancholy tone; in a word or two she touched upon the
    necessity of our being so far from home, and her eyes too are
    giving her trouble. Come, boy, brighten them once more by your
    presence on that day.</label></p>

    <p>This afternoon Mr. Reid sent me a catalogue of the
    exhibition in London. A firm handshake and congratulations on
    the birthdays of Lies and Cor and also on May 21. Kind regards
    to Roos, in haste,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
