  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many warm thanks for your letter; the enclosure was very
    welcome, it helps me a great deal. <label content="Theo.mistress">I begin by telling you that
    it takes a load off my mind to know that the past of the woman
    whom you write about is quite different from what I first
    supposed. Namely that she has known other things beside poverty
    and narrow-mindedness, so that I suppose she can fully
    appreciate you with regard to culture and broad-mindedness too,
    more than a woman who has been crushed by misery from childhood
    on and knows no better. From what you say about her reading,
    for instance, I see she has a sentiment which many other women
    completely lack.</p>

    <p>Social standing and her experience contribute to the
    formation of her character, and, I think, make her entirely
    suitable for you. Certainly you will be doubly, doubly happy
    when she recovers. And I wish from the bottom of my heart that
    she might become your wife, for a woman turns life into
    something so very different.</label></p>

    <p>And what is a woman like her without a man to appreciate and
    understand her? Something pathetic, yes, you termed it
    correctly, something like a spirit or a shadow. Look, I am
    afraid she would return to such a state (even if her
    circumstances and her health were different) if you left
    her.</p>

    <p>And in my opinion an infinite and profound happiness - for
    you as well as for her - would be within reach because of the
    consciousness of not being alone any more. For it is sometimes
    bitterly hard for us men, too, that being alone.</p>

    <p>But Isra&euml;l's poetry without there being anybody to
    understand it - that is something so awful that it is beyond
    one's comprehension, and one cannot keep hold of the idea.</p>

    <p>Only this being alone and wandering &hellip; How deep
    Michelet's saying is, &ldquo;Pourquoi y a-t-il une femme seule
    sur la terre?&rdquo; [Why is there a lone woman on earth?]</p>

    <p>You once said, or rather wrote, &ldquo;Earnestness is better
    than the most delicate raillery.&rdquo; It is the same thing
    here, <i>mustn't</i> one take such a figure seriously? I mean,
    the life of us men is so dependent on our relations with women
    - and, of course, the opposite is also true - that it seems to
    me one must never laugh at women or think lightly of them. If
    one reads carefully, Balzac's Petites mis&egrave;res de la vie
    conjugale is very, very serious and honestly well meant - not
    intended to separate but to unite; but not everybody sees that
    in it.</p>

    <p>When I read your letter, what struck me immediately was that
    you are involved with a person who, for instance, would be able
    to evoke the past along with you, who will learn to see the
    same things in art that you see, and this is of great
    value.</p>

    <p>I congratulate you, my dear fellow, because by your
    description, she is a woman to whom one may apply Michelet's
    words, &ldquo;Une dame c'est une dame.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I think you will also find her in Ary Scheffer's work.</p>

    <p>As to reading, I think the works of Michelet would be
    something to soothe and strengthen her mind.</p>

    <p>Just like Victor Hugo.</p>

    <p>And what Michelet himself thought desirable reading for a
    woman is Imitation of Christ by Thomas a Kempis - of course the
    origional edition, not the one that has been garbled and
    spoiled by the clergy.</p>

    <p>But I suppose you know more about French literature than
    I.</p>

    <p>That book by Thomas a Kempis is as beautiful as, for
    instance, Ary Scheffer's &ldquo;[Christus] Consolator&rdquo; -
    it can be compared to nothing else. But I have seen editions
    that were purposely changed and distorted by adding to each
    chapter a kind of explanation which was terrible. I once bought
    one like that; it was a very bad bargain indeed.</p>

    <p>And do you know what seems excellent to me? - that a patient
    should breathe fresh air from a book. What I mean is La Nature
    chez elle [Nature at home] by Bodmer, with text by
    Th&eacute;ophile Gautier - the old series for sale at
    L'Illustration or Monde Illustr&eacute;. But I recently saw a
    Nature chez elle which was much thinner and less fresh than the
    first series, nor do I think the text was by Th&eacute;ophile
    Gautier. Probably done by Bodmer at a later period, when he had
    lost some of his early vigour.</p>

    <p>Boy, I have been drawing with such delight - fishermen's
    heads with that sou'wester I told you about; the fish scales
    were still sticking to it when I got it.</p>

    <p>What a feeling you must have had when you walked into the
    hospital or clinic to visit her the day after the operation!
    Isn't that one of the things one can hardly talk about, the
    emotion being so intense? At least, when you wrote me about
    that operation, I was reminded of visiting the woman on the day
    of her confinement last summer.</p>

    <p>Recently you wrote about a certain Laurens who generally
    makes large drawings or pictures. I didn't know him then (only
    as a painter of Oriental landscapes), but today I saw an
    etching by Courtry after a picture by Jean Paul Laurens, a
    scene from the Revolution, and I liked it very much, especially
    some types and heads.</p>

    <p>But it is quite possible that his pictures are not so good
    as the etching.</p>

    <p>Is Jules Goupil's work still good? One is inclined to ask
    that question when one sees men like &Eacute;mile Wauters and
    Hoeterinks, for instance, lose their strong grip on reality,
    replacing it with things which are correct, yes, and have a
    delicate sentiment, too, but which do not reach the vigour of
    their earlier work and instead betray a certain timidity.</p>

    <p>And it is sad when it's that way.</p>

    <p>So few manage to remain vigorous like Isra&euml;ls, for
    instance.</p>

    <p>Recently I saw a new edition of R. Caldecott's picture books
    and bought two of them, namely, illustrations of Washington
    Irving's Sketch Book, which both together cost a shilling now.
    There is a description of Christmas in a little village at the
    beginning of this century. Those small drawings are pithy, like
    Jacque's, for instance, or Menzel's. When you come, you must
    look at the wood engravings again. Right now there are some
    people like Caldecott, for instance, who are quite original and
    highly interesting. How I wish we could be together more, and
    on an evening or a Sunday, look over those things which many
    others pass by.</p>

    <p>I am reading Eliot's Middlemarch. Eliot analyzes like Balzac
    or Zola - but English situations, with an English
    sentiment.</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, may everything go well, and once more, best
    wishes.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
