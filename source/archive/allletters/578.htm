  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your kind letter and for the 50-fr. note
    which it contained. Are you tolerably well, and is the weather
    in Paris bearable?</p>

    <p>We have days of sun and wind here. I walk a lot to get fresh
    air. So far I am sleeping and eating at the hospital. Yesterday
    and today I began to work. When Mme. Roulin also left to go and
    live temporarily with her mother in the country, she took
    &ldquo;La Berceuse&rdquo; with her. I had <art id=0504>the study of it</art> and
    <art id=0508>two repetitions</art>. She had a good eye and<art id=0505> took the best</art>, only I
    am <art id=0507>doing it again at the moment</art> and I do not
    want it to be inferior.</p>

    <p>In reply to Mourier's letter, which gave me pleasure, if
    Gauguin wants to make an exchange with you for a copy of
    &ldquo;La Berceuse,&rdquo; he can send it to his wife in
    Denmark, and I should willingly see a canvas of mine going
    there in this way. But as I have told you already, this canvas
    may be unintelligible.</p>

    <p>I should have liked to send something to Holland, but I
    haven't enough confidence for that yet.</p>

    <p>Can you see a blade of grass from your new apartment? I hope
    so.</p>

    <p>As for Koning, really I daren't encourage him to come here
    too much, even with his inclination to go wild about the Midi,
    after the experience I have had of it now.</p>

    <p>If he goes to Nice or Mentone, where it is perhaps
    healthier, he is sure to be taken by the gambling crowd because
    of his good nature, etc., for it is a real plague, that, even
    here already, and it warps the character.</p>

    <p>But if one has <i>too</i> many troubles, what is one to do
    or say?</p>

    <p>In short, you see that I do not yet quite know what to
    think.</p>

    <p>Bernard also wrote to me. I have not yet been able to
    answer, for it is so hard to explain the character of the
    difficulties one may meet with here, and with our habits and
    ways of thinking in the North or in Paris, it is fatal to stay
    here long. In this part of the world you have to endure things
    that are no joke.</p>

    <p>It must be admitted, however, that in every town there is a
    school of drawing and a set of collectors, but you realize
    that, directed as they are by some invalids and idiots of the
    Beaux-Arts, it is only make-believe and sham.</p>

    <p>M. Salles handed the 50 francs over at once. I am very glad
    that Gauguin has finished some lithographs.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I agree with what you say, that if it takes a more serious
    turn someday, I must do what the doctors say and not oppose it.
    But that may be neither tomorrow nor the next day.</label></p>

    <p>Now it is not uncommon, it seems, to see even a whole
    population in these parts seized with panic, as at Nice during
    the earthquake. Just now the whole town is uneasy, no one
    rightly knowing why, and I saw in the papers that actually
    there have again been slight earthquake shocks in places not
    far from here. The more reason then, I consider, why as far as
    I am concerned I should wait with as much patience as I can
    muster, hoping that things will clear up again. At another
    time, if I were less impressionable, I should probably poke a
    good deal of fun at what seems to me topsy-turvy and off-beat
    in the ways of this country. At present it doesn't make a
    particularly funny impression on me.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">Well, well, after all there are so many painters who are
    cracked in one way or another that little by little I shall be
    reconciled to it.</p>

    <p>I understand what Gauguin must suffer more than ever, for in
    the tropics he caught the very same thing, this excessive
    sensitivity. In the hospital I actually saw a mad Negress, who
    is staying there and working as a servant. Tell him that.</label></p>

    <p>If you told Rivet that you are so uneasy about me, he would
    certainly reassure you by telling you that because there is so
    much sympathy and community of ideas between us, you feel
    rather the same way. Do not think too much about me, as if it
    were an obsession. Besides, I shall get along better if I know
    you have peace of mind.</p>

    <p>A good handshake. You are very kind to say I could come to
    Paris, but I think the excitement of a big town would never do
    for me. Good-by for now.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
