  <body>
    <p>Monsieur,</p>

    <p>Your poor brother has been taken into the hospital again. As you will undoubtedly have
    heard from him, he had returned to his house a few days ago.</p>

    <p>However, his behaviour, and the way
    he talked, made me fear that the improvement which had taken
    place was only apparent. This fear which we all had, proved
    only too well-founded. A petition signed by some 30 neighbours, informed M. the Mayor of the
    inconvenience caused
    by allowing this man his complete liberty and mentions facts to
    support this assertion. The superintendent of police, to whom
    the document was submitted, has immediately had your brother
    taken back to the hospital with the express order not to let him
    leave. He came to my house to inform me of the situation, and to ask me to write
    to you.</p>

    <p>It is clear that a decision has to be made. Is it your
    intention to come and take your brother with you, or to put him
    yourself into an institution of your own choice? Or do you
    prefer to leave it in the hands of the police? On this point we
    should have a categorical reply.</p>

    <p>Will you without hesitation make your intentions known, and adress them either to myself or
    to the Mayor or to the superintendent of police. We will only act after having received
    your reply and we will act according to your wishes.</p>

    <p>I had rather hoped to have some better news, and that stopped me from writing to you sooner
    to acknowledge receipt of your letter and the 50 f. that it contained. This sum I have had taken
    to my home by the cleaning woman.</p>

    <p>My deepest sympathies, and I assure you of my best wishes. Salles.</p>
  </body>
