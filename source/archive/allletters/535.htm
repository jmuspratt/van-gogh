    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>If Gauguin were working with me and if for his part he were
    fairly generous with pictures, doesn't it mean that you would
    be giving work to two artists who could do nothing without you?
    And while admitting that I think you are perfectly justified in
    saying that as far as money is concerned, you see no advantage
    in it, yet on the other hand you would be doing the same sort
    of thing as Durand Ruel, who bought pictures from Claude Monet
    in the days before anybody else had recognized his
    individuality. And Durand Ruel made nothing on it; at one time
    he was overloaded with the pictures and could not pass them on,
    but still, what he did remains well done, and now he can always
    say that he carried the day. If, however, I saw it would mean
    losing money, I wouldn't suggest it. But Gauguin must be loyal,
    and now that I see that his friend Laval's arrival has
    temporarily opened a new resource to him, I think that he is
    hesitating between Laval and us.</p>

    <p>I don't blame him; but if Gauguin does not lose sight of his
    own interest, it is only fair that you should not lose sight of
    yours, from the point of view of repayment in pictures. Already
    we can see that Gauguin would already have left us completely
    in the lurch if Laval had had ever so little money. I am very
    curious to know what he will say to you in his next letter,
    which you will certainly get soon.</p>

    <p>Well, I am sure that our friendship with him will endure
    whether he comes or not, but also that we on our part must show
    some firmness. He will not find anything better, unless indeed
    it were by taking advantage of what you have tried to do for
    him. But that he will not dare do. Only you must understand
    that if I see that he isn't coming, I shall not be the least
    upset, and I shall not work the less for it; if he comes, he
    will be very welcome, but I see clearly that counting on him
    would be just the thing to do us in. Faithful he will be if it
    is to his advantage; if he does not come, he will find
    something else, but he will find nothing better, and he would
    lose nothing by not letting us down.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">I'll need another 5 meters of ordinary canvas at 2.50 fr.,
    but of course when Tasset is figuring the weight of the parcel,
    he should send a meter more or a meter less so as not to double
    the carriage.</label></p>

    <p>I think now is a good opportunity for you to ask Gauguin
    bluntly when he writes to you, &ldquo;Are you coming or not? If
    you have not made up your mind one way or the other, we shall
    not feel bound to carry out the scheme.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If the plan of a more serious combination cannot be carried
    out, all right, but then each should regain his freedom of
    action. I have sent off my letter to Gauguin; I asked them for
    an exchange. If they are willing, I would very much like to
    have here the portrait of Bernard by Gauguin and that of
    Gauguin by Bernard.</p>

    <p>I enclose an article which will interest you. You would be
    very wise to go and see this.</p>

    <p>Ideas for my work are coming to me in swarms, so that though
    I'm alone, I have no time to think or to feel, I go on painting
    like a steam engine. I think there will hardly ever be a
    standstill again. And my view is that you will never find a
    live studio ready-made, but that it is created from day to day
    by patient work and going on and on in one place.</p>

    <p>I have <art id=0550>a study of an old mill</art> painted in
    broken tones like <art id=0466>the oak tree on the rock</art>,
    that study you were saying you had had framed along with <art id=0422>the
    &ldquo;Sower.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>The idea of the &ldquo;Sower" continues to haunt me all the
    time. Exaggerated studies like the &ldquo;Sower&rdquo; and like
    this<art id=0463> &ldquo;Night Caf&eacute;&rdquo;</art> usually seem to me
    atrociously ugly and bad, but when I am moved by something, as
    now by this little article on Dostoievsky, then these are the
    only ones which appear to have any deep meaning. I have a third
    study now, of a landscape with a factory, and a huge sun in a
    red sky above red roofs, a day with a wicked mistral when
    nature seems to be in a fury.[Painting lost]</p>

    <p>As for the house, the thought that it's going to be
    habitable continues to soothe me. Will my work really be worse
    because, by staying in the same place, I shall see the seasons
    pass and re-pass over the same subjects, seeing again the same
    orchards in the spring, the same fields of wheat in summer?
    Involuntarily I shall see my work cut out for me beforehand,
    and I shall be better able to make plans. Then if I keep some
    studies here to make a coherent whole, it will mean work of a
    deeper calm at the end of a certain time.</p>

    <p>I feel that as far as that goes, we have done pretty much
    the right thing. Only I wish you were living nearer. Seeing
    that I cannot bring the North nearer the South, what's to be
    done? Then I tell myself that by myself I am not able to do
    sufficiently important painting to justify your coming South
    two or three times a year. But if Gauguin came and if it was
    fairly well known that we were staying here and helping artists
    live and work, I still do not see at all why the South should
    not become another native land to you as well as to me.</p>

    <p>I am very glad to have finished my letter to Gauguin without
    having said that his wavering between staying with Laval or
    with me has left me rather at sea. It would be unfair not to
    leave him perfectly free to choose and to do the best he can.
    But I did write that I was convinced that even if he did not
    come here because of the journey's being impossible, he should
    not stay in a hotel any longer. And that this would then mean
    two fixed studios instead of one.</p>

    <p>I always come back to this, that once settled, one works
    more tranquilly, and in that position one can always on
    occasion be more of a help to other people. Bernard says it
    grieves him to see how Gauguin is often prevented from doing
    what he could otherwise do for purely material reasons, paints,
    canvas, etc. Well, in any case, that can't go on. The worst
    that can happen to him is that he will be obliged to leave his
    pictures in pledge for what he owes his landlord, and to take
    refuge either with you or with me by making the one-way
    journey. But in this case, if he does not want to lose his
    pictures, he must definitely tackle his landlord. A case like
    that, in which the goods are at all events worth more than the
    debt, might be tried <i>expressly</i> by the <i>president of
    the civil tribunal of the arrondissement</i>, assuming the
    landlord should want to keep the whole, which he has no right
    to do.</p>
