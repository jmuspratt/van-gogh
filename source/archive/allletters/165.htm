  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>As Father and Mother are sending you a letter, I'm enclosing
    a word, but I hope to write you at length soon, that is, after
    Mauve has been here; he is expected one of these days at
    Prinsenhage and will also come here.<label content="art.materials"> You must know, Theo, that
    Mauve has sent me a paintbox with paint, brushes, palette,
    palette knife, oil, turpentine - in short, everything
    necessary.</label> So it is now settled that I shall begin to paint,
    and I am glad things have gone so far.</p>

    <p>Well, I have been drawing a good deal recently, especially
    studies of the figure. If you saw them now, you would see in
    what direction I am going. Of course, I am now longing to hear
    what Mauve will have to say. The other day I made some drawings
    of children, too, and liked it very much.<art id=880></art><art id=881></art>
    <art id=884></art><art id=873></art></p>

    <p>These are days of great beauty in tone and colour; after I
    have made some progress in painting, I will succeed in
    expressing a little of it. But we must stick to the point, and
    now that I have begun drawing the figure, I will continue it
    until I am more advanced; and when I work in the open air, it
    is to make studies of trees, viewing the trees like real
    figures. I mean especially with a view to the outline, the
    proportion and the construction - that is the first thing one
    has to consider. Then comes the modelling and the colour and
    the surroundings, and it is about these that I need Mauve's
    advice.</p>

    <p>But, Theo, I am so very happy with my paintbox, and I think
    my getting it now, after having drawn almost exclusively for at
    least a year, better than if I had started with it immediately.
    I think you will agree with me in this.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">Now in my last letter I forgot to tell you that I think it's
    fine that you are going to London. I should not like you to go
    and stay there, but it is a good thing to become acquainted
    with it.</label></p>

    <p>In the long run I do not think you would like it there, at
    least it becomes clearer and clearer to me that I never felt in
    my element there. Here in Holland I feel much more at home,
    yes, I think I shall again become a thorough Dutchman, and
    don't you think that's most reasonable, after all? I think I
    shall become quite a thorough Dutchman again, in character as
    well as in my drawing and painting style. But I think that my
    having been abroad for some time and my having seen a few
    things there which it is not superfluous to know will prove
    useful to me. When you get to London, I wish you would give my
    best regards to my old friends, George Read and Richardson.</p>

    <p>I met Mr. Obach at The Hague this summer.</p>

    <p>George Read is, if you like, a very ordinary man, in that he
    is not superior either in business or in knowledge; but if one
    knows him somewhat intimately, as a man and a personality,
    there is none more faithful, more kind-hearted, more sensitive
    than he. He is so humorous and so witty, and so smart in
    everyday things, that he is quite a valuable friend in that
    respect. If I might choose whom I should most like to see again
    of all my acquaintances in England, it would certainly be
    George Read. Therefore, if you would do me a favour, you must
    be sure to look him up and tell him that I hope we will renew
    our former acquaintance, and that I will write to him
    someday.</p>

    <p>But I will do so only after you have seen him and after I
    have started painting.</p>

    <p>For, Theo, with painting my real career begins. Don't you
    think I am right to consider it so?</p>

    <p>And now adieu, a handshake in thought, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
