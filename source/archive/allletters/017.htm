  <body>
    <p>[Note by Jo Bonger-van Gogh. Before going to Holland,
    Vincent declared his love to Ursula Loyer, but heard that she
    was already engaged to be married, so he came home in a
    melancholy mood.]</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter. I intend to leave here on Thursday,
    June 25, or Saturday, June 27, if nothing interferes. <label content="feelings.homesick">I am
    longing so much for everybody and for Holland. </label>I am also
    anxious to have a good talk with you about art; think it over
    and perhaps you will have some questions to put to me. We have
    many beautiful things here, including a fine picture by Jacquet
    and a beautiful Boldini.</p>

    <p>There are beautiful things in the Royal Academy this year.
    Tissot has three pictures there. Lately I took up drawing
    again, but it did not amount to much.</p>

    <p>I was glad to see from your letter that you often visit the
    Haanebeeks. &Agrave; Dieu, we shall meet soon. My compliments
    to all the friends.</p>

    <p>Ever your brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>I am glad you like C&eacute;sar de Cock so much; he is one
    of the few painters who understands our dear Brabant
    intimately. I do not know if I told you that I met him in Paris
    last year.</p>
