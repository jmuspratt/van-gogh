    <p>Sunday afternoon</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>As I told you in yesterday's letter, I have been to Leyden.
    Sien was confined last night; has had a very difficult
    delivery, but thank God has come out of it alive and with a
    particularly nice little boy as well.</p>

    <p>Her mother and little girl and I went there together - you
    can imagine how very anxious we were, not knowing what we
    should hear when we asked the orderlies in the hospital about
    her. And how tremendously glad we were when we heard:
    &ldquo;Confined last night&hellip;but you mustn't talk to her
    for long...&rdquo; I shall not easily forget that &ldquo;you
    mustn't talk to her for long&rdquo;; for it meant &ldquo;you
    can still talk to her,&rdquo; when it could easily have been,
    &ldquo;you will never talk to her again.&rdquo; Theo, I was so
    happy to see her there, lying close to a window overlooking a
    garden full of sunshine and greenery, in a sort of drowsy state
    of exhaustion between sleeping and waking, and then she looked
    up and saw us all. Ah, my dear fellow, she looked up and was so
    happy to see us exactly 12 hours after it had happened, as luck
    would have it, even though there is only 1 hour a week when
    visits are allowed. And she perked up so, and in a moment she
    had got her wits about her and asked about everything.</p>

    <p>But what I cannot marvel at enough is the child, because
    although it was delivered by forceps it is not injured in any
    way and just lay in its cradle with a sort of worldly-wise air.
    How clever these doctors are! But by all accounts it was a
    critical case. There were 5 professors standing by when it
    happened and they put her under with chloroform. Before that,
    she had suffered a tremendous amount because the child was
    stuck fast from 9 in the evening until half-past one. And she
    is still in a lot of pain now. But she forgot everything when
    she saw us and even managed to convey that we should soon be
    back drawing again, and I should not mind in the least if her
    prediction came true. There has been no rupture or anything,
    which can easily happen in such cases.</p>

    <p>Heavens, how grateful I am! Still, the grim shadow goes on
    threatening, as master Albrecht D&uuml;rer realized only too
    well when he placed Death behind the young couple in that
    marvellous etching you know. But let us hope that the grim
    shadow will remain a passing shadow.</p>

    <p>Well, Theo, I don't have to tell you that without your help,
    Sien would probably not be here any longer. One more thing, I
    had urged Sien to ask the professor to give her a thorough
    examination, because she often had something they call the
    whites. And he did that and told her what she must do to get
    well again. And he says that she had been very close to giving
    up the ghost more than once, especially when she had had
    quinsy, during an earlier miscarriage, and again this winter -
    that she was thoroughly enfeebled by years of worry and
    agitation, and that now, when she no longer has to lead that
    sort of life, she will get well by herself if nothing else
    happens, through rest, through restoratives, by being out in
    the fresh air a great deal and by not doing any heavy work.</p>

    <p>With her earlier misfortune behind her, a completely new
    period of her life will start, and though she cannot regain her
    spring, which is past and was but barren, her <i>midsummer
    growth</i> will be all the greener for it. You will know how in
    the middle of the summer, when the greatest heat is over, the
    trees put out fresh young shoots, a new young layer of green
    over the old, weathered one.</p>

    <p>I am writing to you at Sien's mother's, beside a window
    overlooking a sort of courtyard. I have drawn it twice,<art id=942> once on
    a large scale</art> and once on <art id=941>a smaller one</art>.
    <label content="business.sales"> C. M. has those two and they were the ones Rappard was
    pleased with, especially the large one.</label> I should like you to
    have a look at them if you happen to be at C. M.'s, for I
    should like to know what you think, especially of the larger
    one. When are you coming? I look forward to seeing you very
    much.</p>

    <p>Well, brother, you are to blame for my being so happy today
    that it made me cry. Thanks for everything, my dear fellow, and
    believe me, with a handshake in my thoughts,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
