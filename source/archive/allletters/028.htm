    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I had hoped to revisit her before her death <sup>1</sup>,
    but it was not to have been. L'homme s'agite et Dieu le
    m&egrave;ne [Man proposes and God disposes.]</p>

    <p>In the first box that we shall send to Holland you will find
    a photograph of that picture by Ph. De Champagne of which
    Michelet says, &ldquo;It stayed in my memory for thirty years,
    coming back to me incessantly.&rdquo; Further, an etching by
    Daubigny after Ruysdael, &ldquo;The Bush&rdquo;; a lithograph
    after Corot, &ldquo;Sunset&rdquo;; a lithograph by Bodmer,
    &ldquo;Fontainebleau in Autumn&rdquo;; and two etchings by
    Jacque. &Agrave; Dieu.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I do not know how long I will stay here; nevertheless, I
    hope to go to Helvoirt before returning to London, and I would
    like to believe that you will be there as well. I will pay for
    the trip.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.death">You will certainly not forget her, or her death, but it is
    better to keep that to yourself.</p>

    <p>It is one of those things that, as time goes by, we
    &ldquo;are sorrowful but always rejoicing&rdquo;; that is what
    we have to learn.</label></p>
