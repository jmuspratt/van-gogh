  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">Enclosed you will find an order for paints to replace the
    one in my last letter</label>. We have had some glorious days and I
    have set even more canvases going, so that there are twelve
    size 30 canvases in prospect.<label content="art.technique"> Two studies
    of <art id=0620>cypresses of that difficult bottle-green hue; I have worked their foregrounds
    with thick layers of white lead, which gives firmness to the
    ground.</art></p>

    <p>I think that very often the Monticellis were prepared like
    this. You put other colours on that. But I do not know if the
    canvases are strong enough for that sort of work.</label></p>

    <p>Speaking of Gauguin and Bernard, and that they may well give
    us painting of greater consolation. I must however add what I
    have also said many a time to Gauguin himself, namely that we
    must not then forget that others have done it already. But
    however it may be, outside Paris you quickly forget Paris, when
    throwing yourself into the heart of the country, your ideas
    change; but I for one cannot forget all those lovely canvases
    of Barbizon, and it seems hardly probable that anyone will do
    better than that, and unnecessary besides.</p>

    <p>What is Andr&eacute; Bonger doing; you have not
    mentioned him in the last two or three letters.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">As for me, my health remains very good and work distracts
    me.</label> I have received - probably from one of our sisters - a book
    by Rod, which is not bad, but the title Le Sens de la vie is
    really a little pretentious for the contents, it seems to
    me.</p>

    <p>It certainly is not very cheering. I think the author must
    be suffering a good deal from his lungs and consequently a
    little from everything.</p>

    <p>Anyway, he admits that he finds consolation in the
    companionship of his wife, which is all to the good, but after
    all, for my own use he teaches me nothing about the meaning of
    life, whatever is meant by it. For my part I might well think
    him a little trite and be surprised that he has had a book like
    that published these days and gets it sold at 3.50 fr.
    Altogether I prefer Alphonse Kair, Souvestre and Droz because
    they are a bit more alive than this. It's true that I am
    perhaps ungrateful, not even appreciating Abb&eacute;
    Constantin and other literary works, which gave lustre to the
    gentle reign of the naive Carnot. It seems that this book has
    made a great impression on our good sisters. At least, Wil had
    mentioned it to me, but good women and books are two different
    things.</p>

    <p>I have reread with much pleasure Zadig ou la
    destin&eacute;e bv Voltaire. It is like Candide. Here the
    mighty author gives at least a glimpse of the possibility that
    life may have some meaning, though it is agreed in conversation
    that things in this world do not always go as the wisest
    wish!</p>

    <p>As for me, I do not know what to wish, to work here or
    elsewhere now seems to come to very much the same thing, and
    being here, staying here seems the simplest thing to do.</p>

    <p>Only I have no news to tell you, for the days are all the
    same; I have no ideas, except to think that a field of wheat or
    a cypress is well worth the trouble of looking at close up, and
    so on.</p>

    <p>I have <art id=0617>a wheat field, very yellow and very light, perhaps
    the lightest canvas I have done</art>.</p>

    <p>The cypresses are always occupying my thoughts, I should
    like to make something of them like the canvases of the
    sunflowers, because it astonishes me that they have not yet
    been done as I see them.</p>

    <p>It is as beautiful of line and proportion as an Egyptian
    obelisk. And the green has a quality of such distinction.</p>

    <p>It is a splash of <i>black</i> in a sunny landscape, but it
    is one of the most interesting black notes, and the most
    difficult to hit off exactly that I can imagine.</p>

    <p>But then you must see them against the blue, <i>in</i> the
    blue rather. To paint nature here, as everywhere, you must be
    in it a long time. Thus a Month&eacute;nard does not give
    me the true intimate note, for the light is mysterious, and
    Monticelli and Delacroix felt that. Then Pissarro used to talk
    very well about it in the old days, and I am still a long way
    from being able to do what he said would have to be done.</p>

    <p>It would of course be a pleasure to me if you sent me the
    paints, if possible, soon, but above all do only what you can
    do without too much worry. So if you would rather send them to
    me at two different times, it will do just as well.</p>

    <p>[<art id=750_V-T_5960>A sketch of Cypresses was drawn here.</art>]</p>

    <p>I think that of the two canvases of cypresses, <art id=0613>the one I am
    making this sketch of will be the best. The trees in it are
    very big and massive. The foreground, very low with brambles
    and brushwood. Behind some violet hills, a sky green and pink
    with a crescent moon. The foreground especially is painted very
    thick, clumps of brambles with touches of yellow, violet and
    green</art>. I will send you <art id=1525>the drawings</art> of<art id=1524> it </art>with
    two other drawings that I have done too.</p>

    <p>That will keep me busy these days. The great question here
    is to find occupation for the day.</p>

    <p>What a pity one cannot shift this building here. It would be
    splendid to hold an exhibition in, all the empty rooms, the
    large windows.</p>

    <p>I should have very much liked to see that picture by
    Rembrandt which you spoke of in your last letter.</p>

    <p>Some time ago I saw in Braun's window a photo of a picture
    which must belong to the fine last period (probably in the
    Hermitage series). In this were great figures of angels, it was
    &ldquo;Abraham's Meat,&rdquo; five figures I think. That was
    extraordinary too. As moving as <art id=emmaus>the &ldquo;Men of
    Emmaus,&rdquo;</art> for instance.</p>

    <p>If later on there should ever be a question of giving
    something to M. Salles - for the trouble he has taken - we
    should give him Rembrandt's &ldquo;Men of Emmaus.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Is your health good? A handshake for you and your wife, I
    hope to send you some new drawings next week.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
