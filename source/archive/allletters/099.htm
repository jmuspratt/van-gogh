  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is already late and everyone is asleep, but I feel that I
    must write you once more.</p>

    <p>You tell me in your last letter that you dream of going to
    another city, if you get the chance, and you mention London or
    Paris. That isn't bad, I think, old son; I love those towns
    with all my heart, I know that I like certain aspects and that
    I detest others, or better, that I do not like certain things
    about the hawthorn hedges, green grass and the little grey
    churches. No, it is not a bad idea.</p>

    <p>Remember only that we both have to reach the cape of thirty
    to keep us from sin. Since the life that is given us, we have
    had to fight the good fight and to become men; but, we are not
    them anymore, neither one nor the other. My conscience tells me
    that there is a lot more to do to become perfect, we are far
    from the worth of others, but we have the ability to strive.
    You know I have the ambition. If I one day have the joy to
    become a pastor and to acquit my task like our father, I will
    thank God.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I have strong hopes of
    success: once somebody who was more advanced in life than I and who was no stranger to Jerusalem -
    meaning he had sought after it and found it - said to me,
    &ldquo;I believe you are a Christian.&rdquo; It did me so much
    good to hear this!</label> Whatever you wish for yourself, too, hold
    firm to the thought of Christ and treasure His word - just as
    you do. It is good to believe that there is a God who knows
    what we want better than we do ourselves, and Who helps us
    whenever we are in need of it. And it is also good to believe
    that now, just as in olden days, an angel is not far from those
    who are sad - strengthened unto God - not only to those who are
    nearly angels themselves, but particularly to those who want
    the help of a higher power to be preserved from the evil, from
    the badness which we know is in the world and not far away from
    us - not far from those who are broken-hearted and dejected in
    spirit. I have often read the story of Elijah with care; so
    often has it fortified me even to this day:</p>

    <p>And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and
    came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his
    servant there. But he himself went a day's journey into the
    wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he
    requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is
    enough: now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better
    than my fathers. And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree,
    behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and
    eat. And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the
    coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and
    drink, and laid him down again. And the angel of the Lord came
    again a second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat;
    because the journey is too great for thee. And he arose, and
    did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty
    days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.</p>

    <p>And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and,
    behold, the word of the Lord came to him, &hellip; What doest
    thou here, Elijah? And he said, I have been very jealous for
    the Lord God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken
    thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets
    with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my
    life, to take it away. And he said, Go forth, and stand upon
    the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and
    a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces
    the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind:
    and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the
    earthquake: and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was
    not in the fire: and after the fire a small still voice. And it
    was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his
    mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.
    And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest
    thou here, Elijah? And he said, I have been very jealous for
    the Lord God of hosts! &hellip; And the Lord said unto him, Go,
    return on thy way &hellip;</p>

    <p>And this story is not the only one; we read of the angel
    who, in Gethsemane, gave strength unto Him Whose soul was
    sorrowful even unto death; of the angel who awakened Peter from
    his sleep in prison; of the angel who appeared to Paul in the
    night, and said, &ldquo;Fear not.&rdquo; And we, even if we
    should not see an angel, even though we are not like men of
    old, should we not know that there is strength from above? This
    afternoon there was a gale blowing here, and it rained, and I
    walked to the sea along the Jewish cemetery, and a few days ago
    I also took a walk to the spot of the Buitenkant near the East
    Railway where they are working on that sand embankment, etc.
    How beautiful and inspiring is that story of Jesus walking on
    the sea, Matthew 14 : 22 - 33.</p>

    <p>And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into
    a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent
    multitudes away. And when he had sent the multitudes away, he
    went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was
    come, he was there alone. But the ship was now in the midst of
    the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary. And in
    the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on
    the sea. And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea,
    they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out
    for fear. But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of
    good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. And Peter answered him and
    said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.
    And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the
    ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw
    the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he
    cried, saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched
    forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou
    little of faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? And when they were
    come into the ship, the wind ceased.</p>

    <p>Believe in God; through faith we may become &ldquo;sorrowful
    yet always rejoicing&rdquo; and ever green, and we need not
    complain when our youth flies with the maturing of our
    strength.</p>

    <p>Herewith something else by Esquiros. Be as happy as
    possible, write soon again; compliments to the Roos family and
    other acquaintances you may meet, a handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
