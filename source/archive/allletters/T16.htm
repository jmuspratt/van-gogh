    <p>Letter T 16<br>
     Paris, 5 September 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>You gave me great pleasure by writing me a letter; when one
    knows nothing one is inclined to think things are worse than
    they really are. It is bad enough in itself that you have had a
    crisis, but fortunately I see from your letter that at present
    you are feeling better. The view from your window - which you
    give a sketch of - ought to be very fine; in Paris one is
    sometimes dying for a look at the real countryside - at least
    you have a fragment of it at your disposal. In the environs of
    Paris you never see any peasants, and in truth I no longer know
    the harvest times for wheat and potatoes. It is a fact that in
    town you meet people who are certainly interesting too, but at
    times you have had enough of it, and so, as long as you cannot
    go there, a picture of the true countryside does you good, and
    certainly at such moments of surfeit a Bodmer<sup>1</sup> will give you as much pleasure,
    or rather more than some picture done with a scientifically clever technique,
    but without that true and wholesome something which is to be
    found in a slice of brown bread. Rousseau too has something of
    this knowledge. At the exhibition there are pictures of his
    with bits of forest, in which you can recognize all the species
    of trees with an undergrowth of true heath and true toadstools
    beneath. Surely if such fellows are no artists&mdash;and one
    would have to be damned exacting not to take them as
    such&mdash;in any case they are <i>men</i>, and one should wish
    the world to be full of them.</p>

    <p>There you have old Father Pissarro, <sup>2</sup> who,
    notwithstanding everything, has done very fine things recently,
    and in them you also find those qualities of rusticity which
    show immediately that man is more at ease in wooden shoes than
    in patent-leather boots. A short time ago he lost his mother,
    who was very old, and yet it was a hard blow for him; he also
    had an operation performed on one of his eyes, but I do not
    think it was improved by it. He is continually wearing some
    kind of muzzle, which bothers him a good deal . . . He has
    great difficulty selling his stuff, and he has been through
    hard times, but he is always full of courage. One of his sons
    is in London, and it appears that they have schools there where
    one is taught decorative art, and where the pupils are
    absolutely free to treat the subject as they understand it. The
    first thing they gave him to do was a frieze composed of
    brambles. It would be a good thing if they did the same here,
    for by letting the fellows follow their own inclinations, they
    would find ornaments drawn from the source of nature, and the
    result might be a great change in the art of interior
    decoration, etc. It is a pity that the impressionists are
    unknown in England; there must be people over there who would
    like them.</p>

    <p>This week Tersteeg sent me eight watercolours by J.H.
    Weissenbruch, who in parentheses is not dead; they are very,
    very fine. Although he does not concern himself with details of
    the vegetation, he knows the character of the Dutch countryside
    as Daumier knows his barristers - the misshapen trees, the
    muddy paths across the meadows, and how his skies are like
    those you see in Holland! I am very glad that Tersteeg has had
    the courage to buy them from him; he is always the same: he
    invariably begins by saying No, and then after some time he
    goes back on it, and often changes his mind. Here where they
    have understood Jongkind, <sup>3</sup> they will also be able
    to understand this one. In any case one might try it.</p>

    <p>Gauguin has sent me some new canvases. He tells me that he
    hesitated to send them, because what he is striving for is not
    in them as he should have wished. He says he did find it in
    other canvases, which are not dry yet. However, in my opinion
    it is a certain fact that this consignment is not as good as
    the one he sent last year; there is <i>one</i> canvas, however,
    which is a really fine Gauguin once again. He calls it
    &ldquo;La Belle Ang&egrave;le.&rdquo; It is a portrait put
    down on the canvas like the big heads in the Japanese
    cr&ecirc;pons; there is the bust-portrait with its
    outlines and then the background. It is a Breton woman, seated,
    the hands folded, black dress, lilac apron, and a white ruff;
    the outlines are grey and the background of a beautiful blue
    lilac with pink and red flowers. The expression of the head and
    the attitude are very well found. The woman is somewhat like a
    young cow, but there is something so fresh in it, and then
    again something so countrified, that it is very pleasant to
    see.</p>

    <p>Now I still have to tell you that the exhibition of the
    Independents is open, and that your two pictures are there, <art id=0608>the
    &ldquo;Irises&rdquo;</art> and <art id=0474>&ldquo;The Starlit
    Night.&rdquo;</art> The latter is hung badly, for
    one cannot put oneself at a sufficient distance, as the room is
    very narrow, but the other one makes an extremely good showing.
    They have put it on the narrow wall of the room, and it strikes
    the eye from afar. It is a beautiful study full of air and
    life. There are some Lautrecs, which are very powerful in
    effect, among other things a Ball at the Moulin de la Galette,
    which is very good. The painters could only send in two
    pictures each, as the exhibition is held in a much smaller
    place than the one it was held in till now.</p>

    <p>Seurat has sea beaches, Signac two landscapes. There is also
    a picture by Hayet, the friend of Lucien Pissarro's, the Place
    de la Concorde in the evening with carriages, the gas jets,
    etc. It is something like that picture of the Tumblers
    [Saltimbanques] by Seurat, but it is more harmonious.<label content="Theo.health"> We are in
    good health, I hardly cough any more, and am feeling stronger.</label>
    Jo too is quite well; one begins to see that she is pregnant,
    but it does not hinder her yet. One of the sisters is staying
    with us at the moment. Mother has had a letter from Cor; he is
    far away already, and was in good health.</p>

    <p>Do write me a few words if you feel like it, and once again
    many thanks for your letter.</p>

    <p>Be of good heart; and a cordial handshake, also from Jo.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
