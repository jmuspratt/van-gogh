  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your last letter and also for the catalogue sent
    in the last box. Have I thanked you already for Andersen's
    tales? If not I do so now.</p>

    <p>From home I have heard that this spring you will have to
    travel on business, you will not be sorry for that, I suppose;
    it is a good experience and you will see many beautiful things
    in your travels.</p>

    <p>In the next box you will find the Longfellow. Yesterday
    evening Gladwell was with me, he comes every Friday and we
    read poetry together. I have not read &ldquo;Hyperion&rdquo;
    yet, but I have heard that it is very beautiful.</p>

    <p>I have just read a very beautiful book by Eliot, three
    tales, called &ldquo;Scenes from Clerical Life&rdquo;; the last
    story in particular, &ldquo;Janet's Repentance,&rdquo; struck
    me very much. It is the life of a clergyman who lives chiefly
    among the inhabitants of the dirty streets of a town, his study
    looks out on the gardens with stumps of cabbage, etc., and on
    the red roofs and smoking chimneys of poor tenements. For his
    dinner he usually had nothing but underdone mutton and watery
    potatoes. He died at the age of thirty-four and during his long
    illness he was nursed by a woman who was a drunkard, but by his
    teaching, and leaning as it were on him, she had conquered her
    weakness and found rest for her soul. At his burial they read
    the chapter which says, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the
    life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall
    he live.&rdquo; And now it is again Saturday evening, for the
    days pass so quickly and the time for my departure will soon be
    here. No answer as yet from Scarborough. Kind greetings and a
    handshake, always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
