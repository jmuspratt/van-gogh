    <p>[Reprinted from Benno J. Stokvis, LL. D., Nasporingen
    omtrent (Investigations concerning) Vincent van Gogh in Brabant
    (Amsterdam, S. L. van Looy, 1926.)]</p>

    <p>Etten</p>

    <p>Etten-Leur, a small village between Breda and Roozendaal,
    makes a far less prosperous impression than Zundert. However,
    it appears that there are no fewer Protestants here than in the
    latter village.</p>

    <p>After having been stationed at Helvoirt for some years, the
    Rev. Mr. Van Gogh came to Etten in 1875 as successor to the
    Rev. Mr. Peaux (father of the poetess Augusta Peaux). He
    remained there until 1882. Here his intercourse seems to have
    been limited to the members of his own parish more than it was
    in Zundert. However, here too non-Catholics and Catholics
    remember him with equal sympathy.</p>

    <p>If anyone failed to appear in church on a Sunday, he could
    be sure that the Rev. Mr. Van Gogh would look him up that very
    week to lecture him, however far in the &ldquo;interior,&rdquo;
    however remote from the village, his farm might be situated. He
    even visited the people living on the most distant farms
    regularly.</p>

    <p>The Rev. Mr. Van Gogh was charitable: at times he
    distributed more among the poor than the consistory could
    approve of. But at the same time he was described as a severe
    and forceful personality. This observation may help to dispel
    the notion advanced in some writings on Vincent that the father
    behaved in a spineless, powerless fashion toward his son (in
    support of which, I refer to letters 158 and 159).</p>

    <p>Although the people of Zundert were in general fully aware
    of Vincent's fame as a painter, in Etten I was struck by an
    almost complete ignorance on the subject. Neither old villagers
    who had known him personally, nor even his one-time models whom
    I met, knew that he had made a name for himself; and when I
    told them so, they looked amazed - they would never have
    expected such a thing of &ldquo;that Vincent&rdquo;!</p>

    <p>I asked an old Protestant woman whether she had known the
    Rev. Mr. Van Gogh's son, &ldquo;who had drawn.&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Drawn?&rdquo; was the counter-question. &ldquo;You mean
    to say he was drawn into the East Indian army?&rdquo; Though
    such intellectual agility on the old lady's part may provoke
    laughter, from a psychological point of view such an answer
    proves, after all, how little Vincent's activities were
    actually taken seriously.</p>

    <p>The painter returned repeatedly to Etten; the last time he
    stayed there for about one year. So he was present at the
    wedding of his sister Anna at Etten, at which the Rev. Mr. Van
    Gogh himself officiated.</p>

    <p>The following persons were interviewed by me:</p>

    <p><i>J. A. Oosteryck's</i> father was an elder of the church
    under the Rev. Mr. Van Gogh. Vincent often used to drop in upon
    the Oosterycks and would then make drawings indoors and in the
    granary. Once he made a portrait of my informant's mother which
    was a very good likeness. His father was also immortalized by
    Vincent in a large picture of him ploughing his field.</p>

    <p>According to the son the picture of his father's figure did
    not look like him, but for the rest, &ldquo;a photograph could
    not have been more perfect.&rdquo; When the painting was
    finished, old Mr. Oosteryck happened to remark that Vincent had
    forgotten to put in the dog. Vincent obligingly took up his
    brushes and added the dog. Those for whom Vincent had a liking
    [literally, &ldquo;who had a good odour in his nostrils&rdquo;]
    were given a drawing by him more than once. Vincent worked a
    great deal in the vicinity of the village; he was highly
    respected by the farmers.<label content="lifestyle.appearance"> When he set off for work, he
    generally wore a sort of raincoat and a sou'wester. In general
    his attire was rough [&ldquo;raw&rdquo;]. Every day he might be
    seen walking with a small campstool under one arm and a square
    frame (??) under the other, always staring straight in front of
    him, and he took little notice of people. Without doing
    strikingly eccentric things, he yet seemed a queer sort of
    man.</label></p>

    <p>When Vincent was busy painting, he did not like to be
    watched; if anyone stood watching him longer than he liked, he
    unreservedly begged the importunate person to clear off. At
    times he was anything but meek.</p>

    <p>Toward the poor he always showed himself exceedingly
    open-handed; he once gave a beggar his own velvet suit, which
    was as good as new. Now and then he would hand over a number of
    drawings to his father for distribution among the members of
    the consistory. If a drawing did not come off
    &ldquo;choicely&rdquo; enough to his taste, he immediately tore
    it up.</p>

    <p>Opinion on the work of the painter was briefly formulated in
    the words, &ldquo;All that he made was as accurate as a
    photograph.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><i>C.</i><i>Kerstens</i> has for many years been the
    occupant of an outlying farm. He used to know Vincent well,
    though the latter did not come his way very often. It was
    intimated with emphasis that Vincent made his drawings and
    paintings almost exclusively among the Protestants. The artist
    had &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; ways. As a rule he walked all alone.
    He was of &ldquo;sturdy build.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><i>A. de Graaf</i>. Informant is now seventy-six years old.
    In the time of the Rev. Mr. Van Gogh he was the verger at the
    Protestant church.</p>

    <p>A carpenter by profession, in this capacity he made the
    above-mentioned folding stool for Vincent, who thenceforth took
    it with him when he went out painting. Vincent had drawn a
    rough model of the stool on a board, and De Graaf put it
    together accordingly.</p>

    <p>Vincent was a &ldquo;good boy,&rdquo; who would go all over
    the place to make his little sketches. This occupied him
    continually and was all he spoke of. He wasn't the least bit
    proud, and was a regular visitor in the houses of poor people.
    He was a serious man, who never made jokes.</p>

    <p>Now and then the Rev. Mr. Van Gogh would confide to De Graaf
    that &ldquo;there was such an extraordinary spirit in
    Vincent,&rdquo; and that he would have liked so much to make a
    preacher of him.</p>

    <p><i>Piet Kauffmann</i>, a still strong and active man of
    sixty. He often served as Vincent's model, and Vincent
    repeatedly mentioned him in his letters (e.g. in letter 148:
    &ldquo;I think I shall find a good model here in Piet Kaufman,
    the gardener, but I think it will be better to let him pose
    with a spade or plough or something like that - not here at
    home, but either in the yard or in his own home or in the
    field.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Note the wrong spelling: Piet Kaufman!)</p>

    <p>Put on the trail by finding this reference, I set out to
    find him. According to some whom I questioned he had been dead
    a long time, and had not left any children; but I know that to
    err is human, and in some respects I had come to know something
    of the &ldquo;southerly&rdquo; imagination of the North-Brabant
    people, and consequently I decided not to take the man's death
    for granted before I had beheld his tombstone with my own eyes.
    So I refused to be discouraged, and in a pub at Leur, about an
    hour's walk from Etten, I had the satisfaction of meeting him,
    very much alive.</p>

    <p>He could remember the painter quite clearly. At the time
    when Kauffmann posed for Vincent, he was the Rev. Mr. Van
    Gogh's gardener and seventeen years old. Vincent often made
    drawings of him at the parsonage, especially on Saturdays: as a
    rule Kauffmann posed standing, holding a rake or spade. Vincent
    also drew pictures of him a number of times as a sower, with a
    piece of cloth hanging from his shoulders.</p>

    <p>At times Vincent would work on a drawing for hours: he
    worked on until he had caught the expression he was aiming at.
    The Rev. T. van Gogh's servant girl at that time used to tell
    how Vincent would occasionally continue to paint all through
    the night: many a time it happened that his mother found him
    still at work when she came down in the morning. Often Vincent
    would not take time for lunch: at such times his mother would
    call him repeatedly, and he would keep answering, &ldquo;Yes,
    I'm coming,&rdquo; but all the same he would either not make an
    appearance at all, or come more than an hour later.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.appearance">Generally Vincent went about with a portfolio under one arm
    and a campstool under the other, and he used to hold his head a
    little to one side - &ldquo;he always walked lost in
    thought&rdquo;; he never recognized anybody in the street,
    &ldquo;he was a queer little fellow.&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>A few times Kauffmann received some drawings by way of a
    present, but they had been lost when he moved from one house to
    another. Informant estimates that he posed for Vincent some
    forty or fifty times.</p>

    <p><i>The Rev. Mr. Dijkman</i> showed me a map of the Holy Land
    which Vincent had drawn by hand; for years it hung on the
    vestry wall (until 1916).</p>

    <p>At Etten Vincent was not registered as a member of the
    Reformed Church.</p>

    <p>Data furnished by the registrar's office [often inaccurate -
    Ed.]:</p>

    <p>October 22, 1875. Arrival of the Van Gogh family in the
    municipality from Helvoirt.</p>

    Brussels: August 18, 1881.</p>

    <p>Departure of Vincent Willem for The Hague: July 20,
    1882.</p>

    <p>In the Register his profession is stated to be
    &ldquo;painter.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Some birth dates, accidentally found, may be mentioned here
    as a matter of curiosity:</p>

    <p>The Rev. T. Van Gogh: February 8, 1822.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Van Gogh-Carbentus : September 10, 1819.</p>

    <p>Cornelis Vincent (the painter's younger brother Cor): May
    17, 1867.</p>
