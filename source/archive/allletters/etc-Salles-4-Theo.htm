  <body>
    <p>Arles, 1<sup>st</sup> March 1889</p>

    <p>Monsieur,</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I have been to see your brother in hospital and found him
    tolerably well.</label> Everybody, the intern, the bursar and the board
    of directors, are well disposed in his regard, and it has been
    decided that someone will accompany him tomorrow to his house
    to fetch his brushes and colours to give him something to do
    during his stay in hospital.</p>

    <p>However, the question remains the same. The Central
    Commissioner, who has the petition I spoke to you about, and
    who conducted the inquest in the neighbourhood, remains
    convinced that he was right to take these measures.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile it seems to me, and it is also the view of M. Rey,
    that it would be a kind of cruelty to lock up a man who has not
    done any harm to anyone and who can, with kindness and good
    will, return to his normal state. I repeat, he has on his side
    the best will of all those that attend him at the hospice, and
    everything is being done to make it possible to avoid his
    transfer to a mental asylum.</p>

    <p>In any case, if they succeed in returning him to his normal
    state, it would be necessary that he gives up his current
    accommodation and move to another quarter of the city. This is
    the opinion of everybody.</p>

    <p>I give you my best regards, Sir, and my best wishes.
    Salles.</p>
