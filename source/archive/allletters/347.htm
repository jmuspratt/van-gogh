  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Mauve once told me, &ldquo;You will find yourself if you
    persist at your art, if you go more deeply into it than you
    have been doing up to now.&rdquo; He said that 2 years ago.</p>

    <p>Lately I have been thinking a lot about those words of his.
    I have found myself - I am that dog. The notion may be a bit
    overstated - real[ity] may have less pronounced, less starkly
    dramatic, contrasts - but I believe that fundamentally the
    rough character-sketch applies.</p>

    <p>The shaggy sheepdog I tried to portray for you in
    yesterday's letter is my character, and the animal's life is my
    life, if, that is, one omits the details and merely states the
    essentials. That may seem exaggerated to you - but I do not
    take it back.</p>

    <p>Personalities aside, just as an impartial character study -
    as if I were talking about strangers and not about you and me
    and Father - for the sake of analysis I draw your attention
    once more to last summer. I see two brothers walking in The
    Hague (look upon them as <i>strangers</i>, as <i>other
    people</i>, do not think of yourself or of me or Father).</p>

    <p>One of them says, &ldquo;I am getting more and more like
    Father - I have to maintain a certain social position - a
    certain affluence (very moderate both in your case and in
    Father's) - I must stay in business. I don't think I'm going to
    become a painter.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The other says, &ldquo;I am getting [less and less] like
    Father - I am turning into a dog, I feel that the future will
    probably make me uglier and rougher still and I foresee `a
    degree of <i>poverty'</i> as my lot - but, but, <i>man</i> or
    <i>dog</i>, I shall be a painter, in short a creature with
    feeling.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So, for the one, a certain position or affluence, and a
    dealer. For the other, a degree of poverty and exclusion, and a
    painter.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">And I see those same brothers in earlier years - when you
    had just entered the art world, had just begun to read, etc.,
    etc. - near the Rijswijk mill, or, for example, on a winter
    outing to Chaam across the snowy heath early one morning!
    <i>Feeling, thinking and believing the same</i> to such an
    extent - that I ask myself, can those be the same two? The
    question is, what will the outcome be - will they separate for
    ever, or will they take the same path once and for all?</label></p>

    <p>I tell you, <i>I am choosing the said dog's path</i>. I am
    remaining a <i>dog</i>, I shall be <i>poor</i>, I shall be a
    <i>painter</i>, I want to remain <i>human</i>, <i>in</i>
    nature. To my mind anyone who turns away from nature, whose
    head is forever filled with thoughts of keeping up this and
    keeping up that, even if that should remove him from nature to
    such an extent that he cannot help admitting it - oh, going on
    like that, one so easily arrives at a point where one can no
    longer tell white from black - and, and one becomes the precise
    opposite of what one is taken for or believes oneself to
    be.</p>

    <p>For instance at present you still have a manly fear of
    mediocrity in the worst sense of that word. Why then, in spite
    of that, are you going to kill, to extinguish the best in your
    soul? Then, yes, then your fear might well come true. How does
    one become mediocre? By complying with and conforming to one
    thing today and another tomorrow as the world dictates, by
    never contradicting the world and by heeding public
    opinion!</p>

    <p>Do not misunderstand me, what I am trying to say is just
    that basically you are better than that - I see this when, for
    example, you take Father's part once you think I have made
    things difficult for Father. If I may say so, to my mind your
    opposition in that case is misdirected. I do appreciate what
    you are doing, and I say, do be more sensible, direct your
    anger elsewhere and fight with the same strength against other
    influences than, of all things, mine, and, and then you will
    probably be less upset.</p>

    <p>I don't mind Father when I consider him on his own, but I do
    mind him when I compare him with the great Father Millet, for
    instance. His doctrine is so great that Father's way of
    thinking looks extremely petty by comparison. Now you will
    think this is terrible of me - I can't help that - it is my
    deep conviction and I confess it freely, because <i>you</i>
    confuse <i>Father's</i> character with Corot's, for instance.
    How do I see Father? As someone with the same kind of character
    as <i>Corot's father</i> - but Father has nothing of Corot
    himself. Anyway, Corot loved his father,
    <i>but</i><i>did</i><i>not</i><i>follow him</i>. I love Father,
    too, so long as my path is not made too difficult by
    differences of opinion. I do <i>not</i> love Father at the
    moment, when a certain petty-minded pride stands in the way of
    the generous and satisfactory accomplishment of a complete,
    permanent and most desirable reconciliation.</p>

    <p>I had no intention whatever of putting you or Father to
    expense by the steps I had in mind when I came back home. On
    the contrary, I wanted to use the money to better advantage so
    that we should lose less, that is, less time, less money and
    less energy. Am I to be blamed when I point to the Rappards
    who, although richer than Father or you or I, manage things
    more sensibly and get better results from acting in concord,
    though it is probably not always very easy for them either?</p>

    <p>Am I to be blamed for wanting to put an end to the discord
    in the family with a &ldquo;thus far but no further&rdquo;? In
    what respect am I wrong for wanting this to be brought about
    <i>thoroughly</i> and conclusively and for <i>not being
    content</i> with a <i>sham</i> or a too <i>half-hearted</i>
    reconciliation? Reconciliation with mental reservations,
    conditions, etc., bah! It just won't do. <i>Readily</i> or
    <i>not at all</i> - with empressement [eagerness], otherwise it
    is absolutely useless and worse may be expected.</p>

    <p>You say you think it <i>cowardly</i> of me to rebel against
    Father. In the first place this is a verbal rebellion - no
    violence is involved. On the other hand it might be argued that
    I am all the sadder and more disappointed and I speak all the
    more gravely and resolutely precisely because Father's grey
    hairs make it evident to me that the time left to us for
    reconciliation is perhaps, in truth, not very long. I do not
    much care for deathbed reconciliations, I prefer to see them
    <i>during life</i>.</p>

    <p>I am quite prepared to grant that Father means well, but I
    should far rather it didn't stop at meaning well but might,
    <i>for once</i>, lead to a mutual understanding, though it has
    been left very late. But I am afraid it will never happen! If
    you knew how sad I think this is, if you knew how I grieve over
    it.</p>

    <p>You say: Father has other things to think about - oh,
    really, well, to my mind those things preventing Father from
    thinking matters through, year in, year out, are quite
    <i>unimportant</i>. And that is just the point - Father doesn't
    feel that there is anything to be reconciled about or to be
    made up, Father has other things to think about - very well -
    leave him to his other things, I am beginning to tell myself.
    Are you, too, sticking to <i>your</i> &ldquo;other
    things&rdquo;? Father says, &ldquo;We have always been good to
    you,&rdquo; etc., and I say, &ldquo;Oh, really, you may be
    satisfied, I am not.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Something better than the days of the Rijswijk mill - namely
    the same thing but for good and all - two poor brother artists
    - bound up in one and the same feeling, for one and the same
    nature and art - will it ever come to that? Or will the certain
    social position, the certain affluence, win the day? Oh, let
    them win it - but I foresee that it will only be for a while,
    that you will grow disillusioned with them before you are 30.
    And if not, well, if not - then, then, then - tant pis [too
    bad]<i>.</i> With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Enclosed in this letter]</p>

    <p>Dear brother, these are certainly ticklish questions to
    discuss, but do not take offense at my being unable to find
    better words for what is in my mind, and look upon my attempts
    to speak to you confidentially and unreservedly as a brother
    toward a brother, as a friend toward a friend.</p>

    <p>Theo, in the past I often quarreled with Father, because
    Father said dictatorially:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is like this,&rdquo; and I told him, &ldquo;Pa,
    you are contradicting yourself, what you say militates
    absolutely against what you vaguely feel at your heart's core,
    even if you do not want to feel it.&rdquo; Theo, I stopped
    quarreling with Father wholly and completely long ago, because
    it is now clear to me that Father has never reflected upon
    certain very important things, and never will reflect upon
    them, and that he clings to a system and does not reason, nor
    did he ever, nor will he ever reason on the basis of the naked
    facts. There are too <i>many</i> who do as he does, so that he
    always finds certain support and strength in the thought,
    Everyone thinks this about it (namely primarily all the
    well-regulated, respectable clergymen). But he has no other
    strength, and it is all built on convention and a system,
    otherwise it would collapse like any other vanity. Father does
    not wrestle with the plain truth. But now I am of the opinion
    that one is one's own enemy it one does not want to think
    things out, if one does not say (especially in one's youth):
    Look here, for myself I do not want to be sustained by a
    system, I want to attack things according to reason and
    conscience. I take less notice of my own father, though he is
    not a bad man, and though I do not speak about him, than I do
    of people in whom I find more truth.</p>

    <p>You see, dear brother, I feel a deep, deep, deep respect for
    Millet, Corot, Daubigny, Breton, Herkomer, Boughton, Jules
    Dupr&eacute;, etc., etc., Isra&euml;ls - I am far from
    confusing <i>myself</i> with them - I do not consider myself
    their equal - no - yet I say, however conceited or whatever
    else people may think me - for all this I say, <i>You</i> will
    show me the way, and I am ready to follow your example rather
    than Father's, or some schoolmaster's, or whoever else's.</p>

    <p>I myself find in Father and Tersteeg something of the school
    of Delaroche, Muller, Dabuffe, and so on - I may think it
    clever, I may be silent about it, may take it at its face
    value, I may even have a certain respect for - but all this
    does not prevent my saying, The least painter or man who
    wrestles directly with the naked truths of nature is more than
    you are.</p>

    <p>In short, my dear fellow, neither Father nor Tersteeg has
    given other than a spurious tranquillity to my conscience, and
    they have not given me freedom, not have they ever approved of
    my desire for freedom and plain truth and of my feeling of
    ignorance and darkness.</p>

    <p>Now, left to myself, I have not attained the light of what I
    wanted to do yet, never mind; but by resolutely rejecting their
    systems I think I have gained a certain hope that my exertions
    will not be unavailing.</p>

    <p>And that, before I close my eyes forever, I shall see the
    rayon blanc. However fierce the struggle in my mind may have
    been because of my not having found it, I have never regretted
    saying that I considered the rayon noir the rayon noir, and
    having definitely avoided it - except that one should not
    quarrel over it, and it I ever quarreled over it, it was a
    mistake.</p>

    <p>Now for myself, knowing what I know, I look at you and ask
    the question, &ldquo;What shall he do with it?&rdquo; Theo,
    when we quarreled a little some time ago in The Hague, and you
    said, I feel more and more drawn to Father, I told you, Boy,
    this is a difficult question, follow your own conscience. But
    since then I have tried to explain to you too that for myself I
    cannot find tranquillity in Father's and H. G. Tersteeg's way
    of thinking, the latter's being about the same, I think - and
    that I have become increasingly aware of the fact that there is
    a rayon noir and a rayon blanc and that I have found their
    light to be black and a mere convention compared to the cool
    honesty of Millet and Corot, for instance. Now I have been
    thinking all this over four years longer than you have, as I am
    four years older and calmer - in any case time and experience
    have induced me to reject and avoid certain things. And I do
    not want to influence you, but on the other hand I do not want
    to conceal myself from you, or to do otherwise than speak
    openly.</p>

    <p>I come to the following conclusion:</p>

    <p>What Father and Tersteeg tried to force on me as a
    <i>duty</i> was the <i>spectre</i> of a duty. What they
    <i>really</i> said was (though not in so many words)
    &ldquo;Earn money, and your life will become straight.&rdquo;
    Millet says to me: <i>Make your life straight</i> (at least try
    to do so and to wrestle with the naked truth), <i>and even
    earning money can be managed, and in this too you will not be
    dishonest</i>.</p>

    <p>And I felt then, and I feel more and more strongly now, that
    Father and Tersteeg, and for instance C. M. and I don't know
    who else (although they thought their intentions straight, and
    I do not suspect them of dishonesty - but as I said, I take
    them at their face value - and leave them alone), that they and
    all the influences of the past dragged me more and more
    <i>out</i> of nature. Now, whatever may be said of Millet, at
    least it was he who took me back <i>into</i> nature, more than
    any other might have been able to do in my desperate state of
    mind.</p>

    <p>My youth was gloomy and cold and sterile under the influence
    of the rayon noir. And, brother, essentially your youth too. My
    dear fellow, this time I will not flatter you. After all, I
    will reproach nobody but myself with it - yet the rayon noir is
    unutterably cruel - unutterably - And at this moment I feel
    within myself as many repressed tears as there are in a figure
    by Monteyne!</p>

    <p>But, brother, my very grief over so much proves to me that I
    myself have definitely <i>done</i> with the systems in
    question. I have suffered from them, but in my heart of hearts
    I no longer belong to that side of life. And now I say to you,
    as brother to brother and as friend to friend, Though your
    youth was gloomy and frustrated, <i>in the future</i> let us
    seek that soft light for which I know no better name than the
    white ray of light or the good.</p>

    <p>Not looking upon ourselves as having obtained it, of course,
    but as seeking it, believing in it with the foi de charbonnier.
    Whatever may be true of my losing patience with Father as well
    as with Tersteeg, etc., etc., do not think of me as being in
    the least influenced by hate or spitefulness toward them. I do
    not envy them, in my opinion they are not happy themselves, and
    in my heart of hearts I am certainly not their enemy nor do I
    bear them malice, neither do I look upon them as my enemies,
    although it is a fact that I do not recall their influence with
    much pleasure. I do not suspect them of wicked intentions. I
    think they do follow their conscience, but that it is haunted
    by ghosts. And I <i>do not</i> see in Millet or Corot that
    there were ghosts haunting <i>their</i> consciences. There I
    see greater calm and serenity of a higher quality. Once again:
    I am far removed from this myself. However, every study I make,
    every attempt in the direction of painting, every new love for
    or struggle with nature, successful or unsuccessful, gets me
    one little unsteady step nearer. As far as religion is
    concerned, I find less of it in Father than in Uncle Jan, for
    instance, though it stands to reason that many would say the
    reverse. I think Father the opposite of a man of faith. Well
    look here, going in for painting requires a certain foi de
    charbonnier because one <i>cannot</i> prove at the outset that
    it will succeed and everyone takes a gloomy view of it. But,
    Theo, though it be true that you as well as I begin with as
    many repressed tears as the figures by Monteyne and Grollo, at
    the same time we have a little quiet hope mixed with all our
    sadness. In the first years of hard struggling it may even be a
    sowing of tears, so be it, but we shall check them, and in the
    far distance we may have a little quiet hope of the
    harvest.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Since writing the enclosed letter, I have thought some more
    about your remarks and have spoken to Father again. I had as
    good as made up my mind not to stay on here - regardless of how
    they might take it or what the result might be. But then the
    conversation took a fresh turn when I said, I have been here
    now for 14 days and feel I have got no further than during the
    first half hour, had we understood each other better we should
    have settled all sorts of things by now - I have no time to
    waste and must reach a decision. A door has to be either open
    or shut, I cannot see how there can be anything in between, and
    in fact there cannot.</p>

    <p>It all ended with the little room at home where the mangle
    now stands being put at my disposal for storing my bits and
    pieces and if need be for use as a studio too. And a start has
    been made with clearing the room, which had not been done while
    things were still in the air.</p>

    <p>I want to tell you something that I appreciate better now
    than when I wrote to you about Father. My opinion has softened,
    not least because I can see that Father (and one of your hints
    seems to bear this out to some extent) is genuinely unable to
    follow me when I try to explain things to him. He hangs on to a
    <i>part</i> of what I say, and that makes no sense when it is
    taken out of context. This may all be due to more than one
    cause, but old age must bear most of the blame. Well, I respect
    old age and its weaknesses as much as <i>you</i> do, <i>even
    though</i> it may not seem so to you or you may not credit me
    with it. What I mean is that some of the things I should take
    amiss in a man in full possession of his mental powers, I shall
    probably put up with in Father's case - for the above-mentioned
    reasons.</p>

    <p>I also thought of Michelet's saying (who had it from a
    zoologist), &ldquo;Le m&acirc;le est tr&egrave;s
    sauvage.&rdquo; [The male is very savage.] And because at this
    time of my life I know myself to have strong passions and
    believe that I should have them, I grant that I may well be
    &ldquo;tr&egrave;s sauvage&rdquo; myself. And yet my passion
    subsides when I face someone weaker than myself, and then I
    don't fight. Although, mark you, taking issue in <i>words</i>
    or over principles with a man who holds a position in society,
    and please note, as a guide to man's spiritual life, is not
    only permissible but cannot possibly be cowardly. After all,
    our weapons are equal.</p>

    <p>Do please think it over, the more so as I tell you that for
    many reasons I want to give up even the verbal struggle,
    because it occasionally occurs to me that Father no longer has
    the full mental power it takes to concentrate one's thoughts on
    a single point. Yet in some cases a man's age grants him
    additional power.</p>

    <p>Getting to the heart of the matter, I take this opportunity
    of telling you that, in my view, it was Father's influence that
    made you concentrate on business more than is in your nature.
    And that I believe, no matter how certain you may now feel that
    you must remain a businessman, that a certain something in your
    original nature will <i>endure</i> and may well produce a
    stronger reaction than you bargain for.</p>

    <p>Since I know that our thoughts coincided during our early
    days at G. &amp; Co, that is, that both you and I then thought
    of becoming painters, but so deep down that we did not dare
    tell even each other straight out, it might well happen, in
    these later years, that we draw more closely together. The more
    so because of circumstances and conditions in the trade
    itself, which has undergone a change since our early years and
    in my view will change even more.</p>

    <p>At the time I did violence to myself, and was moreover so
    oppressed by the preoccupation that I was no painter, that
    <i>even</i><i>after I had left</i> G. &amp; Co, I never thought
    of becoming one but turned to something else (which was a
    second mistake on top of the first), feeling discouraged about
    my prospects because the timid, very timid, approaches to a few
    painters were not even acknowledged. I am telling you this, not
    because I want to <i>force</i> you to think as I do - I do not
    force anybody - but only out of a sense of fraternal and
    friendly concern.</p>

    <p>My views may sometimes be incongruous, that may well be so,
    but I do believe that there must be some truth in them and in
    their action and direction.</p>

    <p>It was not primarily for selfish reasons that I tried to get
    them to open up the house to me again, even to give me a
    studio. What I do feel is that, though we do not see eye to eye
    in many things, Father, you and I have the will to pull
    together, either all the time or by fits and starts. Our
    estrangement having already lasted so long, it can do no harm
    to place some weight on the other side, so that to the eyes of
    the world, too, we do not look more divided than we actually
    are, so that to the eyes of the world we do not seem to have
    gone to extremes.</p>

    <p>Rappard said to me, &ldquo;A human being is not a lump of
    peat, since a human being cannot bear being flung into a loft
    to be forgotten there.&rdquo; And he pointed out that he
    considered it a great misfortune for me not to be able to live
    at home. Do please give that some thought.</p>

    <p>I believe a little too much emphasis has been laid on the
    charge that I acted willfully or recklessly - well, you know
    that better than I do - when in fact I was forced to do certain
    things and could not act differently from the way they saw me
    act or wanted to see me act. And it was their biased view that
    my objectives were base, etc., which made me grow cold and feel
    quite indifferent toward many people.</p>

    <p>One more thing, brother - at this time of your life you
    would do well to reflect deeply on this: I believe you are in
    danger of taking a distorted view of a great many things, and I
    think you will have to examine your perspective on life very
    carefully and that your <i>life will improve</i> as a result. I
    am not saying this as if it were something I know and you do
    not, I am saying it because I am coming to see more and more
    how terribly hard it is to tell where one is right or where one
    is wrong.</p>
