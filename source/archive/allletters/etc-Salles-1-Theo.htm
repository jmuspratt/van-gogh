    <p>Salles 1 to Theo</p>

    <p>Eglise R&eacute;form&eacute;e d'Arles (Bouches-du-Rh&ocirc;ne),</p>
    <p>9, Rue de la Rotonde, Arles.</p>
    <p>31 December 1888</p>

    <p>Monsieur,</p>

    <p>I am going to give you news of your brother. <label content="health.mental">I have just
    seen him, and found him calm, in a state which does not show anything
    abnormal with him. Unfortunately, as a result of the insane act which
    required his admission to the hospital and the more
    than strange behaviour that he showed in that establishment, the doctors found it
    necessary to isolate him and place him in an isolated room which they can keep locked. It
    is their opinion that he must be transferred to a lunatic
    asylum and they have made a report to this effect to the Mayor.
    This report will cause an inquiry and the result will be sent
    to the Prefect, who will probably order your brother's
    transfer to Marseilles or Aix.</label></p>

    <p>I wanted to warn you of what is going on with respect to
    your brother, something of which he himself seems to fully
    understand. I repeat, I found him talking calmly and not raving any more than anyone else. He
    is amazed, even indignant (which could be sufficient to
    start another attack) that they keep him shut up in this way, and that they completely
    deprive him of his liberty.He would like to leave the hospital and go back home.
    'I think that I am quite capable of taking up my work again,' he told me.
    'Why then are they keeping me here like a prisoner?'</p>

    <p>He spoke to me of you and told me how much it astonished him that you had not written
    to him since you left. I promised him I would give you his news tonight. He would
    even have liked to send you a telegram to make you come here. I left him deeply
    saddened, and regretting that I was not able to bring any alleviation to his
    situation.</p>

    <p>I am entirely at your service and pray you, Sir, to believe me, your very devoted
    in Christ. Salles.</p>
