    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.death">So at last our uncle's sufferings are over. I received the
    news this morning from our sister. It appears that they were
    more or less expecting you to be at the funeral, so perhaps you
    will indeed be there.</p>

    <p>How short life is and how like smoke. Which is no reason for
    despising the living, on the contrary.</label></p>

    <p>So we are right to care more for the artists than for the
    pictures.</p>

    <p>I am working hard for Russell, I thought that I would do him
    a series of drawings after my painted studies; I believe that
    he will look upon them kindly, and that, at least I hope so,
    will help to bring him to make a deal.</p>

    <p>McKnight came again yesterday to see me, and he also liked
    <art id=0431>the portrait of the girl</art>, and said besides
    that he liked <art id=0430>my Garden</art>. I really do not know if he has money
    or not.</p>

    <p>I am now at work with another model, <art id=0432>a postman in a blue
    uniform trimmed with gold, a big bearded face, very like
    Socrates</art>. A violent Republican like Tanguy. A
    man more interesting than most.</p>

    <p>If we prod Russell, perhaps he will take the Gauguin that
    you bought, and if there is no other way of helping Gauguin,
    what should be done?</p>

    <p>When I write him, sending the drawings, it will of course be
    to urge him to make up his mind.</p>

    <p>I shall say to him - Look here, you all like our picture,
    but I believe that we shall see <i>still</i> better work from
    the artist; why don't you do as we do, who have faith in the
    whole man such as he is, and admire everything he does? Then I
    want to add that certainly it is all one to us to give up the
    big picture if necessary, but since Gauguin will often be in
    want of money, it is in <i>his</i> interest that we do not keep
    it until his prices have trebled or quadrupled, a thing which
    we believe will happen.</p>

    <p>If after this Russell likes to make a real definite offer,
    my word&hellip;we shall see! And Gauguin in this case must say
    that if he sold it to you as a friend at such a price, he is
    determined that it should not be sold to another collector at
    that same price. Anyway, let's finish the drawings - I have 8
    and shall do 12 - and let's wait to hear what he says.</p>

    <p>I am very curious to know whether or not you have been able
    to go to Holland. I shall not write any more for the
    moment.</p>

    <p>The change I am going to try to make in my painting is to do
    more figures.</p>

    <p>Altogether it is the only thing in painting that excites me
    to the depths of my soul, and which makes me feel the infinite
    more than anything else. The seventeenth of this month my
    friend the 2<sup>nd</sup> lieutenant of Zouaves is going to
    Paris. He offered to take charge of the parcel I have for you,
    and I think I shall accept; in this way you will get it on the
    eighteenth without having to pay carriage.</p>

    <p>I am writing our sister today; their grief will be
    great.</p>

    <p>Did Bernard's sketches reach you?</p>

    <p>As our sister said, from the moment people are gone, you
    remember only their good moments and their good qualities. But
    the great thing is to try to see these while they are still
    with us. It would be so simple and would account so much for
    the terrible things in life, which now amaze and wound us so,
    if life had yet another hemisphere, invisible it is true, but
    where one lands when one dies. To those who make this
    interesting and solemn journey, our best wishes and
    sympathy.</p>

    <p>If you go to Holland, many kind messages from me to our
    mother and sister.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>This week will be <i>pretty tough</i>, because of my having
    to pay the rent and the model. I hope to do these sketches
    after the studies for you as well. You will see that they have
    something of a Japanese air.</p>

    <p>I must thank you again for yesterday's 50-fr. note, and
    answer your letter.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">It was a good thing to send the paints and canvases, as my
    stock was exhausted all along the line.</label></p>

    <p>About Bing, as for being in a hurry, no, but far from
    breaking off relations with him, we must have another deposit
    of pictures as soon as we can settle up.</p>

    <p>I saw a magnificent and strange effect this evening. A very
    big boat loaded with coal on the Rh&ocirc;ne, moored to the
    Quay. Seen from above it was all shining and wet with a shower;
    the water was yellowish-white and clouded pearl gray; the sky,
    lilac, with an orange streak in the west; the town, violet. On
    the boat some poor workmen in dirty blue and white came and
    went carrying the cargo on shore. It was pure Hokusai. It was
    too late to do it, but one day when that coal boat comes back,
    I must give it a try. I saw it in a railway coalyard, a spot I
    have just found, and where there will be plenty of other things
    to do.</p>

    <p>With a handshake, because if I want to write to Holland too,
    I must make haste.</p>

    <p>I shall have difficulty getting through this week. But I
    hope to get the series of figures going.</p>
