    <p>Letter T24<br>
     Paris, 8 January 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>When I wrote you last time I did so under the impression I
    received from Dr. Peyron's first letter. I am very glad to hear
    that things are not so bad as this letter made me believe, and
    he himself wrote me another letter to tell me that things had
    turned out quite differently from the way he had expected at
    first. In his first letter he gave me to understand that it was
    dangerous for you to go on painting, as the colours were poison
    to you, but he went a little too far, which might have been due
    to his having relied on unverified rumours, as he himself was
    ill at the time. So let's hope that you may continue working as
    you think fit. I suppose Tasset sent you a new consignment of
    paints and canvas. I received your new batch last night; it is
    very remarkable. Do you know, one of the things I like most is
    that <art id=0647>&ldquo;Evening&rdquo; after Millet</art>.
    Copied in such a way, it is no longer a copy. There is tone in
    it, and it is so full of air. It is really very successful.
    <sup>1</sup> As for the other canvases, I very much like the
    one of <art id=0622>those women clambering over the rocks</art>,
    and <art id=0657>the highway with the road menders</art>. I think
    there is more atmosphere in these last works, more distance
    than in the preceding ones. Perhaps this is due to your not
    laying on your paint so thickly everywhere. In one of the rolls
    there was <art id=1531>a superb pen drawing representing a fountain in a
    garden</art>; next Sunday I am going to meet
    Lauzet, who will admire them very much - I am sure of that.</p>

    <p>I agree with you that it might be a good thing for you to
    come here next spring, and then you can decide to go into the
    country after a while if life here doesn't suit you. Here there
    will always be the difficulty that you cannot work in the open
    air, but we shall see, and in any case we shall always be happy
    to have you with us for some time.</p>

    <p>Jo's confinement is expected to take place between the first
    and the fifteenth of February, and after that her mother will
    stay on for about a month, but after her departure the little
    room will be free and at your disposal. Jo is in very good
    health, and does not feel much discomfort on account of her
    pregnancy. The doctor believes that everything will go well.
    When Wil arrived she had such a cold that she had to stay in
    bed this morning, but I hope that if she takes care of herself
    for a day or two, she will be all right again. It was very kind
    of Mr. Salles to go and see you. I wrote him a letter on New
    Year's Day, but I did not venture to ask him to call on you. I
    am very glad that the crisis passed off so quickly this
    time.</p>

    <p>Be of good heart, and kind regards from Jo and Wil; a
    cordial handshake and many thanks for what you sent, which we
    liked very much.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
