  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for the package of canvases, brushes, tobacco
    and chocolate which reached me in good condition.</p>

    <p><label content="health.fatigue">I was very glad of them, for I was feeling a little low
    after working.</label> Also I have been out for several days, working
    in the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>Your last letter, if I remember correctly, was dated May 21.
    I have had no more news of you since, except only that M.
    Peyron told me he had had a letter from you. I hope you are
    well, and your wife too.</p>

    <p>M. Peyron intends to go to Paris to see the exhibition and
    he will pay you a visit then.</p>

    <p>What news can I tell you? - not much. I am working on two
    landscapes (size 30 canvases), views taken in the hills,<art id=0611> one is
    the country that I see from the window of my bedroom. In the
    foreground, a field of wheat ruined and hurled to the ground by
    a storm. A boundary wall and beyond the grey foliage of a few
    olive trees, some huts and the hills. Then at the top of the
    canvas a great white and grey cloud floating in the azure.</art></p>

    <p>It is a landscape of extreme simplicity in colouring too.
    That will make a pendant to the study of the
    <art id=0482>&ldquo;Bedroom&rdquo; which has got damaged.</art>
    When the thing represented is, in point of character,
    absolutely in agreement and one with the manner of representing
    it, isn't it just that which gives a work of art its
    quality?</p>

    <p>That is why, as far as painting goes, a household loaf is
    especially good when it is painted by Chardin.</p>

    <p>Now what makes Egyptian art, for instance, extraordinary -
    isn't it that these serene, calm kings, wise and gentle,
    patient and kind, look as though they could never be other than
    what they are, eternal tillers of the soil, worshippers of the
    sun?</p>

    <p>I should so have liked to have seen an Egyptian house at the
    exhibition constructed by Jules Garnier the architect - painted
    in red, yellow, and blue, with a garden regularly divided into
    beds by rows of bricks - the dwelling place of beings whom we
    know only as mummies or in granite.</p>

    <p>But then to come back to the point, the Egyptian artists,
    having <i>faith</i>, working by feeling and by instinct,
    express all these intangible things - kindness, infinite
    patience, wisdom, serenity - by a few knowing curves and by the
    marvellous proportions. That is to say once more, when the
    thing represented and the manner of representing it agree, the
    thing has style and quality.</p>

    <p>So also the servant girl in Leys's great fresco, once she is
    engraved by Braquemond, becomes a new work of art - or the
    little &ldquo;Reader&rdquo; by Meissonier, when it is
    Jaequemart who engraves it - since the <i>manner</i> of
    <i>engraving</i> is one with the thing represented.</p>

    <p>As I wish to preserve this study of the
    &ldquo;Bedroom,&rdquo; if you would send it back to me, rolled
    up, when they are sending me some canvas again, I will copy
    it.</p>

    <p>At first I had wished to have it recanvassed because I did
    not think I could do it again. But as my brain has grown calmer
    since, I can quite well do it again now.</p>

    <p>The thing is that among the number of things you make, there
    are always some that you felt more or put more into and that
    you want to keep in spite of everything. When I see a picture
    that interests me, I can never help asking myself, &ldquo;In
    what house, room, corner of a room, in whose home would it do
    well, would it be in the right place?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Thus the pictures of Hals, Rembrandt, Van der Meer
    [Vermeer], are only at home in an old Dutch house. Now as to
    the impressionists - once again, if an interior is not complete
    without a work of art, neither is a picture complete if it is
    not in harmony with surroundings originating in and resulting
    from the period in which it was produced. And I do not know if
    the impressionists are better than their time or, on the
    contrary, are not yet so good. In a word, are there minds and
    interiors of homes more important than anything that has been
    expressed by painting? I am inclined to think so.</p>

    <p>I have seen the announcement of a coming exhibition of
    impressionists called Gauguin, Bernard, Anquetin and other
    names. So I am inclined to think that a new sect has again been
    formed, no less infallible than those already existing.</p>

    <p>Was that the exhibition you spoke of? What storms in
    teacups.</p>

    <p>My health is all right, considering; I feel happier here
    with my work than I could be outside. By staying here a good
    long time, I shall have learned regular habits and in the long
    run the result will be more order in my life and less
    susceptibility. That will be so much to the good. Besides, I
    should not have the courage to begin again outside. <label content="psychology.agoraphobia">I went
    once, still accompanied, to the village; the mere sight of
    people and things had such an effect on me that I thought I was
    going to faint and I felt very ill.</label> Face to face with nature it
    is the feeling for work that supports me. But anyway, this is
    to show you that there must have been within me some too
    powerful emotion to upset me like that, and I have no idea what
    can have caused it. I get bored to death sometimes after
    working, and yet I have no desire to begin again. The doctor
    who has just called says that he is not going to Paris for
    several weeks, so do not expect his visit yet. I hope you will
    write me soon.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">It is queer that every time I try to reason with myself to
    get a clear idea of things, why I came here and that after all
    it is only an accident like any other, a terrible dismay and
    horror seizes me and prevents me from thinking. It is true that
    this is tending to diminish slightly, but it also seems to me
    to prove that there is quite definitely something or other
    deranged in my brain, it is astounding to be afraid of nothing
    like this, and to be unable to remember things.</label> Only you may be
    sure I shall do all I can to become active again and perhaps
    useful, at least in the sense that I want to do better pictures
    than before.</p>

    <p>In this country there are many things that often make you
    think of Ruysdael, but the figures of the labourers are
    absent.</p>

    <p>Everywhere at home and at all times of the year you see men,
    women, children and animals at work, and here not a third of
    that, and besides, it is not the genuine worker of the North.
    They seem to work here with languid, clumsy hands, without
    energy. Perhaps this is a wrong idea I have got hold of, not
    belonging to the country, anyhow I hope so. But this makes
    things colder than one would think when reading
    Tartarin<i>,</i> but perhaps he had been exiled with his whole
    family for many long years.</p>

    <p>Above all, write me soon, because your letter is very slow
    in coming; I hope you are well. It is a great consolation to me
    to know that you are not living alone any more.</p>

    <p>If some month or other it should be too difficult to send me
    paint, canvas, etc., then do not send them, for believe me it
    is better to live than to work at art in the abstract.</p>

    <p>And above all your home must not be sad or dull. That first
    and painting after. Then I feel tempted to begin again with the
    simpler colours, the ochres for instance.</p>

    <p>Is a Van Goyen ugly because it is painted entirely in oils
    with very little neutral colour, or a Michel?<art id=0609> The shrubbery
    with the ivy is completely finished.</art> I very
    much want to send it to you as soon as it's dry enough to be
    rolled up.</p>

    <p>With a right good handshake for you and your wife.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
