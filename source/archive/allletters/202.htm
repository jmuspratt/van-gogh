  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today, Saturday, I had a visit from Rappard, and I am glad
    he has been here. He asked after you many times. Among other
    things he saw the drawings I am doing for C. M., and they
    seemed to please him, especially <art id=941>a large one of the court or
    yard where Sien's mother lives</art>. I wish you
    could see that one too, as well as another of <art id=939>a carpenter's
    shop and yard where little figures are busy</art>. It
    is a great deal more complicated as to the perspective than the
    &ldquo;Laan van Meerdervoort&rdquo; I sent you, and it has
    given me trouble enough. You should know that at present I am
    working out-of-doors as early as four o'clock in the morning -
    in the daytime it is too difficult to work in the street
    because of the passers-by and the street urchins; this is also
    the finest moment to see the main outlines, when everything is
    in tone.</p>

    <p>But, brother, it has been a hard fortnight for me. When I
    wrote you about the middle of May, I had only 3 or 3.50
    guilders left after I had paid the baker; <label content="food-and-drink.shortage">and I have had hardly
    anything to eat but dry black bread with some coffee, and Sien
    too.</label> Because we had bought some things for the baby and she had
    been to Leyden, etc.</p>

    <p>Now I have to pay the house rent on the first of June, and I
    have nothing, literally nothing. I hope you will send
    something.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.insomnia">A week ago I felt very faint from continuous sleeplessness.
    Now that I have had some luck with a few drawings and the order
    for C. M. is almost finished,</label> I have new courage and am a
    little calmer.</p>

    <p>But, brother, do write to me soon and deliver me from the
    landlord, for you know he won't be put off.</p>

    <p>Rappard's visit has cheered me up; he seems to work very
    hard.</p>

    <p>I have received 2.50 guilders from him because he saw a tear
    in one of the drawings and said, You must have that
    repaired.</p>

    <p>That's true, I said, but I haven't the money, and the
    drawing must be sent off.</p>

    <p>Then he readily said that he would be pleased to give me it;
    he would have given even more, but I wouldn't take it, and gave
    him a whole lot of wood engravings and a drawing in exchange.
    It was one for C. M., and as it was the best of them all, the
    money to have it repaired was very welcome. That same drawing
    will perhaps be sold afterward for 50 guilders or so, and I
    didn't have the money to have a tear in it repaired.</p>

    <p>Well, I do hope, brother, that you do not think evil of Sien
    and me; she has learned to put up with my disagreeable side,
    and in many ways she understands me better than others. She is
    so willing to help me in everything - I can't tell you how
    useful she is to me. If I go into a rage once in a while either
    about the posing or something else, she knows how to take it,
    and has seen that it soon passes. Similarly, when I worry or
    grumble about something that does not succeed, she often knows
    how to quiet me, and that is something I am not able to do for
    myself.</p>

    <p>And she is very thrifty, and contents herself with a piece
    of black bread without getting disheartened. And I do the same,
    if only we can make both ends meet.</p>

    <p>I hope you have received the drawings I sent I think about
    May 10. There were twenty-five of them in a portfolio; I have
    not heard from you about them.</p>

    <p>I do wish there were a few other people for whom I could do
    something on the same conditions as C. M.'s. <i>And especially
    that C. M. continues to order</i>, for these drawings are much
    better than the first, and by and by I shall do them even
    better. And at that price he certainly isn't getting a bad
    bargain.</p>

    <p>You know how it is: if you do not forsake me because of
    Sien, then I shall be full of courage. And at four in the
    morning I am already at my work, so I shall get through with a
    little sympathy from those who know me. I am longing for your
    letter, a handshake in thought, but do write soon and deliver
    me from the landlord.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
