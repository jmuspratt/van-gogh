  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">Our parents have written to me that you are ill. My boy, I
    wish I could be with you.</label> Last night, I went on foot to
    Richmond; I thought of you all the time, it was a beautiful
    grey evening. You know that every Monday I go to the Methodist
    church at Richmond; yesterday I spoke a few words on the
    subject &ldquo; Nothing pleases me except Jesus, and everything
    pleases me in God.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I would like to be closer to you. Oh! Why are we always at
    odds with each other? Why? I am enclosing a letter from the
    aunts at Zundert - you know that Aunt Bet had an accident. I
    wrote to them that you and I would walk over to Zundert at
    Christmas if possible.</p>

    <p>I have copied a few of the psalms for you; perhaps you would
    like to read them one of these days. <sup>1</sup> Drop me a
    line as soon as you can.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">A week from last Sunday, I made a long trip to London, and
    there I heard about a kind of job which perhaps might do for me
    sometime. In seaport towns like Liverpool and Hull, certain
    preachers are often in need of helpers who know how to speak
    several languages, to work among the sailors, foreigners, and
    visit the sick; some salary is attached to such a position.</label></p>

    <p>I left here early at four o'clock in the morning. It was
    beautiful in the park here, with the avenues of dark elm trees,
    the wet road through it, and a grey rainy sky above it all; in
    the distance there was a thunderstorm. At daybreak I was in
    Hyde Park; the leaves were already falling from the trees and
    the Virginia creeper was beautifully red against the houses,
    and there was a fog. At seven o'clock I was in Kensington, and
    rested a little in a church where I used to go so many Sunday
    mornings.</p>

    <p>In London I visited some friends and also Messrs. Goupil
    &amp; Co.'s gallery, and saw there the drawings that Van
    Iterson had brought with him. It was delightful to see once
    more the Dutch towns and meadows in that way. That picture by
    Artz, the &ldquo;Mill on the Canal,&rdquo; I think very
    fine.</p>

    <p>You also have a beautiful life before you, Theo, keep
    courage.</p>

    <p>Has Van Iterson come back yet? I was so glad to see him
    again. He is bringing you The Wide, Wide World; read it one of
    these days - the first chapters especially are so fine, and so
    true and simple. And read now and then in Longfellow, for
    instance:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I see the lights of the village, gleam through the
    rain and the mist,</p>

    <p>and a feeling of sadness comes o'er me, that my soul cannot
    resist.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>And now, boy, a handshake for you and for Uncle Jan. Adieu,
    keep courage and get better quickly; write soon how you are,
    and send back the aunt's letter then. Poor Aunt Bet, we are
    such old friends. <label content="feelings.nostalgia">O Zundert! Memories of you are sometimes
    almost overpowering. Adieu, boy, may God unite us more and more
    and make us true brothers.</label> Compliments to Uncle Jan and to all
    the Roos family, from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">Paris will be beautiful now in autumn. Every Sunday last
    year Gladwell and I visited many friends and as many churches
    as possible; we went out in the morning and came home late.
    Notre Dame is so splendid in the autumn evening amid the
    chestnut trees. But there is something in Paris more beautiful
    than the autumn and the churches, and that is the poor. I think
    often of many a one over there.</label></p>
