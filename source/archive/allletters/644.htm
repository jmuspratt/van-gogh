    <p>Letter 644<br>
     Auvers-sur-Oise, 24 or 25 June 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter and for the 50-franc note it
    contained. The exchange you have made with Bock is very good,
    and I am very curious to see what he is doing now.</p>

    <p>I hope that Jo is better, as you say that she has been
    indisposed. Certainly you must come here as soon as possible;
    nature is very, very beautiful here and I am longing to see you
    all again.</p>

    <p>M. Peyron wrote to me two days ago, enclosed is his letter.
    I told him that I thought about 10 francs for the servants
    would be enough.</p>

    <p>The canvases have arrived now from there; <art id=0678>the irises</art>
    are quite dry and I hope you will find
    something in it, and there are also <art id=0681>the</art> <art id=0682>roses</art>,
    <art id=0807>a field of wheat</art>, a little
    canvas with mountains and finally <art id=0683>a cypress with a star</art>.</p>

    <p>This week I have done a portrait of a girl of about 16, in
    blue against a blue background, the daughter of the people I
    am lodging with. I have given her <art id=0768>this portrait</art>,
    but I made <art id=0769>a variant of it for you, a size 15 canvas</art>.</p>

    <p>Then I have <art id=0775>a long canvas one meter by just 50 centimeters high,
    of wheat fields</art>, and one which makes a pendant,
    <art id=0773>of undergrowth, lilac poplar trunks and below them
    grass with flowers, pink, yellow, white and various greens</art>.
    Lastly, <art id=0770>an evening effect - two pear trees all
    black against a yellowing sky, with some wheat, and in the
    violet background the ch&acirc;teau surrounded by somber
    greenery</art>.</p>

    <p>The Dutchman works quite diligently, but still has many
    illusions about the originality of his way of seeing
    things. He is doing studies somewhat like those Koning did, a
    little grey, a little green, with a red roof and a whitish
    road.</p>

    <p>What is one to say in a case like this? If he has money,
    then certainly he would do well to paint, but if he has to intrigue
    a lot to make sales, I pity him because he does paintings like
    the others because they buy them at a relatively excessive
    price. He will get there though, if only he works diligently
    every day. But alone or with painters who work little, he won't
    come to much, I think.</p>

    <p>I hope to do the portrait of Mlle. Gachet next week, and
    perhaps I shall have a country girl pose too. <label content="business.sales">I am glad that
    Bock made that exchange with me, for I find that, between friends,
    they have paid a little dearly relatively for the
    other canvas.</label></p>

    <p>A little later on I should very much like to come to Paris
    for several days just to go and look up Quost and Jeannin and
    one or two others. I should very much like you to have a Quost,
    and there might probably be some way of exchanging one. Gachet
    came today to look at the canvases of the Midi. Good
    luck with the little one and a good handshake in thought to you and Jo.</p>
