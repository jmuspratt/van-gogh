  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is already late, but I will not put off acknowledging the
    good receipt of your letter, with enclosed 150 fr.</p>

    <p>By the way, let me begin by answering your question of some
    time ago, about the picture by Franck or Francken at St.
    Andr&eacute;, which I saw today. I think it is a good picture -
    especially fine in sentiment - the sentiment is not very
    Flemish or Rubens-like. It reminds one more of Murillo. The
    colour is warm, in a reddish colour scheme like Jordaens
    sometimes is.</p>

    <p>The shadows in the flesh are very strong, that is what
    Rubens has not, and Jordaens often has, and it gives something
    mysterious to the picture which one must appreciate in that
    school.</p>

    <p>I could not get near enough to analyze the technique close
    up, which would have been well worth while. The head of Christ
    is less conventional than the Flemish painters usually conceive
    it.</p>

    <p>But l imagine I can also do it in that way, and the picture
    did not tell me anything new. And as I am not satisfied with
    what I can do now, and try to make progress - enough - let's
    talk about other pictures. What struck me in that church was a
    sketch by Van Dyck or Rubens (?), &ldquo;The Deposition from
    the Cross,&rdquo; which hung high, but seemed very beautiful to
    me. Much sentiment in the pale corpse - this by the way.</p>

    <p>There is a painted window which I think superb - very, very
    curious. A beach, a green sea with a castle on the rocks, a
    sparkling blue sky of the most beautiful tones of blue,
    greenish, whitish, deeper, higher of tone.</p>

    <p>An enormous three-master, quaint and phantasmal, stands out
    against the sky, diffusion everywhere, light in the dark, dark
    in the light. In the blue a figure of the Holy Virgin, bright
    yellow, white, orange. Higher up the window reappears dark
    green, with black, with fiery red.</p>

    <p>Well - do you remember it? It is very beautiful, and Leys
    would certainly have fallen in love with it, or James Tissot in
    his old style or Thijs Maris.</p>

    <p>I saw some pictures bought for the Mus&eacute;e Moderne, by
    Verhas and Farasyn. Verhas - Ladies mounted on donkeys, and
    fisherboys on the beach. Farasyn - A large picture of the old
    Antwerp Fishmarket.</p>

    <p>Also an Emile Wauters - &ldquo;A Market in Cairo.&rdquo; The
    Verhas looks well, at all events it is a clever picture, daring
    of colour, in a light colour scheme, several beautiful
    combinations, including a figure in orange against light blue,
    light green and white.</p>

    <p>I am working on my portraits all the time, and at last I
    have made two which are decidedly good &ldquo;likenesses&rdquo;
    (<art id=0207>one profile</art> and one three-quarter). That isn't everything, it
    isn't even the most important thing. But it still seems to me
    worth while to aim at it, and perhaps it teaches one to draw.
    Besides, I am getting more and more fond of making portraits.
    Now, for instance, some of those very famous Rubenses -
    &ldquo;Vierge au Perroquet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ &agrave; la
    Paille,&rdquo; etc. I personally prefer to ignore them and look
    rather at that boldly painted portrait of a man - painted with
    such a remarkably firm hand - still sketchy here and there,
    which is hanging not far from Rembrandt's
    &ldquo;Saskia.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In &ldquo;The Deposition from the Cross&rdquo; by Van Dyck,
    the large one, that one high up - there is also a portrait,
    decidedly a portrait - not only of a head, but, thank God, of a
    whole figure, splendid in yellow and lilac, a weeping woman
    bending over, the torso and the legs under the clothes well and
    intimately felt and expressed. Then art is high, when it is
    simple and true.</p>

    <p>And an Ingres, a David, who as painters certainly did not
    always paint beautifully, yet how remarkably interesting even
    they become when, putting their pedantry aside, they forget
    themselves in being true, in reproducing a character like the
    two heads in the Mus&eacute;e Moderne. In short - oh, if only
    one could get the models one wants!!!</p>

    <p>Now just tell me, always supposing that you want to be a
    financier - and I have nothing against it, it is even a thing
    that I highly approve of; but are you quite satisfied with your
    own argument when at the beginning of the year you say, to my
    disappointment, &ldquo;I have so much to pay, you must try to
    manage till the end of the month.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Just listen, this is what I have to say against it, and just
    think over whether I am right or not, at least if there is
    truth in my argument. Am I less than your creditors? - who must
    wait, <i>they or I</i>??? If one of us <i>must</i> wait, which
    belongs to the human possibilities.</p>

    <p>A creditor is <i>no friend</i> to be sure, and I, even if
    you do not know it <i>for sure</i>, at least I am perhaps. And
    do you realize how heavy are my burdens which the work demands
    every day, how difficult it is to get the models, how expensive
    the painting materials are? Do you realize that sometimes it is
    almost literally impossible for me to keep going? and that I
    <i>must</i> paint; that too much depends on my continuing to
    work on here with aplomb <i>immediately</i> and without
    <i>hesitation</i>?</p>

    <p>Too much hesitation might make me fall in a way which I
    could not redress for a long time. My situation is threatened
    from every side, and it can only be saved by working on
    vigorously. The colour bill is like a millstone round my neck,
    and yet I must <i>go on</i>!!!</p>

    <p>I too must keep people waiting, and without mercy; they will
    <i>get their money</i> but they will have to wait, I passed
    this sentence on them - the less credit they give, the longer
    they will have to wait.</p>

    <p>The only way to win at present is with very good work, with
    something that is not ordinary. That higher work costs more in
    money, in trouble, and in strenuous exertion; but now more than
    ever it is the only way.</p>

    <p>What I tell you is simple and clear. Do you understand or
    don't you, that I am perfectly right when I point out to you
    the absolute necessity of having my studio full of very
    <i>good</i> heads if I want to get orders for portraits here?
    That is possible, it is a thing we can see accomplished in the
    end, though on the whole it is not easy to get them done.</p>

    <p>Now, shall we say like impotent dullards and blockheads,
    &ldquo;We cannot do it, we have no money - there is nothing
    doing, I tell you <i>No</i>.&rdquo; This is what we'll say -
    and please let's both say it together, Personally we will
    endure poverty for it, and suffer want as long as it is
    necessary, <i>like one does in a besieged city</i> which one
    does not intend to surrender, but we will show that we are
    <i>men</i>.</p>

    <p>Either one is brave or one is a coward. We must carry things
    to such a height that the public begins to like it. I mean, for
    instance, that the girls will begin to like having their
    portraits painted - I am sure that there are some who want
    them.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">Today I spoke to a photographer's assistant, and asked him
    if he couldn't procure me orders for portraits. He wanted a
    commission for every woman he would bring to me for a portrait.
    I let the matter rest only in so far that I did not promise any
    commission before I knew my man somewhat better. But probably I
    shall see him again soon. And then I shall see if I can do
    anything with him directly, or if I shall go and speak to his
    boss; but sometimes the employee is better, it all depends. I
    told him now that I did not know him, and that I should like to
    see what he could do, but that it was a risk for me, because a
    portrait always entails expenses for me.</label></p>

    <p>Well, I shall see later on; but the most urgent thing is
    that I have some fine heads to show. I must also try to make
    acquaintances among the prostitutes, which is not a pleasant
    task when one has a purse with very little in it. I can assure
    you it is no pleasure then.</p>

    <p>But it is not taking trouble that I am afraid of But I
    believe that you have so accustomed yourself to thinking it all
    right that I am always to be neglected that you forget too
    easily how I have not had my due for so many years already.</p>

    <p>And that my wanting to enlarge my business is not only good
    for me, but for you too, because only in that way can I earn
    something.</p>

    <p>And now another thing. Theoretically at least you say that
    it is necessary to be well dressed and so on for the occasions
    when one has to go and see people, etc. Well, the time has come
    when it is necessary even for me, who, as you know, am not keen
    on such things. Are such things necessary or not??? Does
    anything depend on it - Yes or No?</p>

    <p>Well, given that period of having to break through, the
    monthly allowance is too small for me to possibly make both
    ends meet.</p>

    <p>You are thrifty yourself, you understand what is
    <i>absolutely</i> needed. And I ask you, can one do what is
    absolutely necessary with what remains for one's own use after
    paying for painting materials, models, and rent? If I had some
    friends, if I were a little known<b>,</b> yes, then it would be
    easier; but I have no friends, and my job is to try and make
    them.</p>

    <p>But do not let me forget to thank you for sending the second
    volume of de Goncourt's book. It is a delightful thing to be
    able to study that period - from which <i>so much can be
    learned</i> by - to use the expression - <i>notre fin du
    si&egrave;cle</i> in which we live.</p>

    <p>I cannot tell you how glad I am that I went to Antwerp, and
    how many remarkable things there are here for me, who has been
    out of it all for so long.</p>

    <p>How glad I am to see the city again, much as I like the
    peasants in the country. How the bringing together of contrasts
    gives me new ideas - the contrasts between the <i>absolute
    quiet of the country and the bustle here</i>. I needed it
    badly.</p>

    <p>Ah, if only I could bring home to you how much more
    satisfaction you yourself might find, how much more you would
    be a friend to me if, instead of that frigid and unkind
    slighting and keeping me at a distance (only think of last
    summer, and the preceding summers!), you could at long last
    gain the conviction that this is not the right way.</p>

    <p>Always to be in a state of exile, forever having to make
    great efforts, always half measures But never mind - the family
    stranger than strangers is one fact - and being through with
    Holland is a second fact. <i>It is quite a relief</i>.</p>

    <p>That is my only feeling, and yet I have been so deeply
    attached to it all that at first the estrangement drove me
    crazy. But I have looked over the cards too narrowly to let
    myself hesitate now. And I have got my self-confidence and my
    serenity back. The secret of that clique - Delaroche-esqueness,
    <i>mediocrity</i>. Retrogression - I abhor it!</p>

    <p>As far as you are concerned - you are still dangling between
    the two parties, and I have always told you that your character
    will have to set in a definite mold - that you will have to go
    through an inner struggle and possibly a social struggle for
    the sake of your position, both more serious than you ever went
    through in the past.</p>

    <p>I know you think this merciless to those at home. And yet I
    tell you that at times <i>Father himself felt vaguely</i> that
    he had made a mistake and had taken the wrong side. But he
    tried to reconcile irreconcilable things, and...he had not as
    much firmness of character as he seemed to have, and as I
    thought him to have when I was a boy and even later. Oh
    well&hellip;</p>

    <p>As to the &ldquo;Tassaert Exhibition,&rdquo; if ever a man
    was wronged, it is he. To mention another at the same time - I
    do not wait for exhibitions to form an opinion about painters -
    <i>Chaplin</i> will also have to be recognized. As to
    Tassaert's colour, he is a harmonist, and his work, painted
    almost in one tone, is beautiful because of the modelling,
    because of the delicate intuition of the female forms, because
    of something passionate in the expressions - and I think he
    belongs to the race of the Greuzes and Prudhons - better, more
    modern, more serious in sentiment than Greuze. Chaplin is a
    greater colourist than he.</p>

    <p>And I think it rather a pity that Tassaert, who painted
    human flesh so well, did not put more glow and life into the
    colour. But he is certainly better than Scheffer and Delaroche
    and Dubuffe and G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, who are so little
    <i>painters</i>.</p>

    <p>What a great pity it is that a fellow like
    G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, who painted &ldquo;The Prisoner&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;The Russian Camp&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Syrian
    Shepherds,&rdquo; is so cold and sterile. They will also have
    to recognize Isabey, Ziem too, these two are real
    <i>painters</i>, and that is what is needed in painting after
    all.</p>

    <p>I must finish. What colour is in a picture, enthusiasm is in
    life, therefore - it is no little thing to try to keep that
    enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>Because of the models this month I think I shall go and see
    Verlat, who is the director of the academy here - and I must
    see what the conditions are, and if one could work there from
    the nude. I shall take a portrait and some drawings with me
    then.</p>

    <p>I have an immense longing to improve my knowledge of the
    nude. I have seen a large bronze group by Lambeau - two figures
    - a man embracing a woman, <i>superb</i>. Something like Paul
    Dubois, for instance, or in short the first-class people. It
    has been bought for the museum.</p>

    <p>I often envy the sculptors. But it is somewhat the same
    everywhere. I ought to be able to earn more in order to be able
    to work more.</p>

    <p>I must also tell you that in view of that longing to study
    the figure, in case I should not succeed here, I should rather
    go farther away than go back to Holland before I had worked for
    a time at some studio. That &ldquo;farther&rdquo; might perhaps
    be Paris, without any hesitation.</p>

    <p>You may be of the opinion that I am an impossible character
    - but that's absolutely <i>your own</i> business. For instance,
    I <i>need not</i> care, and <i>I am not going to</i>. I know
    that your business routine induces you again and again to lapse
    into the old evil with regard to me. What I seek is so
    straightforward that in the end you cannot but give in. So
    let's conclude by saying, The sooner the better.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>As to the end of the month - I beg you most kindly but
    urgently - let one of your creditors wait, i.e. at least for 50
    fr. (they can stand it, do not be afraid), but please do not
    let it be me, for <i>even then</i> it will still be tough for
    me.</p>
