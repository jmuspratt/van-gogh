  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have wondered a little at not having heard from you yet.
    You will say that you have been too busy to think of it, and of
    course I understand this.</p>

    <p>It is late in the evening, but I want to tell you once more
    how sincerely I hope that in the future our correspondence will
    become somewhat more animated than it has been of late.</p>

    <p>Enclosed you will find two scratches of a few studies I
    made, while at the same time <art id=0078>I am again working on those
    peasants around the dish of potatoes</art>. I have
    just come home from this cottage and have been working at it by
    lamplight, though I began it by daylight this time.</p>

    <p><?showImage("481_V-T_3990");?>
     This is what the composition looks like.</p>

    <p>I painted it on a rather large canvas, and as the sketch is
    now, I think there is some life in it.</p>

    <p>Yet I am sure C. M., for instance would find fault with the
    drawing, etc. Do know what a positive argument against that is?
    That the beautiful effects of in nature demand a very quick
    hand in drawing.</p>

    <p>Now I know quite well that the great masters, especially in
    the period of their ripest experience, knew both how to be
    elaborate in the finishing and at the same time to keep a thing
    full of life. But certainly that will be beyond my power for
    the present At the point I am now, however, I see a chance of
    giving a true impression of what I see.</p>

    <p>Not always literally exact or rather never exact, for one
    sees nature through one's own temperament</p>

    <p>The advice I want to give, you know, is the following: Don't
    let the time slip by; help me to work as much as possible, and
    from now on keep all the studies together.</p>

    <p>I do not like to sign any of them yet, for I do not want
    them to circulate as pictures, which one would have to buy up
    again later when one had some reputation. But it will be a good
    thing if you show them, for you will see that someday we shall
    find somebody who wants to do the same thing I propose to you
    now, namely make a collection of studies.</p>

    <p>I intend to go out regularly every morning and to attack the
    very first thing I see people do, either in the field or at
    home, which in fact I am already doing now.</p>

    <p>You are looking for new ideas for the art trade; the idea of
    being <i>kind</i> to the art lovers is not new, but it is one
    that <i>never gets old</i>.</p>

    <p>Like that of guaranteeing a purchase. And I ask you, isn't
    it better for an art lover to possess from one painter, for
    instance, twenty quite different sketches at the same price
    which he in all fairness would have to pay for <i>one</i>
    finished picture which, as a saleable article, had its value on
    the market? If I were in your place, as you know so many young
    painters who haven't a reputation yet, I would try to bring
    <i>painted studies</i> on the market, not as pictures, but
    mounted in some way on gilt Bristol, for instance, or black, or
    deep red.</p>

    <p>Just now I mentioned giving a guarantee.</p>

    <p>Not <i>all</i> painters make a lot of studies - but many do,
    and especially the young ones must do so as much as possible,
    mustn't they? He who possesses a painter's studies may always
    be sure (at least it seems that way to me) that there is a bond
    between the painter and himself which cannot easily be broken
    at a whim.</p>

    <p>There are people, as you know, who support painters during
    the time when they do not yet earn anything, very well!</p>

    <p>But how often doesn't it happen that it ends miserably,
    wretchedly, for both parties, partly because the protector is
    annoyed about the money, which is or at least seems quite
    thrown away, whereas, on the other hand, the painter feels
    entitled to more confidence, more patience and interest than is
    given him? But in most cases the misunderstandings arise from
    carelessness on both sides.</p>

    <p>I hope this will not be the case between us.</p>

    <p>And I hope that by and by my studies will give you some new
    courage. Neither you nor I are contemporaries of that race
    which Gigoux, in that book you sent me, rightly calls
    &ldquo;Les vaillants.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But it seems to me right after all to keep the enthusiasm of
    those days in the present time, for it is often true that
    fortune favours the bold, and whatever may be true about
    fortune or &ldquo;la joie (?) de vivre,&rdquo; as it is called,
    one must work and dare if one really wants to live.</p>

    <p>I repeat, let us paint as much as we can and be productive,
    <i>and, with all our faults and qualities, be ourselves</i>; I
    say <i>us</i>, because the money from you, which I know costs
    you trouble enough to get for me, gives you the right, if there
    is some good in my work, to consider half of it your own
    creation.</p>

    <p>Try to speak to somebody at Le Chat Noir and ask them if
    they want a sketch of those potato eaters, and if so, of what
    size, for it's all the same to me. Good-by, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
