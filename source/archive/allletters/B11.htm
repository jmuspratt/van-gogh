    <p>My dear friend Bernard,</p>

    <p>I've just sent you another 9 sketches after painted studies.
    <art id=1430></art><art id=1435></art><art id=1444></art><art id=1442></art>
    <art id=1426></art><art id=1481></art><art id=1491></art><art id=1488></art><art id=1554></art>
    So you'll see subjects from the scenery that inspires old man
    C&eacute;zanne, because the Crau near Aix is almost the same as
    the countryside round Tarascon or the Crau here. The Camargue
    is even plainer, for often there is nothing, nothing, other
    than poor soil and tamarisk bushes and the coarse grass that is
    to these bare pastures what esparto grass is to the desert.</p>

    <p>Knowing how keen you are on C&eacute;zanne, I thought you
    might like these sketches of Provence; not that a drawing of
    mine and one by C&eacute;zanne have much in common. No, indeed,
    any more than Monticelli and I! But I too love the countryside
    they have loved so much, and for the same reasons, the colour
    and the logical composition.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">My dear friend Bernard, by <i>collaboration</i> I did not
    mean to say that I think two or more painters would have to
    work on the same pictures. What I was driving at was paintings
    that differ from one another yet go together and complement one
    another.</p>

    <p>Just take the Italian primitives or the German primitives or
    the Dutch school or the real Italians, in short, take the whole
    of the art of painting!</p>

    <p>Whether they want it or not, their work forms a
    &ldquo;group,&rdquo; a &ldquo;series.&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>Well, now, at present the impressionists also form a group,
    despite all their disastrous civil wars, in which both sides
    have been trying to get at each other's throats with a
    dedication they would have done better to reserve for other
    ends.</p>

    <p>In our northern school, you have Rembrandt, who heads that
    school because his influence may be seen in anyone who comes to
    know him more closely. Thus we find Paulus Potter painting
    rutting and excited animals in equally exciting landscapes - in
    a thunderstorm, in the sunshine, in the melancholy of autumn -
    while that selfsame Paulus Potter, before he came to know
    Rembrandt, was rather dry and over-fussy.</p>

    <p>Here are two people, Rembrandt and Potter, who belong
    together like brothers, and even though Rembrandt probably
    never touched a picture by Potter with his brush, that doesn't
    alter the fact that Potter and Ruysdael owe him all that is
    best in them - the thing that moves us so deeply when we have
    learned how to look at a corner of old Holland as if through
    their temperament.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the material problems of the painter's life make
    it desirable that painters should collaborate and unite (much
    as they did in the days of the Guilds of St. Luke). If only
    they would ensure their material well-being, and love one
    another like friends instead of making one another's life hell,
    painters would be happier, and in any case less ridiculous,
    less foolish and less culpable.</p>

    <p>However, I shan't labour the point, because I realize that
    life carries us along so fast that we haven't the time to talk
    and to work as well. That is the reason why, with unity still a
    long way off, we are now sailing the trackless deep in our
    frail little boats, all alone on the high seas of our time.</p>

    <p>Is it a renaissance? Is it a decline? We cannot judge,
    because we are too close to it not to be deceived by distorted
    perspectives. Contemporary events, our setbacks and successes,
    probably assume exaggerated proportions in our eyes.</p>

    <p>A hearty handshake from me and I hope to hear something from
    you soon.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
