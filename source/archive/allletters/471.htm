  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I was tremendously glad to get your letter, thank you for
    it, and for the 50-Fr. note.</p>

    <p>Congratulations on Tersteeg's letter, I think it is
    absolutely satisfactory.</p>

    <p>I am certain there is nothing to be hurt about in his
    silence with regard to me; besides, he could count on your
    giving me his letter to read. Then too, it is much simpler for
    him to have only you to write to, and as far as I am concerned,
    unless he thinks my stuff hopelessly bad, you'll see that he'll
    write me a line as soon as he has seen what I've done, I tell
    you again, I am more pleased with this simple and well meaning
    answer of his than I can say. You will have noticed that he
    says he is prepared to buy a good Monticelli for his own
    collection.</p>

    <p>What if you were to say to him that in our collection we
    have a bunch of flowers which is a better piece of painting and
    more beautiful than one by Diaz? That Monticelli sometimes made
    a bunch of flowers an excuse for gathering together in a single
    panel the whole range of his richest and most perfectly
    balanced tones. And that you must go straight to Delacroix to
    find anything equal to his orchestration of colours.</p>

    <p>Also that - I am speaking of picture in the Delarebeyrettes
    - we actually know of another flower-piece, very good in
    quality and reasonable in price, and that we think it
    altogether superior to the Monticelli figure paintings which
    are to be seen everywhere now, and which belong to his period
    of decadence.</p>

    <p>I hope that you will send him Gauguin's fine marine. But how
    glad I am that Tersteeg should have written like this!</p>

    <p>When you are writing him, you might mention Russell. When I
    write Russell myself, I shall talk to him about his pictures
    and ask him to exchange one with me, because we shall want to
    mention his name and show his pictures as soon as the question
    of the modern renaissance school comes up.</p>

    <p>I have just finished a <art id=0555>group of apricot trees in bloom in a
    little orchard of fresh green</art>. I've had a
    setback with <art id=0544>the sunset with figures and a bridge that I spoke
    of to Bernard</art>. The bad weather prevented my working on the
    spot, and I've completely ruined it by trying to finish it at
    home. However, I at once began the same<art id=0400> subject again
    on another canvas, but, as the weather was quite
    different, in gray tones and without figures</art>.</p>

    <p>It would not be a bad idea for you to send Tersteeg one of
    my studies: would you say <art id=0303>the bridge at Clichy
    with the yellow sky and two houses reflected in the water</art>? - or
    the butterflies or the field of poppies, for that matter,
    though I hope to do better here.</p>

    <p>.<?showImage("569_V-T_4710");?>
    </p>

    <p>If you think so too, you might tell Tersteeg that I myself
    thought I should have a greater chance of selling in Holland
    with nature studies of the Midi, and that when Tersteeg comes
    to Paris in May, he will find a consignment of several subjects
    from here.</p>

    <p>Thank you very much too for all the steps you have taken
    toward the exhibition of the Independents. On the whole I'm
    very glad that they've been put with the other
    impressionists.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">But though it doesn't matter in the least this time, in the
    future my name ought to be put in the catalogue as I sign it on
    the canvas, namely Vincent and not Van Gogh, for the simple
    reason that they do not know how to pronounce the latter name
    here.</label></p>

    <p>I return to you enclosed Tersteeg's and Russell's letters.
    It might perhaps be interesting to keep the artists'
    correspondence. It would not be a bad idea to add the little
    head of the Breton woman by friend Bernard to your consignment.
    He must be shown that all the impressionists are good, and
    their work very varied.</p>

    <p>I think our friend Reid regrets having fallen out with us,
    but unfortunately it's quite impossible to offer him the same
    advantages again, or to try to let him have the pictures on
    commission. It is not enough to be fond of pictures, and he
    seems to me to have no feeling for artists. If he changes as
    much as all that, it will not be overnight.</p>

    <p>Tersteeg was a personal friend of Mauve's and of many
    others, and there is something about him which convinces
    collectors. You will find that knowing people is what gives
    conviction.</p>

    <p>I'll write again in a few days, but I wanted to congratulate
    you at once on the rebirth of your business relations in
    Holland.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Paris doesn't pay: I'd be sorry to see the Seurats in a
    provincial museum or in a cellar, those pictures ought to stay
    in living hands - if only Tersteeg would&hellip;If three
    permanent exhibitions are started, there must be one great
    Seurat in Paris, one in London, and one in Marseilles.</p>
