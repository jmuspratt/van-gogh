  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Few things have given me so much pleasure recently as
    hearing things from home which to a certain extent set my mind
    at ease about their feelings toward me. Sien came to tell me
    that a parcel had been delivered to the studio, and I told her
    to go and open it and see what was in it, and in case there was
    a letter, to bring it with her; so I learned that they had sent
    a whole package of things, underwear and outer clothing and
    cigars, and there was also 10 guilders enclosed in the letter.
    I cannot tell you how it touched me, it is much more than I
    expected; but they do not know everything yet.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I am just weak and feeble, Theo, and I need absolute,
    absolute rest to recover, so everything that makes for peace is
    welcome. But I felt much worse than now before I was lying
    here, and please bear in mind that it is not at all serious,
    and only a short period of treatment will make me well again.</label> I
    wanted to tell you the news about Father and Mother
    immediately, because I thought it would please you, too.</p>

    <p>Sien will probably go next Monday, for I think she is better
    off in the hospital now; she will be admitted about the middle
    of June. She wanted to stay here for me, but I wouldn't allow
    it.</p>

    <p>I have my books on perspective here, and a few volumes of
    Dickens, including Edwin Drood<i>;</i> there is perspective in
    Dickens, too. Good God, what an artist! There's no one like
    him.</p>

    <p>I hope my having to take a rest will have a good effect on
    my drawings; sometimes one gets a better view of things when
    one does not work on them for a while - then when one sees them
    again, they seem fresh and new.</p>

    <p>The view from the window of the ward is splendid: yards on
    the canal, with the barges loaded with potatoes, rear view of
    houses that are being pulled down by workmen, part of a garden;
    and on the next, more distant, plane the Quay with its rows of
    trees and street lamps, a very complicated little almshouse
    with little gardens connected to it; and finally, all the
    roofs. The whole is a bird's-eye view which, especially in the
    evenings and in the mornings, is mysterious because of the
    light's effect, for instance, like a Ruysdael or Van der Meer.
    But I may not and cannot draw it as long as I am so weak. But
    though I'm forbidden to get out of bed, I cannot refrain from
    getting up to look at it every evening.</p>

    <p>Write me soon; wasn't that parcel from home a surprise? -
    and especially coming at a time like this, it made me more than
    happy.</p>

    <p>The rest cure does me good and makes me so much calmer, and
    takes away that nervousness which has troubled me so much
    recently. And the ward here is no less interesting to me than
    the third-class waiting room. But I may not and cannot draw
    yet. Adieu, I hope you will find time to write to me, believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I thought it so nice that this came from home, I wanted to
    let you know at once. Of course I do not need any more clothes
    now. I wrote home to thank them, and to tell them I was here.
    You know the address is-City Hospital-4 Class-Ward 6-No. 9.
    Brouwersgracht.</p>
