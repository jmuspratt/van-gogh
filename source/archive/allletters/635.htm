    <p>My dear Theo and dear Jo,</p>

    <p>After having made Jo's acquaintance, henceforth it will be
    difficult for me to write only to Theo, but Jo will allow me,
    I hope, to write in French, because after two
    years in the Midi, I really think that I shall say what I have
    to say more clearly this way.<br>
     Auvers is quite beautiful, among other things a lot of old
    thatched roofs, which are getting rare. So I should hope that
    by settling down to do some canvases of this there would be a
    chance of recovering the expenses of my stay - for really it is
    profoundly beautiful, it is the real country, characteristic
    and picturesque.<br>
     <label content="psychology.neurological">I have seen Dr. Gachet, who made the
    impression on me of being rather eccentric, but his experience as a doctor must keep him
    balanced while fighting the nervous trouble from which he
    certainly seems to me to be suffering at least as seriously as
    I.</label><br>
     He piloted me to an inn where they asked 6 francs a day. All by
    myself I found one where I will pay 3.50 fr. a day.<br>
     And until further notice I think I will stay there.
    When I have done some studies, I shall see if it would be
    better to move, but it seems unfair to me, when you are willing
    and able to pay and work like any other labourer, to have to
    pay almost double because you work at painting. Anyway, I am
    going to the inn at 3.50 first.<br>
     Probably you will see Doctor Gachet this week - he has a very
    fine Pissarro, winter with a red house in the snow, and two
    fine bouquets by C&eacute;zanne.<br>
     Also another C&eacute;zanne, of the village. And I in my
    turn will gladly, very gladly, do a bit of brushwork here.<br>
     I told Dr. Gachet that for 4 francs a day I should think the
    inn he had shown me preferable, but that 6 was 2 francs too
    much, considering the expenses that I have. It was useless for him
    to say that I should be quieter there, enough is enough.<br>
     His house is full of black antiques, black, black, black,
    except for the impressionist pictures mentioned. Nevertheless, he is
    a stange fellow. The impression he made on me
    was not unfavorable. When he spoke of Belgium and
    the days of the old painters, his grief-hardened face became
    smiling again, and I really think that I shall go on being
    friends with him and that I shall do his portrait.<br>
     Then he said that I must work boldly on, and not think at all
    of what went wrong with me.<br>
    <label content="psychology.agoraphobia"> In Paris I felt very strongly that all the noise there was not
    for me.</label><br>
     I am so glad to have seen Jo and the little one and your
    apartment, which is certainly better than the other one.<br>
     Wishing you good luck and health and hoping to see you
    again soon, good handshakes,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
