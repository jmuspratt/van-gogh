    <p>Letter 425<br>
     Nuenen c. 4 September 1885</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I should have let you know before that I received you letter
    and enclosed 150 fr. in good order.</p>

    <p>I have also received the September Lhermitte, it is
    splendid. <label content="art.influences">You write about the Poussins in the Louvre; I am very
    fond of Poussin. But how long - too long - is it since I saw
    those paintings? You cannot imagine what a longing I have to
    see pictures. I shall have to satisfy it anyhow. For the very
    reason that I hope to go on trying to find buyers for my own
    work, I think it will be a good thing for me to take a trip now
    and then.</p>

    <p>Longing most of all for Rembrandt and Frans Hals, this week
    I shall go to the museum in Amsterdam for a day with a friend
    of mine from Eindhoven, some of whose studies I showed you.</label></p>

    <p>If I can enter into connections for my own work, I shall not
    fail to do so, and I firmly believe that with perseverance I
    shall win.</p>

    <p>Speaking of my work, I had already written you that I have
    been very busy painting still lifes lately, and I like it
    immensely. I shall send you some.</p>

    <p>I know, they are hard to sell, but it is damned useful, and
    I shall continue to paint them this winter.</p>

    <p>You will receive <art id=0107>a big still life of potatoes, in which I
    tried to get <i>corps</i>, I mean, to express the material in
    such a way that they become heavy, solid lumps - which would
    hurt you if they were thrown at you, for instance</art>.</p>

    <p>Well, you'll see for yourself.</p>

    <p>That affair with the priest has not given me any more
    trouble. But of course there will always be God-fearing natives
    in the village who will persist in suspecting me, for one thing
    is sure, namely that the priest would only too gladly throw the
    whole blame of that affair on me. However, as I am quite
    innocent, the gossip from that quarter leaves me perfectly
    indifferent; as long as they don't bother me in my painting. I
    don't take any notice of it whatever. With the peasants to whom
    the accident happened, where I often used to paint, I have
    remained on good terms, and I am as welcome in their home as I
    used to be. I am now busy painting still lifes of my <art id=0112>birds'
    nests</art>, <art id=0111>four of which are finished</art>; I think some people who are
    <art id=0108>good observers of nature </art>might like them because of <art id=0110>the colours
    of the moss</art>, the <art id=0109>dry leaves and the grasses</art>.</p>

    <p>I will write you again at the end of the week, after my trip
    to Amsterdam.</p>

    <p>As next month I shall have to pay the rent again, I can
    hardly afford the expense. But it must be done. So you will
    soon hear again.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I firmly believe that my work will improve by my seeing more
    pictures, because when I see a picture, I can analyze how it is
    done. As to Poussin, he is a painter and a thinker who always
    gives inspiration, in whose pictures all reality is at the same
    time symbolic. In the work of Millet, of Lhermitte, all reality
    is also at the same time symbolic. They are different from what
    are called realists.</p>

    &ldquo;When winter comes (when I have more time for it) I shall
    make more drawings of this kind of thing. <i>La nich&eacute;e
    et les nids</i> [the nestlings and the nests], I feel deeply
    for them - especially <i>people's</i> nests, those huts on the
    heath and their inhabitants.]</p>
