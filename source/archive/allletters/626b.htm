  <body>
    <p>My dear Mr. Ginoux,</p>

    <p>I should certainly have preferred to call on you in person
    to inquire after your patient's health, as I had hoped to be
    able to go and see you again one of these days. <label content="health.general">But as I myself
    have been indisposed during the past week,</label> I am obliged to
    write you for news.</p>

    <p>Please do not fail to let me know how she is, for I should
    be uneasy if I did not receive your news by return mail.</p>

    <p>Only the other day I had a letter from Mr. Paul [Gauguin],
    and it is possible that I shall go and see him soon, for I am
    longing to make the acquaintance of my brother's little boy,
    who was born a short time ago, safe and sound fortunately. So
    for myself I am quite glad that all goes well with me,
    especially as my work is not progressing too badly, and because
    there have been articles on my pictures published
    simultaneously in Belgium and in Paris, where I had them
    exhibited, in which they speak far better of them than I myself
    could have wished.</p>

    <p>I am expecting a visit from a Marseilles painter one of
    these days, which is another reason why I don't know exactly
    when I shall be able to go and see you; as for myself, the
    latest attack has now passed off, and I am again working as
    usual.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I hope you will not leave me pining for an answer.
    All the best to you and Mrs. Ginoux, and my good wishes for her
    speedy recovery.</p>

    <p>A handshake for you two and for my other friends, and
    believe me,</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Vincent v. Gogh</p>
  </body>
