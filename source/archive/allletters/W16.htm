    <p>W16 <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Saint-R&eacute;my, c. 10 December 1889</p>

    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for writing me a letter. As for me, I should be
    highly pleased if you went to stay with Theo next January - as
    it is not impossible that I too shall go to Paris, so that we
    might meet.</p>

    <p>I am greatly interested in your description of your and
    Mother's abode, and it is a certain fact that this moving was a
    wise and well-considered thing to do. I should most assuredly
    be charmed to see it - that quay, where people came to wash the
    red and green wool, and those barges moored alongside, and that
    factory with its lighted windows at night. These are effects
    which I should like to paint.</p>

    <p>And the garden with that mulberry tree trained on
    latticework. As for mulberry trees, there are a good many of
    them here. <art id=0637>I painted one some time ago, when its dense foliage
    was of a magnificent yellow colour against a very blue sky. On
    a white stony field with the sunshine from behind</art>.</p>

    <p>I think I shall send to Brussels: <art id=0456>sunflowers</art>,
    <art id=0495>a quite red vine in autumn</art>, <art id=0516>an orchard
    in bloom</art>, <art id=0609>tree trunks covered with ivy</art>,
    and finally <art id=0737>a field of young wheat at sunrise</art>.
    I am working on the latter canvas at the moment; it
    is (along with the orchard in bloom, which Theo liked, he said)
    the most delicate thing I have painted yet. The fleeing lines
    of the furrows rise high into the picture toward the distant
    hills of a violet hue. The earth is pink and violet, but
    marbled with the yellow-green of the wheat. The sky in the
    background with a sun in it is pale citron yellow and pink.</p>

    <p>Do not imagine that it is less cold here than in Holland.
    The winter has only just started, and we shall have it until
    the end of March. Only less rain than in Holland, an unbearably
    harassing wind which is very cold, and dry and clear but severe
    spells of cold weather, although the sun has more power, and
    the sky is very blue.</p>

    <p>I think that within a short time you will receive the
    canvases I promised you. <label content="Theo.health">What I think very unfortunate is what
    you write about my having said that Theo is still coughing -
    damn it - this does not please me at all - nevertheless I think
    that it will improve as soon as he is a father</label>. <sup>3</sup> I
    wish he had my health, by which I mean that I myself always
    have plenty of fresh air,<label content="Theo.work"> whereas he is always, always sitting
    in his office with his head so full of bother. Indeed, they are
    evil-minded fellows at Boussod's, too proud and tyrannical.</label></p>

    <p>I am working on twelve large canvases, especially olive
    orchards, <art id=0707>one of which has a sky that is entirely pink</art>, another
    one <art id=0586>with a green and orange sky</art>, and <art id=0710>a third one with a big
    yellow sun</art>.</p>

    <p>Moreover, <art id=0652>tall weather-beaten fir trees against a red
    evening sky</art>.</p>

    <p>I just received a very good letter from Theo; he says that
    he and Jo are in good health, and he also says that you may
    come to stay with them. So let us hope that within a short time
    his health will be fully re-established - with him it is to a
    great degree his state of mind which influences all the
    rest.</p>

    <p>At present a great number of painters who spent the winter
    in the country are returning to Paris. You ask me who Bernard
    is - he is a young painter - he is certainly not older than
    twenty - very original. He is trying to do elegant modern
    figures in the manner of the ancient Greek and Egyptian art, a
    gracefulness in the expressive motions, a charm in consequence
    of his daring colours.</p>

    <p>I saw <art id=retonnes>a picture of his of a Sunday afternoon in Brittany,
    Breton peasant women, children, peasants, dogs strolling about
    in a very green meadow; the clothes are black and red, the
    women's caps white. But in this crowd there are also two
    ladies, the one dressed in red, the other in bottle green; they
    make it a very modern thing.</art></p>

    <p>Ask Theo to show you <art id=1422>the watercolour that
    I made after the picture</art>; it is so original that I wanted to
    have a copy of it. Now you say you seem to remember that you
    have seen rocks painted by him; he had done many of them, and
    also cliffs and beaches in Brittany.</p>

    <p>He has also painted landscapes and figures of the outskirts
    of Paris. Theo has an excellent thing of his, which I exchanged
    with Bernard for a canvas of mine. It is the portrait of his
    grandmother, very old, blind in one eye; the background is the
    wall of a room covered with chocolate-coloured wallpaper, and a
    completely white bed. The other day he sent me six photographs
    of pictures he has done this year, and by way of contrast they
    are bizarre and highly debatable Biblical subjects - but by
    this you see that he is an original, a seeker who tries
    everything. They are like medieval tapestry, stiff and very
    brightly coloured figures.</p>

    <p>However, I admire this only moderately, for the English
    Pre-Raphaelites have done such things more seriously and
    conscientiously, and with more ability and logic. Of these I
    suppose you know Millais, who did &ldquo;The Huguenot&rdquo;
    and an engraving, &ldquo;The Light of the World.&rdquo; If you
    should like it, I shall tell Bernard to paint your portrait
    while you are in Paris. He will certainly do it, and I assure
    you that he will do it well. I won't say anything about it to
    him, in case you shouldn't think it pleasant, but as for me I
    should very much like him to do it. And I should exchange it
    for a picture of mine, which he wants me to exchange.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">While I was writing this letter I got up to order to put a
    few brush strokes on a canvas I'm working on - the very picture
    of those weather-beaten fir trees against a red, orange, yellow
    sky - it was very fresh yesterday - the tones pure and
    brilliant - well, I don't know what thoughts came into my head
    while I was writing, but when I looked at my canvas I told
    myself it was not right. Then I took a colour that was there on
    the palette, a dull dirty white, which you get by mixing white,
    green and a little carmine. I daubed this greenish tone all
    over the sky, and behold, at a distance it softens the tones,
    whereas one would think that one would spoil and besmirch the
    painting.</label> Don't misfortune and disease do the same thing to us
    and to our health; and if fate ordains that we be unfortunate
    or sick, are we not in that case worth more than if we were
    serene and healthy according to our own vague ideas and desires
    with regard to possible happiness? I don't know&hellip;</p>

    <p>When I compare them with others, some of my pictures
    certainly show traces of having been painted by a sick man, and
    I assure you that I don't do this on purpose. It's against my
    conscious will that all my calculations end in broken tones.
    Bernard has parents who give him shelter and food with very bad
    grace, and continually reproach him because he does not earn
    money. So every now and then his home is hell, but as far as I
    know there is nobody who works so inexpensively. Well, he is a
    nice boy, very Parisian, very elegant. He should have gone into
    the army this year, but they granted him a respite until next
    year on account of his health.</p>

    <p>I still have work to do, hope to see you soon, I embrace you
    thought.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent.</p>

    tuberculosis.</p>
