    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>During the journey I thought of you at least as much as I did
    of the new country that I was seeing.</p>

    <p>Only I told myself that maybe later on you will often
    come here yourself.<label content="health.general"> It seems to me almost impossible to be able to
    work in Paris unless one has a refuge where one
    can recuperate and regain one's tranquillity and poise.
    Without that, one would get hopelessly exhausted.</label></p>

    <p>Now I'll begin by telling you that there's at least 60
    centimeters of fallen snow everywhere, and it is still falling.</p>

    <p>Arles doesn't seem any bigger than Breda or Mons.</p>

    <p>Before arriving at Tarascon I noticed a magnificent landscape
    of immense yellow rocks, strangely intricate with the most
    imposing shapes.</p>

    <p>In the tiny valleys between these rocks were rows of
    small round trees with foliage of olive-green or grey-green,
    which could well be lemon trees.</p>

    <p>But here in Arles the country appears flat. I saw some
    magnificant red terrain planted with grapevines, with a
    background of mountains of the most delicate lilac. And the
    landscapes in the snow, with the summits white against a sky as
    luminous as the snow, were just like winter landscapes done
    by the Japanese.</p>

    <p>Here is my address:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Restaurant Carrel,<br>

    30 Rue Cavalerie,<br>

    (Departement Bouches du Rh&ocirc;ne) Arles.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>I have only taken a little trip into the town so far, since I was
    more or less dog-tired last night.</p>

    <p>I'll write soon. In an antique shop on the same
    street that I went into yesterday, the man told me he knew of a Monticelli.</p>

    <p>With a good handshake to you and our comrades.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
