    <p>My dear friend,</p>

    Enclosed is a letter which arrived yesterday, but which the
    concierge didn't give me straight away.<br>

    I've been to the Tambourin, since if I hadn't gone, they
    would have thought I was afraid.<br>

    And I told la Segatori that I wouldn't pass judgement on her
    in this matter, but that it was for her to judge herself.<br>

    That I had torn up the receipt for the pictures - but that
    she had to return <i>everything</i>.<br>

    That if she had not had a hand in what had happened to me,
    she would have seen me the next day.<br>

    That as she didn't come to see me, my feeling was that she
    knew they were trying to pick a quarrel with me, but that she
    had tried to warn me by saying, &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; which I
    hadn't understood, and furthermore, perhaps didn't want to
    understand.<br>

    To which she replied that the pictures, &amp; all the rest,
    were at my disposal. She maintained that it was I who had tried
    to pick a quarrel - which doesn't surprise me - knowing that if
    she sided with me they would take it out on her. I also saw the
    waiter when I went in, but he made himself scarce. I didn't
    want to take the pictures immediately, but I said that when you
    returned we would discuss the matter because these pictures
    belong to you as much as to me, and in the meantime I advised
    her to think about what had happened again. She didn't look
    well and was white as a sheet, which isn't a good sign. She
    didn't know that the waiter had gone up to your place. If
    that's true, I would be more inclined to believe she had tried
    to warn me they were trying to pick a quarrel with me than that
    she had plotted the whole thing herself. She cannot do as she
    likes. I'm awaiting your return now before taking any
    action.<br>

    I've done two pictures since you left. Have only got two
    louis left and I'm afraid I don't know how I'm going to manage
    from now until your return.<br>

    Don't forget that when I started working at Asni&egrave;res
    I had plenty of canvases and Tanguy was very good to me. In
    fact he still is, but his old witch of a wife realized what was
    going on and complained. So I gave Tanguy's wife a piece of my
    mind and told her that it was her fault if I didn't buy
    anything more from them. Old man Tanguy is sensible enough to
    keep quiet, and will do whatever I want anyway. But with all
    this, work isn't easy.<br>

    I saw Lautrec today, he's sold a picture, through Portier I
    think. A watercolour of Mme. Mesdag's has arrived which I find
    very beautiful. <sup>1</sup><br>

    Now I hope you'll enjoy your trip over there, remember me to
    my mother, to Cor &amp; to Wil. And if you could manage, by
    sending me something again, to ensure that I don't have too
    hard a time from now until you get back, then I shall try to do
    some more pictures for you - as I'm really very happy as far as
    my work goes. What worried me a little about this business was
    that it looked a little cowardly not going there, to the
    Tambourin. And my peace of mind has been restored by my going
    there.<br>

    <p>I shake your hand,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
