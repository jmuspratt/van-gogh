    <p>W14<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Saint-R&eacute;my, 19 September 1889</p>

    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p>In the interval since my last letter I have tried more than
    once to write a letter to you and Mother. I therefore thank you
    very much for the second kind letter you wrote me. I think both
    you and Mother did right to leave Breda after Cor went away -
    it is certain that we ought not to let grief accumulate in our
    heart like water in a turbid pool. It is true that I have a
    profound feeling at times that my mind is turbid indeed, but
    this is a disease; for persons who are active and in good
    health, however, it is certainly necessary to do what you have
    done.</p>

    <p>As I told Mother in my letter, I shall send her a picture -
    say within a month or so - and there will be one for you
    too.</p>

    <p>These last weeks I have also painted some pictures for
    myself - I don't especially like to see my own pictures in my
    bedroom, which is why <art id=0630>I copied one picture by Delacroix</art> and some
    others by Millet. <sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>The Delacroix is a &ldquo;Piet&agrave;&rdquo; that is
    to say the dead Christ with the Mater Dolorosa. The exhausted
    corpse lies on the ground in the entrance of a cave, the hands
    held before it on the left side, and the woman is behind it. It
    is in the evening after a thunderstorm, and that forlorn figure
    in blue clothes - the loose clothes are agitated by the wind -
    is sharply outlined against a sky in which violet clouds with
    golden edges are floating. She too stretches out her empty arms
    before her in a large gesture of despair, and one sees the good
    sturdy hands of a working woman. The shape of the figure with
    its streaming clothes is nearly as broad as it is high. And the
    face of the dead man is in the shadow - but the pale head of
    the woman stands out clearly against a cloud - a contrast which
    causes those two heads to seem like one somber-hued flower and
    one pale flower, arranged in such a way as mutually to
    intensify the effect.</p>

    <p>I do not know what had become of this picture, but at the
    very time I was busy working on it, I happened to read an
    article by Pierre Loti, author of My Brother Yves, Fisherman of
    Iceland [P&eacute;cheur d'Islande] and of Madame
    Chrysanth&eacute;me. An article he wrote about Carmen
    Sylva. You have read her poems, if my memory doesn't deceive
    me. She is a queen - is she the queen of Hungary or of some
    other country? - that I do not know - and Loti, when describing
    her boudoir, or rather her studio in which she writes and
    applies herself to the art of painting, says that he saw the
    canvas of Delacroix's in question, and that it made a deep
    impression on him.</p>

    <p>When speaking of Carmen Sylva he makes his readers feel that
    her personality is even more interesting than her words, though
    she says things like these: A woman without a child is like a
    bell without a clapper - perhaps the sound of the bronze is
    very fine - but&hellip;</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact it does one good to think that such a
    painting should be in such hands, and it may be something of a
    consolation to the painters to be able to imagine that there
    really are souls who have a feeling for pictures. But there are
    relatively few of them.</p>

    <p>I thought fit to send you a sketch of it in order to give
    you an idea of what Delacroix is. Please understand fully that
    this little copy hasn't the slightest value, whatever the point
    of view. Notwithstanding which you may see from it that
    Delacroix does not draw the features of a Mater Dolorosa after
    the manner of the Roman statues, but there is in it the grayish
    white countenance, the lost, vague look of a person exhausted
    by anxiety and weeping and waking, rather in the manner of
    Germinie Lacerteux.</p>

    <p>It is a very good and fortunate thing, as I see it, that you
    are not quite enthusiastic about the masterly book by de
    Goncourt. All the better that you should prefer Tolstoi, you
    who read books in the first place to draw from them the energy
    to act. I tell you, you are a thousand times in the right.</p>

    <p>But I, who read books to find the artist who wrote them,
    should I for my part be in the wrong if I like the French
    novelists so much?</p>

    <p>The other day I finished <art id=0631>the portrait of a woman upward of
    forty years old, an insignificant woman. The withered face is
    tired, pockmarked - a sunburned, olive-coloured complexion,
    black hair. A faded black dress relieved by a geranium of a
    delicate pink, and the background in a neutral tone, between
    pink and green</art>.</p>

    <p>For I often paint things like that - as insignificant and as
    dramatic as a dusty blade of grass by the roadside - and
    consequently it seems to me that it is only right that I should
    have a boundless admiration for de Goncourt, Zola, Flaubert,
    Maupassant, Huysmans. As for you, don't hurry, and go on
    courageously with your Russians.</p>

    <p>Have you already read My Religion by Tolstoi? It is said to
    be very practical and really useful. So dive into the very
    depths of it, seeing that you like this.</p>

    <p>I painted <art id=0626>two pictures</art> of <art id=0627>myself lately</art>, one of
    which has rather the true character, I
    think, although in Holland they would probably scoff at the
    ideas about portrait painting that are germinating here. Did
    you see the self-portrait by the painter Guillaumin at Theo's,
    and the portrait of a young woman by the same? They give an
    idea of what painters are looking for. When Guillaumin
    exhibited his self-portrait, public and artists were greatly
    amused by it, and yet it is one of those rare things capable of
    holding their own beside the old Dutch painters, even Rembrandt
    and Hals. I always think photographs abominable, and I don't
    like to have them around, particularly not those of persons I
    know and love.</p>

    <p>Those photographic portraits wither much sooner than we
    ourselves do, whereas the painted portrait is a thing which is
    felt, done with love or respect for the human being that is
    portrayed. What is left of the old Dutchmen except their
    portraits?</p>

    <p>In the same way the children in Mauve's family will always
    see him in the portrait Masker painted so well of him.</p>

    <p>I just received a letter from Theo, in which he replies to
    what I told him about my wish to return to the North for some
    time. It is rather probable that this will happen, but it is
    impossible to say when, as this depends on what opportunities
    present themselves for going to live with some artist or other.
    But seeing that we know a good many of them, and that it is
    often to their mutual advantage for two artists to live
    together, it won't take long.</p>

    <p>Well, in conclusion I say to you, &ldquo;See you
    soon,&rdquo; and I thank you very much for your letters.</p>

    <p>I don't know yet which canvases I am going to send you and
    Mother, probably <art id=0619>a field of wheat</art> and <art id=0711>an orchard of olive
    trees,</art> together with that copy after Delacroix.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.reclusive">It is splendid weather outside - but for a long time - two
    months to be exact - I have not left my room; I don't know
    why.</p>

    <p>What I need is courage, and this often fails me.</p>

    <p>And it is also a fact that since my disease, when I am in
    the fields I am overwhelmed by a feeling of loneliness to such
    a horrible extent that I shy away from going out.</label> But this will
    change all the same as time goes on. Only when I stand painting
    before my easel do I feel somewhat alive. Never mind, this is
    going to change too, for now my health is so good that I
    suppose the physical part of me will gain the victory.</p>

    <p>I embrace you in thought, and &ldquo;see you
    soon!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
