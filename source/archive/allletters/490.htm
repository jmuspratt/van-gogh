    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I read a notice in L'Intransigeant that there is to be an
    exhibition of impressionists at Durand Ruel's - there will be
    some of Caillebotte's pictures - I have never seen any of his
    stuff, and I want to ask you to write me what it is like, there
    are sure to be other remarkable things.</p>

    <p>Today I <art id=1418>sent</art> you<art id=1448> some </art>more <art id=1493>drawings</art>, and I am putting in
    another two. These are <art id=1419>views taken from a rocky hill</art>, from
    which you see <art id=1475>the country towards Crau (very good wine comes
    from there), the town of Arles and the country towards
    Fontvieilles</art>. The contrast between the wild and romantic foreground, and the distant
    perspective, wide and still, with horizontal lines sloping into
    the chain of the Alpines, so famous for the great climbing
    feats of Tartarin P. C. A., and of the Alpine Club - this
    contrast is very striking. The <art id=1423>two belated drawings</art> that<art id=1417> I am
    adding now</art> will give you an idea of the ruin that crowns the
    rocks. But is it worth the trouble to make frames for this Dordrecht exhibition?</p>

    <p>It seems idiotic to me, and I would rather not be in it.</p>

    <p>I should like to think that Bernard or Gauguin will exchange
    drawings with us, so that the Dutch will see <i>nothing</i>.</p>

    <p>Have you met the Dane, Mourier Petersen? He will have brought you two more drawings.</p>

    <p>He has studied medicine, but I suppose he was discouraged by
    the student's life, and by the other fellows and the professors
    as well. He never said anything to me about it though, except
    once when he stated, &ldquo;It's the doctors that kill
    people.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When he came here, he was suffering from a nervous disorder,
    which had been brought on by the strain of the examinations. I
    do not know how long he has been painting - he certainly hasn't
    gone very far as a painter - but he's a good fellow to knock
    around with, and he observes people and often sums them up very
    accurately.</p>

    <p>Do you think it would work if he were to come and stay with
    you? I think that in intelligence he would be very much
    preferable to that L., of whom - I don't know why - I have a
    very poor opinion. You certainly don't want sixth-grade Dutch
    and worse about you, the sort that will say and do idiotic
    things when they go home. Unfortunately, a picture dealer is
    more or less a public character. Not that it matters much.</p>

    <p>The Swede [This is referring to Mourier, who was Danish.
    Vincent makes the same odd mistake in letter 498] comes from a
    good family, he has a sort of decency and orderliness in his
    way of life and as a man; he reminds me of the kind of
    character you find in Pierre Loti's books. With all his
    stolidity, he has some heart.</p>

    <p>I expect to be drawing a lot more. It's good and hot
    already, I can tell you.</p>

    <p>I must add an order for colours to this, though in case
    you'd rather not get them at once, I can do a few more drawings
    and it will not be time wasted. Also, I divided the order in
    two, according to what is more or less urgent.</p>

    <p>What is always urgent is the drawing, and whether you do it
    straight off with the brush or with something else, say a pen,
    you never get enough done.</p>

    <p>I am trying now to exaggerate the essential, and purposely
    leave the obvious things vague.</p>

    <p>I am very glad that you have bought the book on Daumier, but
    if you could make a complete job of it by buying some more of
    his lithographs, it would be all to the good, for in the future
    the Daumiers will not be as easy to get hold of.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">How are you? Have you seen old Gruby again? I rather think
    that he exaggerates the heart trouble, a little to the
    detriment of the drastic treatment that you need for your
    nerves.</label></p>

    <p>But in the end he will come to see it in proportion as you
    follow his treatment; with Gruby you will survive, but
    unfortunately for us, it is more than the old boy will do
    himself, for he is aging, and when the time comes when we shall
    need him most, he won't be there.</p>

    <p>I feel more and more that we must not judge of God from this
    world, it's just a study that didn't come off. What can you do
    with a study that has gone wrong? - if you are fond of the
    artist, you do not find much to criticize - you hold your
    tongue. But you have the right to ask for something better. We
    should have to see other works by the same hand though; this
    world was evidently slapped together in a hurry on one of his
    bad days, when the artist didn't know what he was doing or
    didn't have his wits about him. All the same, according to what
    the legend says, this good old God took a terrible lot of
    trouble over this world-study of his.</p>

    <p>I am inclined to think that the legend is right, but then
    the study is ruined in so many ways. It is only a master who
    can make such a blunder, and perhaps that is the best
    consolation we can have out of it, since in that case we have a
    right to hope that we'll see the same creative hand get even
    with itself. And this life of ours, so much criticized, and for
    good and even exalted reasons, we must not take it for anything
    but what it is, and go on hoping that in some other life we'll
    see something better than this.</p>

    <p>With a handshake for you and Koning.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I am hoping to hear from you tomorrow; if not, I'll be in
    rather a bad way, since I have only enough money for tomorrow,
    Sunday. Have you at long last received the case? I am not much
    surprised in a way at its going slowly, seeing that it had to
    be taken from one station to another, but all the same!</p>
