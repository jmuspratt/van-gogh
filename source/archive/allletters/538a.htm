  <body>
    <p>I am inclined to think that the letter Gauguin wrote you
    throws a clear light on the question.</p>

    <p>But I should not like to rely on the word of an artist of
    his merit when he says: You will have to pay my travelling
    expenses and my debts if you want me to come, for I myself have
    not got any money. But on the other hand, if this is the case,
    he ought to be very generous with his pictures. So that's that;
    however, in any case there would have to be money - but then I
    don't see much harm in the business. But those pictures, which
    will be sold one day, may freeze the interest on the purchase
    money invested for years to come. As a matter of fact, a
    picture for which you pay 400 francs today, and which you sell
    for 1000 francs after ten years, will still be sold at the
    current price, as all that time nothing could be done with the
    money. Well, you know this better than I.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">I should not be surprised if little by little you regained
    your love for business, or at least if you got reconciled to
    your present situation, as soon as you feel that the inventors
    of new things in commerce do not know how to produce a great
    revolution in it. You are good to the artists, you are in the
    very center of the trade, you do what you can, you are damned
    right. Only take care of your health if you can, and don't get
    into a stew over nothing. Now, if it must come, it will come of
    its own accord.</label></p>

    <p>I only want to stress the point that it appears to me that
    if Gauguin deposited his pictures exclusively with you and
    calmly awaited his hour, working with me here, and if he paid
    us for our out-of-pocket expenses with his work, he would be
    pursuing a policy that I would respect more than any other he
    might adopt.</p>

    <p>With regard to Bernard - if Bernard should want to come
    here, it would not be on the same terms as Gauguin, at least so
    it seems to me.</p>

    <p>If living together should be to his advantage, nothing would
    prevent your agreeing to buy something from him from time to
    time, if it is possible. But no arrangement of any sort with
    him, for he is too fickle.</p>

    <p>If Gauguin should not come, he will succeed all the same,
    but then he will not succeed by means of his combining, but
    through the intrinsic merits of his canvases, if only he goes
    on having the time, the money and the liberty necessary to
    paint them - that's all. I assure you that under the present
    circumstances I should not be a better businessman than you
    are, so much is certain, and so much you know too, only I
    should like to send you better pictures. This I endeavour to
    do, and this I shall go on endeavouring to do.<art id=0470> Very soon the
    hour will come for me to resume my painting in the garden.</art> It
    is a tremendous advantage for me not to be short of canvases
    and paints, and so it is my bounden duty to work on
    indefatigably. If Gauguin should come, I think we might try to
    make our colours at home; I dare not do it alone, for I am
    afraid of getting discouraged if I do not succeed at once. I am
    very curious to know what price Tanguy will ask for his tubes.
    Did you read in the number of the Courrier Fran&ccedil;ais you
    sent me an article entitled &ldquo;La trace bleue&rdquo;? Very
    good, it just makes one think of Segatori. No doubt you will
    read this article with pleasure.</p>
