  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>The drawings for this month are still at Rappard's, else I
    should have sent them to you already. And as Rappard intends to
    come soon and stay with us for some time, I have asked him to
    bring them with him then.</p>

    <p>It gives me much pleasure that you wrote about Cor in the
    way I learned from your letter to Father and Mother. How
    fortunate that Braat is recovering - I trust you will have seen
    in the meantime that in what you thought you had to write about
    him you were radically wrong - am I right? I hope you will have
    seen it.</p>

    <p>Further, I want to revert to what I wrote you about Rappard.
    I do not think it necessary to talk much to him about you, as
    long as you and I are not on better terms than we are at the
    moment.</p>

    <p>Now, just think whether it wouldn't be very unkind of you
    toward him if you took no notice of his visit when he comes
    here before long. Think over whether it is right that you, who
    know Rappard, have seen nothing of his work, do not even know
    what he makes except for what I tell you, that you do not take
    the slightest notice of him. Yet he is one of the people that
    will count - who will assert themselves - of whose work one
    will have to take notice. At one time Rappard came to you, and
    felt small in your presence because you knew so much about art.
    Since that year he spent in Paris - what enormous progress he
    has made!</p>

    <p>I don't think you would regret it if you took my hint to
    heart. I simply want you to renew the acquaintance with
    him.</p>

    <p>There is all the more reason for it because he is more
    advanced than I am. I say this simply to prevent your being
    guilty of negligence.</p>

    <p>I do not know what impression it would make on Rappard if I
    told him what has been wrong between us recently.</p>

    <p>But I know for certain that the work I showed him during
    these last months pleased him. I should greatly prefer being
    able to tell him that all was well between us.</p>

    <p>But I shall not bore you with this. If you want to divide
    art - by drawing sharp, straight, rigid lines - into things
    that one may show in the full light of day and things that one
    should calmly neglect with great singleness of purpose - well,
    that's your affair.</p>

    <p>And at the moment the whole question is so deeply repulsive
    to me that I for my part will not expiate on it.</p>

    <p>As to Rappard, it is curious what absurd things he sometimes
    hears about his work, which he takes quite coolly. One must be
    prepared for that, and have a certain self-confidence, so as
    not to let oneself be confounded or upset. Friends whose
    cordiality makes up for the bother the work causes are of great
    value to a painter. If you should feel personal sympathy for
    Rappard's work, he would certainly not feel indifferent toward
    you either.</p>

    <p>But he as well as I, we are getting more and more
    disillusioned about finding sympathy, and are more and more
    determined to persevere without minding what anybody says.</p>

    <p>As for Mother, the fact is that there is nothing the matter
    with her any more, except that she must learn to walk all over
    again - and that the leg must be loosened up by means of
    regular exercises. It might have been worse. Goodbye.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
