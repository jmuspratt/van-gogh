    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter, write to me often, for I long to
    hear from you in these days. Write me at length, speak to me of
    your daily life, you see that I am doing the same. What you
    told me about Boks was very interesting, how he arranged his
    studio, and that you go there often - keep me well informed
    about those things.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.loneliness">We feel lonely now
    and then and long for friends and think
    we should be quite different and happier if we found a friend
    of whom we might say: &ldquo;<i>He is the one</i>.&rdquo; But
    you, too, will begin to learn that there is much self-deception
    behind this longing; if we yielded too much to it, it would
    lead us from the road.</label></p>

    <p>There is a phrase that haunts me these days - it is today's
    text, &ldquo;His children will seek to please the
    poor.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And now here is some news: my friend Gladwell is moving. One
    of the employees of the printing office convinced him to come
    and lodge with him; for quite a while he did everything he
    could to persuade him.</p>

    <p>I know that Gladwell made this decision without thinking
    about it, I regret his departure very much; it will be soon,
    probably towards the end of the month.</p>

    <p>For several days we have had a mouse in our
    &ldquo;cabin&rdquo;, which is what we call our room. Every
    night, we put bread on the floor for it, and it knows already
    where to find it.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I have been reading the ads in the English newspapers, and I
    have already answered some of them. Let us hope for
    success.</label></p>

    <p>Kind regards to Roos and others if they ask about me, and
    write soon. &Agrave; Dieu. Tell me if Mr. Tersteeg mentions me
    to you; give him my kindest regards whenever I write to you.
    Always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
