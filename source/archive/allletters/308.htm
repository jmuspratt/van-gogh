    <p>Letter 308<br>
     The Hague, c. 2 August 1883</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter of yesterday and the enclosure.
    Fortunately they have also changed the other note for 23
    guilders. So I have been able to pay off the most pressing
    debts, though not all, for there was so much to pay at once for
    the colours I had used in the meantime.</p>

    <p>I wonder if you intend to do as you did last year, first go
    home for a few days, and then come straightway here. Promise me
    that you won't mention misgivings about the future at home, or
    the small chance of selling my work. At least not immediately;
    first let's talk things over and see what there is.</p>

    <p>Theo, I am enormously eager to paint <art id=009>the potato diggers</art>. I
    think it would be a good thing. And even if it weren't sold, it
    would help us make progress, as some people sometimes change
    their opinion when they have seen something they did not
    expect.</p>

    <p>Well, I made a few studies for it already, but I haven't
    been able to take enough models; and I feel sure of doing them
    much better now if I could spend more money on them.</p>

    <p>It is exactly the right time now, therefore there can be no
    question of taking a holiday, for I keep at work as best I can.
    But your idea of doing as Weissenbruch does is the same as
    mine. However, I literally <i>cannot</i> carry it out, because
    going to the polders for two weeks would cost me more than it
    would to stay home for two weeks, and I don't even know how to
    struggle through those first two weeks at home.</p>

    <p>But for the rest, as I already wrote you, I am also quite
    absorbed in landscape; I am making landscape studies or marines
    to give myself a change from the figure and it does me good.
    But after all the figure calls me back, and so strongly that I
    try to do whatever circumstances allow; if I could go on as I
    liked, autumn would not pass without my doing those potato
    diggers.</p>

    <p>I don't know whether the studies I paint from the drawings
    will be satisfactory, but &ldquo;quand bien m&ecirc;me,&rdquo;
    I will try to make something of it.</p>

    <p>Models are not easy to get at present, because there is a
    great deal of work in the fields; I wish I could spend more on
    them, for then it would be possible to overcome that
    difficulty. Well, as soon as I can possibly afford it - now it
    is absolutely impossible - I will try to get two fellows for a
    whole day out in the dunes to pose for the potato diggers. That
    would be the shortest and safest way.</p>

    <p>In the days which must elapse before you come, I hope to
    paint a few more things. <label content="health.general">I don't feel entirely well yet, but
    fortunately the work is so animating that as long as I am busy,
    I don't feel the weakness so much; but it overtakes me
    occasionally during the intervals when I am not in front of my
    easel.</label><label content="psychology.neurological"> Sometimes it's a kind of dizziness, and at times a
    headache too.</label> Well, it's nothing but weakness. <label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">I have
    repeatedly put off taking more nourishing food because there
    were other things more pressing, but it has lasted a little too
    long.</label></p>

    <p>But you will understand that the work is rather important,
    and I could not drop it now for the very reason that so much of
    it is already done. When you come, you will see for yourself
    that it is necessary to go on steadily. You are right in saying
    that what I wrote you about the finances weighs on your mind,
    but on the other hand, we cannot now be far from the moment
    when I shall make something that is saleable, even if it be for
    a small price.</p>

    <p>The work becomes more and more clear to me.</p>

    <p>And when I think it over, it is only a question of hurrying
    or slackening speed, and we shall make up for it later, even
    for the past; but after all it is a damn thorny, difficult and
    hard time we are going through now.</p>

    <p>If it were possible for me to get enough money to have
    sufficient colours and models this season, things would clear
    up more than a little, I think. At all events, it's fine that
    you will be here soon.</p>

    <p>Recently a very heavy care has fallen on my shoulders. Last
    year I repeatedly tried to paint figure studies, but the way
    they turned out made me desperate. Now I have begun again, and
    now there is nothing that keeps me from carrying it out,
    because drawing comes so much more easily to me than last year.
    I used to get in a muddle then whenever I lost hold of my
    sketch while painting; and it took me a long time to make that
    sketch, so that when I could only have the model for a short
    time, I made an absolute mess of it.</p>

    <p>But now I don't care in the least if the drawing is wiped
    out; and I am now only doing them directly with the brush, and
    then the form stands out enough for study to be of use to me.
    Therefore I say that I see the way before me more clearly. I
    know that I'll have to make many studies, but they won't cost
    me more trouble than the drawings, and therefore a great deal
    of painting must be done this year, and then there will come
    more light. I am fully convinced of that. So next winter I
    intend to paint the same kind of studies of heads as those
    which I sent you a few drawings of. I would even do it at once
    now if it were not more important to get hold of figures in the
    field while the season is in full swing.</p>

    <p>Van der Weele is out of town during the holidays - I heard
    he got the silver medal at Amsterdam for his picture,
    &ldquo;The Loaders of Sand.&rdquo; When he comes back to town,
    I hope to see a great deal of him, because I believe those
    potato diggers will intrigue him, and perhaps he would give me
    some useful hints for the execution of my plan. And Rappard,
    too, when he comes back.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">The first two figures I painted this year were done in the
    way I tried last year, drawing them, and then filling in the
    outline. That is what I'd like to call the dry manner. The
    other way is to make the drawing last of all, and first find
    the tones without caring too much about the drawing, only
    trying to put the tones in their right places; and then
    gradually make the form and the subdivisions of the colours
    more exactly. That surrounds the figure with more atmosphere
    and gives it a mellower aspect, while the colours become more
    delicate for the very reason that one often brushes them over,
    and mixes one colour with another.</label></p>

    <p>You will see the difference when the first two I made now
    remain in their present condition.</p>

    <p>There is an exhibition of drawings which was held last year
    in the Gothic Hall, but I think it very meager this year; there
    is little one has not already seen before, and then generally
    of a better quality. I counted a few drawings by J. van Berg
    among the best there. Generally it is such that Schipperus and
    the like are among the best.</p>

    <p>As to the painting of those potato diggers, I just saw Van
    der Weele's last picture being painted, and at Rappard's I saw
    all the studies for the pictures he made last year. So that I
    can well imagine beforehand what the difficulties I shall have
    to overcome for the ultimate picture will be.</p>

    <p>If I can afford it, I shall make a few studies for it in the
    dunes before you come, namely, I shall go with my model to
    those fields behind Loosduinen early in the morning or in the
    evening twilight. I think I can make something of it.</p>

    <p>The composition of the drawing will probably be altered a
    little, and especially the effect more thoroughly studied, but
    in general I would keep it as it is. I think the figures must
    stand out strongly, and all the rest in a violet-grey haze.</p>

    <p>In the drawings I think the division of dark and lighter
    planes too complicated, the figures being partly light and
    partly dark, and the ground likewise. Either the ground and the
    figures must be brought more into harmony and form a dark
    silhouette against a light sky - or sky and ground must form
    together a misty grey whole, against which the toneful planes
    of the figures stand out.</p>

    <p>Both these effects exist, but that of the drawing is not
    right the way it is now, for it is too dry, and too meager, and
    because the figures have too many tones in common with the
    ground, they do not stand out, and the sky is not part of it.
    Well, the tone must become quite different, but the composition
    needs very little alteration.</p>

    <p>It gives me a certain restful feeling to think that we shall
    see each other soon, and can consult together about how to go
    on with the work. Meanwhile, I will try to make a few new
    things, and therefore I should very much like to receive the
    money a few days before the tenth if possible. Then I would try
    to make those studies in the dunes before you come. I cannot
    afford it now, as I had so much to pay. You remember what you
    wrote about the possibility of being disappointed in your share
    of the profits in business. Well, I hope that catastrophe will
    not occur, but we must consider it a piece of good luck if it
    turns out well, and we must not lose a minute of time that it
    is still before us.</p>

    <p>I should be very astonished if, in the long run, some people
    did not alter their opinion about my doing or planning absurd
    things. I think you will see what I mean by the studies, and
    you will remember some of our previous talks on art. We must
    try to keep courage and persevere. A thing that gave me a good
    deal of courage recently is that though I had not painted for
    several months, I believe there is progress in the present
    <i>painted</i> studies compared to last year's. It is because
    matters of drawing and proportion which gave me a lot of
    trouble then have been mastered now, so that when sitting
    before nature, instead of having to think of two things at
    once, drawing and painting, I only have to think of the
    painting. Of course when intensifying the painting, one has to
    think of both at once, but even that is different.</p>

    <p>Well, I shall live these days in the hope of your coming. If
    I have some luck with my painting, perhaps things will become a
    little easier.</p>

    <p>The two weeks between now and your coming will not be easy
    to get through, however.</p>

    <p>If possible, think of what I asked you, to send something a
    few days before the tenth, for then I could try to make those
    figure studies in the dunes before you come. Adieu and once
    more thanks for your letter, and good luck in everything;
    believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
