  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I sometimes think, If my life were somewhat easier, how much
    more and how much better I should then be able to work! But I
    do work, and as you must have noticed from my last drawings, I
    begin to see a light that will conquer the difficulties. But
    you know that in addition to the exertion of drawing, scarcely
    a day passes without bringing some difficulty or other which in
    itself would be hard enough to bear. And, you see, there is a
    sorrow which I think I don't really deserve - at least I don't
    know in what way I deserve it - and which I should like to get
    rid of. You must tell me frankly, if you will be so kind,
    whether you know the cause of the following, and can give me
    any information about it.</p>

    <p>Near the end of January, I think a fortnight after my
    arrival here, Mauve's attitude toward me changed suddenly -
    became as unfriendly as it had been friendly before. I ascribed
    it to his not being satisfied with my work, and I was so
    anxious and worried over it that it quite upset me and made me
    ill, as I wrote you at the time. Mauve then came to see me, and
    again reassured me that everything would turn out all right,
    and encouraged me.</p>

    <p>But then on a certain evening shortly thereafter, he again
    began to speak to me in such a different way that it seemed as
    if quite a different man was before me. I thought, My dear
    friend, it seems as if they have poisoned your ear with
    slander; but I was in the dark as to the side from which the
    poisonous wind had blown. Among other things, Mauve began to
    imitate my speech and my manners, saying, &ldquo;Your face
    looks like this,&rdquo; &ldquo;You speak like this&rdquo; - all
    in a spiteful way. But he is very clever at those things, and I
    must say it was like a good caricature of me, but drawn with
    hatred.</p>

    <p>On that occasion he said a few things that only Tersteeg
    used to say, and I asked him, Mauve, have you seen Tersteeg
    lately? &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mauve, and we talked on, but
    about ten minutes later he remarked that Tersteeg had been to
    see him that same day.</p>

    <p>Then involuntarily the thought of Tersteeg stayed with me,
    and I thought, Is it possible, my dear Tersteeg, that you are
    behind all this? And I wrote him a note, <i>not impolite</i>,
    deliberately not impolite, I only said to him, Sir, I am so
    sorry when things such as &ldquo;You do not earn your
    living&rdquo; or &ldquo;You do not work&rdquo; are said about
    me; you must understand such things are too unreasonable for me
    to let them pass, and they dishearten me. During recent years I
    have had too many such things to grieve me, and I think there
    must come an end to it now.</p>

    <p>This was the note which Tersteeg spoke to you about on his
    first visit to Paris.</p>

    <p>When he came back from Paris, I went to see him and told him
    that if I had charged him with things for which he was not
    responsible, I hoped he would excuse me, because I was quite in
    the dark as to the cause of my difficulty. Well, then he was
    very kind to me again - but though I still visited Mauve once
    in a while, Mauve was moody and rather unkind. And I was told
    he was not at home a few times, in short, there were all the
    signs of a decided estrangement. I went to see him less and
    less, and Mauve never came to my house again, though it is not
    far away.</p>

    <p>Mauve's talk also became narrow-minded, if I may call it so,
    as it used to be broad-minded. I had to draw from casts, that
    was the principal thing, he said. I hate drawing from casts,
    but I had a few plaster hands and feet hanging in my studio,
    though not for drawing purposes. Once he spoke to me about
    drawing from casts in a way such as the worst teacher at the
    academy would not have spoken; I kept quiet, but when I got
    home I was so angry that I threw those poor plaster casts into
    the coalbin, and they were smashed to pieces. And I thought, I
    will draw from those casts only when they become whole and
    white again, and when there are no more hands and feet of
    living beings to draw from.</p>

    <p>Then I said to Mauve, Man, don't mention plaster to me
    again, because I can't stand it. That was followed by a note
    from Mauve, telling me that he would not have anything to do
    with me for two months. Indeed, we did not see each other
    during those two months, but meanwhile I have not been idle,
    though I have not drawn from casts, I can tell you, and I must
    say I worked with more animation and earnestness once I was
    free.</p>

    <p>When the two months were almost up, I just wrote to
    congratulate him on having finished his large picture, and once
    I spoke to him on the street for a moment.</p>

    <p>Now the two months have long since past, and he has not come
    to see me. And since then things have happened with Tersteeg
    which made me write Mauve: &ldquo;Let us shake hands and not
    feel animosity or bitterness toward each other, but it is too
    difficult for you to guide me and it is too difficult for me to
    be guided by you if you require `strict obedience' to all you
    say - I cannot give that. So that's the end of the guiding and
    being guided. But it does not alter my feeling of gratefulness
    and obligation toward you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mauve has not answered this and I have not seen him since.
    What urged me to say to Mauve, We must each go our own way, was
    the evidence that Tersteeg really influenced Mauve. I learned
    it from Tersteeg himself when he told me he would see to it
    that you stopped sending me money, &ldquo;Mauve and I will see
    to it that there is an end to this.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I then wrote H. G. Tersteeg a less amiable note than the
    first - and I particularly thanked him for his kind endeavours
    to &ldquo;guide&rdquo; me. This time I thought fit to speak my
    mind, Theo, for you see, I remembered that on the first evening
    I recognized one of H. G. T.'s expressions, Mauve did not want
    to confess he had seen him. And then I thought, Well, Tersteeg,
    are these your &ldquo;distinguished manners,&rdquo; that first
    you go and poison Mauve's mind, and later try to take from me
    the only assistance I receive! I didn't know such things were
    called &ldquo;distinguished manners&rdquo;; I thought they were
    called <i>treachery</i>.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">Theo, I am a man with faults and errors and passions, but I
    don't think I ever tried to deprive anyone of his bread or his
    friends. I have sometimes fought people with words, but
    attempting a man's life because of a difference of opinion is
    not the work of an honest man - at least, these are not honest
    weapons.</p>

    <p>Can you understand now that I am sometimes grieved over many
    things, grieved to the heart; and that I am grieved about
    Mauve? For though I shouldn't want to have the same
    &ldquo;guidance&rdquo; from him again, I should like to shake
    hands with him once more, and I wish he would do the same with
    me.</label></p>

    <p>Do you perhaps know something that I do not, or can you give
    me some information about this matter? Adieu.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Forgive me if I trouble you about it, but, you see, I am so
    in the dark. I finished another drawing of a woman's figure
    such as &ldquo;Sorrow,&rdquo; but larger and I think better
    than the first; and I am doing a <art id=930a>drawing of a street where they
    are digging to lay sewer or water pipes</art>, &ldquo;Diggers in a
    Trench.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Breitner is still in the hospital and will perhaps have to
    stay there another month.</p>

    <p>I am making the drawings for C. M., but I have been so
    depressed about what I have written you that it hindered my
    work; and then I thought, I must have light, perhaps Theo can
    give me some information.</p>
