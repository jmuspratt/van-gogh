  <body>
    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half August 1885</p>

    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I just received your letter and the sketch of your picture.
    <sup>1</sup> It certainly is a beautiful subject, and I have
    nothing to object to in the composition as far as the
    equilibrium is concerned.</p>

    <p>But will you allow me to say <i>one</i> thing? - which I
    would <i>not</i> say if the picture were finished and therefore
    difficult to alter, but which I <i>do</i> say because certain
    alterations that <i>won't</i> affect the <i>lines</i> might be
    carried out to advantage. Here you are then: the figure in the
    middle of the picture - the woman with the rake [sic]
    <sup>2</sup> - is well placed. But the raking of that
    spot is a matter of <i>such</i> minor importance, in my
    opinion, that it ought not to be done by a <i>main
    figure</i>. For this reason I for my part should prefer
    the central figure - in the foreground - to be the one <i>who
    carries the bricks</i> (this being an action that would be very
    expressive here, and motivated by the <i>whole</i>), and
    I should prefer to give the figure on the <i>second</i> plane
    (who is now carrying bricks - and who now occupies a secondary
    place in the composition) a rake to hold in her hands.</p>

    <p>Is this possible with regard to the working process? If not,
    please think about the problem - for it is not unimportant, it
    seems to me, and might be criticized. It is <i>right</i> for
    the figure to be standing erect in that place, but wouldn't it
    be possible to invent a more interesting <i>action</i> -
    without altering the lines? Don't take offense at this, please
    - I don't believe it can do any harm to make such suggestions
    when a picture is in the planning stage. I don't think this
    means forcing my ideas upon you. Especially if the picture is
    to be a large one, I consider it most important for the
    <i>actions</i> to be expressive. I know this is making
    <i>high</i> demands - I know that the lines and the equilibrium
    of the lines are paramount factors here.</p>

    <p>But these lines may remain beautiful and quiet. Well, it is
    <i>possible</i> that I am not wrong about this - and your
    principal figure is at stake - so I did not dare conceal my
    impression. If it is not asking <i>too</i> much, I want to
    offer the suggestion that you let one of the women carrying
    bricks stoop and lay them out, so that the two of them are not
    doing the same work. But it would come to the same thing, as
    there would then be <i>two stooping</i> figures. <i>And after
    all it does not matter so much</i>. But my <i>first</i>
    observation is what I really mainly feel.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">As for my work, that scene of the potato eaters - you saw
    the lithograph of it - is a subject that I tried to paint,
    being inspired by the peculiar light effect in that grimy
    cottage. It is kept in such a low scale of colours that the
    <i>light</i> colours, smeared on white paper, for instance,
    would look like ink stains; but on the canvas they stand out
    like lights because of the great forces opposed to them, for
    instance by putting on absolutely unmixed Prussian blue. My own
    criticism is that by paying attention to this, I lost sight of
    the form of the torsos. Heads and hands, however, were done
    very carefully; and as they were of the greatest importance and
    all the rest was nearly entirely dark (therefore <i>quite
    different</i> in effect from the lithograph), my painting the
    picture <i>as I did</i> is to be excused to a greater extent
    than you think. And besides, the real picture differs in design
    from <i>either</i> the rough sketch for it, which I still have
    and which I made in that cottage by the light of a little lamp,
    <i>or</i> from the lithograph.</label></p>

    <p>I want to tell you further that I have drawn quite a number
    of heads since you were here, and quite a lot of peasants
    besides: diggers, weeders, harvesters. The thing that occupied
    my attention, either directly or indirectly, and was the great
    problem in all this, was colour. I mean the <i>breaking</i> of
    the colours - mixing red with green, blue with orange, yellow
    with violet. Always the combination of the complementary
    colours, their influence on each other - which nature is as
    full of as of light and brown. Another problem - which
    engrosses me every day anew - is precisely the one I think you
    asserted I neglected: rendering the form and its modelling, its
    great lines and masses - one considers the contours in the
    <i>last</i> instead of the <i>first</i> place in doing
    this.</p>

    <p>Herewith two sketches of smaller compositions - I painted
    both of them. Lately I have been working mostly on things of a
    smaller size.</p>

    <p>As I go on concentrating my attention on the <i>poor
    peasants</i> especially, I have to cope with the landscape
    every blessed day. When Wenkebach came to see me, I had just
    finished painting some cottages.</p>

    <p>In the matter of wood engravings I have literally nothing
    new except four large compositions by Lhermitte. For me that
    man is Millet the Second, in the <i>full</i> sense of the term;
    I adore his work as much as that of Millet himself. I think his
    genius of the same order as that of Millet the First.</p>

    <p>My brother was here; he told me a few things about the talk
    of the day in Paris now which I think very fortunate - the
    success of the Eugene Delacroix exhibition. I was further
    interested in what he told me about Raffaelli, a figure
    painter, and Claude Monet, a landscape painter cum
    <i>colourist</i>.</p>

    <p>For the rest - you will experience it yourself - it is less
    a <i>golden</i> age than an iron age for painters - I mean, it
    is not exactly easy for them to keep alive - no more than that.
    At least as far as I am concerned it is mis&egrave;re ouverte -
    but despite that my courage, and perhaps my powers too, are
    greater rather than smaller than they were before. Don't think
    you're the only one who considers or considered it his duty to
    criticize me, you know, even to the limits of total
    annihilation; on the contrary, it's about the only thing I have
    encountered so far. For the very reason that you are, or were,
    not the only one to speak in this way and no other, your
    criticism is connected with other criticism to which I on my
    part oppose the conviction that my endeavours have a raison
    d'&ecirc;tre, and to which I shall continue to oppose it more
    and more strongly.</p>

    <p>The reason why - although I did not insist on what I wanted,
    but gave in to what <i>you</i> wanted - the reason why I
    started out by suggesting that you should withdraw your
    criticism completely was not that I wanted to bend or break
    your opinions despotically. Nothing was further from my
    intention, although you took it that way.</p>

    <p>There are details that are quite correct - I have made it
    hot for you on account of plaster-of-Paris drawing, and I
    freely admit that I am capable of doing it again.</p>

    <p>And as for other questions - I cannot always keep quiet
    under it; now and then it seems to me as though people were
    touching my body, so much do I feel taken up by the question,
    and so much is my conviction a part of myself.</p>

    <p>It is true that there are faulty things in that lithograph
    as well as in my other work - certainly there are. But my other
    work proves so clearly that I render what I see that people
    cannot be justified, or speaking in good faith, when they judge
    my work otherwise than as a whole and in a broader way, taking
    into account my purpose and endeavour - namely to paint le
    paysan chez soi, peasants in their surroundings.</p>

    <p>Now you call the aggregate of my work <i>utterly
    weak</i>, and you demonstrate at great length that its
    deficiencies exceed its good qualities.</p>

    <p><i>Thus</i> about my work, <i>thus</i> about my person.</p>

    <p>Well, I <i>won't</i> accept this -
    <i>never</i><i>.</i></p>

    <p>The work in question, the painting of peasants, is such a
    hard job that the <i>utterly weak</i> won't even attempt
    it.</p>

    <p>And at least I have attempted it, and I have laid certain
    foundations, which is not exactly the easiest part of the job!
    And in drawing as well as in painting I can sometimes keep hold
    of certain solid and useful things, a firmer hold than you
    think, amice. But I am always doing <i>what I can't do yet</i>
    in order to learn how to do it. But writing you about this
    bores me. So I'll end by saying that the work is difficult, and
    that, instead of quarreling, the fellows who paint peasants and
    the common people would do wisely to join hands as much as
    possible. Union is strength, and <i>what we have to fight
    against is not each other</i> but those fellows who, even in
    the present period, are obstructing the progress of the ideas
    which Millet and others of a past generation fought for and
    which they pioneered. Nothing is a greater hindrance than this
    fatal fighting among ourselves.</p>

    <p>As for you and me, let's put a stop to it, for our goal is
    the <i>same</i>.</p>

    <p>But my real motive was the wish that your efforts and mine,
    though <i>not identical</i>, should run <i>parallel</i>
    and not in opposite directions. And seeing that in the matter
    of tendency and principle there are enough points of agreement,
    which I think will be permanent, it would appear to me that
    your criticism as a whole - when <i>you applied this criticism
    to me</i> - was inconsistent with the character of your own
    work.</p>

    <p>This much we have in common, that we seek our subjects in
    the heart of the people; and we further have in common a desire
    - either as a <i>final purpose or as a means</i> - to obtain
    our studies from reality. And that means - having <i>much</i>
    in common. And that we are <i>opposed</i> to each other
    <i>basically</i>, with regard either to the technique of
    drawing or the technique of painting, is something I'm not
    convinced of. You are ahead of me in many things, I don't deny
    that; still I think you went too far.</p>

    <p>But, be that as it may, inasmuch as, if we want to and it is
    our earnest endeavor, we may be useful and give support to each
    other - and because union is strength - I deem it desirable for
    us to remain friends.</p>

    <p>And as regards technique, I am still searching for many
    things; and though I happen to find some of them, still there
    are an infinite number of things wanting. But for all that I
    know <i>why I work as I do</i>, and my efforts are planted on
    solid ground.</p>

    <p>I said to Wenkebach only the other day that I did not know
    any painter who had as many faults as I do - but for all that I
    was <i>not</i> convinced that I am radically wrong.</p>

    <p>At times my case is like this: the product of two negatives
    is a <i>positive</i>. Take whatever drawing or study of
    mine you like, especially those that I myself would point out
    to you with a certain resignation, and - in the drawing as well
    as in the colour or the tone - there will be errors that a
    <i>realist would hardly commit</i>...certain inaccuracies which
    I am convinced of myself - and which under certain
    circumstances I could point out with keener discernment than
    others - errors maybe, or imperfections.</p>

    <p>And yet I believe that - even if I go on producing work in
    which people can point out <i>errors</i> - when they want to,
    if this is their special purpose and point of view - it will
    still have a certain vitality and raison d'&ecirc;tre of its
    own that will hurl the errors into the shade - in the eyes of
    those who <i>appreciate</i> character and the spiritual
    conception of things. And it will <i>not</i> be so easy to
    confound me as they think, despite all my faults. I know too
    well what my ultimate goal is, and I am too firmly convinced of
    being on the right road after all, to pay much attention to
    what people say of me - when I want to paint what I feel and
    feel what I paint.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless it makes life difficult at times, and - I think
    it quite possible that later on some fellows will regret either
    the things they said of me or the opposition and indifference
    which they have pestered me with. The way I see it is this: I
    withdraw from people to such an extent that I literally don't
    meet anybody except - the poor peasants - with whom I am
    directly concerned because I paint them.</p>

    <p>And this will remain my policy, and it is quite possible
    that I shall give up my studio before long and go live in a
    peasant's cottage, so as not to hear or see educated people -
    as they call themselves - any longer.</p>

    <p>When I tell you - and I mean it - that I want to remain
    friends with you, it is because I observe in you an endeavour
    which I highly esteem. You penetrate the heart of the common
    people deeply, and you have the will power to carry it through.
    When I say that we may be useful and give support to each
    other, I say so because, if you <i>don't</i> give in to
    convention, you will probably, when you are better known, do
    even <i>bolder</i> things, and then it may come to a regular
    light in which the pictures of one school are used as weapons
    against those of another! And in that case it might be a good
    thing for a number of painters to act in unison On the other
    hand - I don't think it is useless to exchange views and to see
    each other's work.</p>

    <p>Herewith a third little sketch of a study I did yesterday [F
    097, JH 876].</p>

    <p>Goodbye. I felt impelled to submit the remark on the action
    of the woman in the center of your composition to your
    consideration; otherwise I think the composition very sensible
    and the whole conception sympathetic. When you see Wenkebach,
    don't forget to give him my regards.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>From my little sketch you will see that I take rather great
    pains to get action into my little figures, to express their
    being at work, their <i>doing</i> something.</p>

    <p>I think it a good thing that at least <i>one</i> figure in
    your composition is already stooping down - perhaps relatively
    <i>many</i> vertical lines in the composition would make it
    more difficult to express the fact that work is <i>actually in
    progress</i>.</p>
