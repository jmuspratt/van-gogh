  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Now that another week has passed, I am writing you
    again.</p>

    <p>I have had a model regularly, every day from morning until
    evening, and the model is good.</p>

    <p>Mauve has been to see me and Mr. Tersteeg also, and I am
    very glad of it. I have been working all the time now in
    watercolour, and I am getting to like it more and more.</p>

    <p>How I wish you were here, I have so many things to ask and
    tell you. Do you think you will come in the spring? Will you
    know some time in advance?</p>

    <p>What I have done now is far from good, but it is different
    and has more power and freshness, and is without body
    colour.</p>

    <p>Now, I hope you will write me soon, and especially that we
    shall try to make some arrangement about the money. For though
    100 fr. a month would be sufficient for my own expenses, it is
    quite a different matter when I have to pay models daily and
    must feed them, etc., etc. And then the expenses of paint,
    paper, etc. I told you in my last letter that whether I can
    work at full speed or half speed depends on my income.</p>

    <p>Now that I am settled here, small expenses spring up afresh
    every day, which do not make life easy for me at all. However,
    I have worked on regularly for some time, but now I am without
    a cent.</p>

    <p>It is only natural that when one settles somewhere, there
    are all kinds of expenses.</p>

    <p>But in spite of this I am making progress and I shall learn
    to make watercolours, and then it will not be so very long
    before my work becomes saleable.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">Mr. Tersteeg himself said something about it, and if some of
    those smaller ones turn out well, he will probably buy some.</label>
    And I have completed still further the drawing of the little
    old woman which I sent you a sketch of, and someday it will
    surely sell.</p>

    <p>Believe me, I work, I drudge, I grind all day long, and I do
    so with pleasure; but I should get very discouraged if I could
    not go on working as hard or even harder. If you write to Mr.
    Tersteeg about it, he will certainly credit you for an amount
    which you yourself fix, and he can control its expenditure if
    he does not trust me. But it would be terrible if I couldn't go
    on working the way I have these last three weeks.</p>

    <p>As to the size of the drawings or the subjects, I will
    readily listen to Mr. Tersteeg's and Mauve's suggestions. I
    undertook some large ones recently because I wanted by all
    means to get rid of the dryness in last summer's studies. And
    now Mauve said to me last night, though of course he found some
    things to criticize, &ldquo;It is beginning to look like a
    watercolour.&rdquo; Well, if I gain that much, I suppose I've
    wasted neither time nor money. And now that I've tried the use
    of the brush and the strength of the colours on a large scale,
    I can again risk some smaller ones. For that matter, I started
    two small ones, but as I did not get on with them and partly
    washed them out again, I started a very large one, which I'm
    sending you a sketch of.</p>

    <p>So I have enough work for the week that begins tomorrow, but
    I'm afraid I haven't enough money, for 2.50 guilders and a few
    cents is all I have left. What should I do now? If I go and ask
    Mauve or Mr. Tersteeg, I do not think either would refuse me.
    But Mauve has already done so much, and I would rather sell a
    few small drawings to Mr. Tersteeg than borrow money from him.
    So answer me soon, and if possible do something, send me some
    money so that I can go on working. I feel, Theo, that there is
    a power in me, and I do what I can to bring it out and free it.
    All the worry and troubling over my drawings is hard enough,
    and if I had too many other cares and could not pay the models,
    I should lose my head. It is bad enough that you have to pay
    for everything, but things are not so bad as they were last
    winter. I feel that I am nearer success. I shall do what I can,
    I shall work hard, and as soon as I have more power over my
    brush, I shall work even harder than I do now. And if we push
    on energetically now, it will not be long before you need not
    send me money any more.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, do what you can, and I shall also do what I can.
    Adieu. I count on your writing soon; you need not send so much
    at a time if only I can go on from week to week.</p>

    <p>Receive a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
