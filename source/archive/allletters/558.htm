    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">About falling ill, I have already told you that I did not
    think I should, but I'd have fallen ill if my expenditure had
    continued.</label></p>

    <p>For I was terribly uneasy lest I should be forcing you to
    make an effort beyond your strength. On the one hand I thought
    that I could not do better than carry through the thing we had
    begun when persuading Gauguin to join us, and on the other, as
    you may know from experience, when one is furnishing or
    settling down, it is a lot more difficult than one thinks. Now
    I hope to breathe easily at last, since we have all had a
    tremendous stroke of luck in your being able to sell a picture
    for Gauguin. One way or another, all three of us, he and you
    and I, can pull ourselves together enough to realize what we
    have done.</p>

    <p>Do not be afraid that I shall be worried about money. Now
    Gauguin has come, the object is <i>for the moment attained</i>.
    With the two of us sharing expenses, we shan't spend more for
    two than it has cost one to live alone.</p>

    <p>He can even save money in proportion to his selling. It will
    help him, say in a year, to settle in Martinique, which he
    otherwise could not save enough money for.</p>

    <p>You will have my work and also a picture from him every
    month. And I shall do just as much work without having so much
    trouble - so many expenses. Even a long time ago I thought that
    the combination we have just made would be good policy. The
    house is getting on very well indeed, and is becoming not only
    comfortable but an artist's house too.</p>

    <p>So have no fear for me, nor for yourself either.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.guilt">Indeed, I was horribly worried about you, for if Gauguin had
    not come to the same conclusion about it, I should have caused
    you pretty heavy expenses for nothing.</label> But Gauguin is
    astonishing as a man, he does not let himself get out of hand,
    and he will wait here very quietly, working hard, for the right
    moment to take a great step forward. He needs rest as much as I
    do. With the money he has just earned, he certainly could have
    treated himself to a rest cure in Brittany just as well, <i>but
    as things are now, he is sure of being able to wait without
    getting fatally into debt once more</i>. <i>Together</i> we
    shall not spend more than 250 fr. a month. And we shall spend
    <i>much less</i> on paint, since we are going to make it
    ourselves. So on your part, don't be uneasy about us, and have
    a breathing spell too, you need it badly.</p>

    <p>On my part I just want to tell you that I ask only to go on
    at an average rate of 150 a month (and the same for Gauguin).
    In any case that reduces my personal expenses. While his
    pictures are sure to go up.</p>

    <p>After that, if you keep my pictures for yourself, either in
    Paris or here, I should so much rather be able to say bluntly
    that you prefer to keep my work for ourselves and not sell it
    than join in the scuffle for money just now. Honestly. Besides,
    if what I am doing should be good, then we shall lose nothing
    in the money line, for it will mature quietly, like wine in the
    cellar. In another way it is only right that I should take some
    trouble to make a painting such that <i>even</i> from the
    financial point of view it is better that it should be on my
    canvas than in the tubes.</p>

    <p>Now, in conclusion, I venture to hope that in six months
    Gauguin and you and I will all see that we have founded a
    little studio which will last, and which will remain an outpost
    or a way station, necessary or at least useful to all who want
    to see the South.</p>

    <p>I shake your hand firmly.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I do not yet know what Gauguin thinks of my decorations in
    general, I only know that there are already some studies which
    he really likes, like the sower,<art id=0456> the</art> <art id=0458>sunflowers</art>, and <art id=0482>the
    bedroom</art>.</p>

    <p>And as for the whole, I do not in the least know myself yet,
    because I need some more canvases of the other seasons. Gauguin
    has already very nearly found his Arl&eacute;sienne, and I wish
    I had got that far, but for my part it is the landscape that
    comes to me, and I find it varied enough. So after all my
    modest work is going on as usual.</p>

    <p>I venture to think that you will like <art id=0494>the new
    &ldquo;Sower.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>I am writing in haste; we have loads of work to do. He and I
    intend to make a tour of the brothels pretty often, so as to
    study them.</p>
