  <body>
    <p>My dear friend Koning,</p>

    <p>Thanks for having wished me a happy New Year all the way
    from the North of our native country.<label content="health.mental"> I received your postcard
    in the hospital at Arles, where I had been quartered following
    an attack of something the matter with my brains, or otherwise
    fever, which had nearly passed off already.</p>

    <p>And as for the causes and consequences of said illness, I
    think I shall be wise to leave the solving of these problems to
    the casual discussions of the Dutch catechists, that is to say
    whether I am mad or not, or whether I have been mad, and am
    still mad, in some imagination of a purely sculptural
    nature.</p>

    <p>And if not, whether I was already mad before that time; or
    whether I am so at present, or shall be so in the
    hereafter.</label></p>

    <p>After having thus given you ample information with regard to
    the state of my mind and body&hellip;I suppose you will think
    it less miraculous that I did not answer you earlier. Meanwhile
    we must not forget to stick to the point.</p>

    <p>And starting from there I ask you what you are doing in the
    art of painting, and how you are working with the colours.</p>

    <p>As far as I know, I have seen absolutely none of your
    studies which you sent to Theo, in spite of my urgent request
    to you for one of your works. Does the fault lie with Theo, who
    possibly has other things to think of, or with the not
    inconsiderable distance between us?</p>

    <p>Did you know that Theo is engaged, and is going to marry an
    Amsterdam girl within a relatively short time?</p>

    <p>After this question on your work, a few words about
    mine.</p>

    <p>At present I have in mind, or rather <art id=0508>on my easel, the
    portrait of a woman.</p>

    <p>I call it &ldquo;La Berceuse,&rdquo; or as we say in Dutch
    (after Van Eeden, you know, who wrote that particular book I
    gave you to read), or in Van Eeden's Dutch, quite simply
    &ldquo;our lullaby or the woman rocking the cradle.&rdquo; It
    is a woman in a green dress (the bust olive green and grey
    skirt pale malachite green).</art></p>

    <p>The hair is quite orange and in plaits. The complexion is
    chrome yellow, worked up with some naturally broken tones for
    the purpose of modelling.</p>

    <p>The hands holding the rope of the cradle, the same.</p>

    <p>At the bottom the background is vermilion (simply
    representing a tiled floor or else a stone floor). The wall is
    covered with wallpaper, which of course I have calculated in
    conformity with the rest of the colours. This wallpaper is
    bluish-green with pink dahlias and spotted with orange and
    ultramarine.</p>

    <p>In this I think I have run pretty well parallel with Van
    Eeden and his style of writing, which consequently can be
    considered analogous to my style of painting in the matter of
    colours.</p>

    <p>Whether I really sang a lullaby in colours is something I
    leave to the critics, particularly to the aforesaid ones.</p>

    <p>But we talked all this over sufficiently at the time, didn't
    we? I mean the eternal problem of colours, which leads us on as
    far as our tranquillity of mind will allow.</p>

    <p>At any rate, on leaving the hospital, I made <art id=0500>a portrait of
    my own doctor</art>. And I haven't wholly lost my
    equilibrium as a painter.</p>

    <p>But of course, from that time onward I have painted quite a
    considerable number of studies or pictures. Among other things,
    last summer, <art id=0456>two flower pieces with nothing but sunflowers in a
    yellow earthen pot</art>. <art id=0454>Painted with the three chrome yellows,
    yellow ocher and malachite green, and nothing else.</art></p>

    <p>For the time being I am staying on in Arles, and keeping
    myself at your disposal in the matter of correspondence or
    painted studies. Not long ago Theo went to see Breitner, and
    discussing his work, he told me that after all he considered
    Breitner the best painter and thinker over there.</p>

    <p>Good-by, amice, with a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Your friend, Vincent</p>

    <p>The address is still Place Lamartine 2, Arles.</p>

    <p>Should you meet Breitner, you have my permission to let him
    read this letter or tell him of it. I mean as I write it, and
    without letting your powers of imagination run away with you
    too much.</p>
