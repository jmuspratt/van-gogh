    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You will quite forgive me when you know that I wrote my last
    letter in a moment of spleen. My drawings went all wrong, and
    not knowing what to do, I began to write. I certainly ought to
    have waited for a better moment, and this will show you that I
    myself undoubtedly belong to that class of people of which I
    spoke in my last letter, namely, that class of people who do
    not always reflect on what they say or do. This being so, let
    us drop it.</p>

    <p>I can tell you one thing; during these last days there has
    been a change for the better. I have finished at least a dozen
    drawings, or rather sketches in pencil and in pen and ink,
    which seem to me to be somewhat better. They vaguely resemble
    certain drawings by Lan&ccedil;on, or certain English wood
    engravings, but as yet they are more clumsy and awkward. They
    represent a porter, a miner, a snow shoveller, a walk in the
    snow, old women, a type of old man (&ldquo;Ferragus&rdquo; from
    Balzac's L'histoire des treize), etc. I am sending you two
    small ones, &ldquo;En Route&rdquo; and &ldquo;Devant les
    Tisons&rdquo; [In front of the wood fire]. I see perfectly well
    that they are not good, but they are beginning to look like
    something.</p>

    <p>I have a model almost every day, an old porter, or some
    working man, or some boy, who poses for me. Next Sunday perhaps
    one or two soldiers will sit for me. And because now I am no
    longer in a bad humour, I have quite a different and better
    opinion of you, and of the world in general. Also I have again
    drawn a landscape - a heath - a thing I had not done for a long
    time.</p>

    <p>I love landscape very much, but I love ten times more those
    studies from life, sometimes of startling realism, which have
    been drawn so masterfully by Gavarni, Henri Monnier, Daumier,
    De Lemud, Henri Pille, Th. Schuler, Ed. Morin, G. Dor&eacute;
    (e.g. in his &ldquo;London&rdquo;), A. Lan&ccedil;on, De Groux,
    F&eacute;licien Rops, etc., etc. Now without in the least
    pretending to compare myself to those artists, still, by
    continuing to draw those types of working people, etc., I hope
    to arrive at the point of being able to illustrate papers and
    books. Especially when I am able to take more models, also
    female models, I shall make more progress - I feel it, and know
    it. And I shall also probably learn to make portraits. But the
    condition is to work hard, &ldquo;Not a day without a
    line,&rdquo; as Gavarni said.</p>

    <p>So it is understood that for the present I shall stay here,
    till you perhaps find something better for me. Only write me
    now and then. I am for the moment busy drawing for the third
    time all the Exercices au Fusain by Bargue.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">You told me of a change in the staff of the house Goupil
    &amp; Co., and also of another change in your own position. I
    congratulate you, and as to those gentlemen Goupil &amp; Co.,
    I am inclined to believe that they are to be congratulated on
    having got rid of some of the staff. I have always thought that
    those gentlemen themselves were animated by a superior and
    nobler spirit than that of those who have now left. Perhaps the
    position the latter have occupied so long in the firm, the
    influence and domination, which Messrs. Goupil &amp; Co. put up
    with, were repugnant to some of the other employees, whom the
    company would perhaps have done better to retain, but who were
    so driven to extremes that they resigned.</label></p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">As you vaguely spoke to me some time ago about coming to
    Paris, I must tell you that I wish no better than to go someday
    soon, provided I were sure of finding some work there which
    would give me a salary of at least 100 fr. a month. I must also
    tell you that as I have begun to draw, I do not intend to drop
    it, so I will try chiefly to get on in that line. Not only does
    drawing figures and scenes from life demand a knowledge of the
    technique of drawing, but it also demands profound studies of
    literature, physiognomy, etc., which are difficult to
    acquire.</label></p>

    <p>Enough for today; write me when you have a moment to spare,
    and believe me, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>72 Bd. du Midi</p>

    <p>Someday I hope to go to see Mr. Horta.</p>
