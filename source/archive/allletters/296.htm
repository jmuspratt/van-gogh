  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is true that I have written you often lately, but my
    letters harp so much on the same thing that I am angry with
    myself for not writing you in a somewhat more amusing way. It
    will come back someday - I think that when you have been in the
    studio again, there will be more animating subjects to write
    about. At least I hope so, and there will be, if you feel
    sympathy for what I am doing and what you have not yet
    seen.</p>

    <p>This week I saw in Paris Illustr&eacute; a fine reproduction
    of a drawing by Ulysse Butin, &ldquo;La Mise &agrave;
    l'Eau.&rdquo; Fishermen and women pushing a boat into the sea.
    I saw it at the very time when I happened to be thinking of
    Butin and of Legros, while I was drudging on a thing with a
    subject quite different from what they make, namely those
    kneeling potato diggers working with their short-handled forks;
    not long ago I wrote you about making studies of them. I now
    have a sketch of it on the easel with <art id=1034>four figures, three men
    and a woman</art>. I want something broad and
    audacious, with silhouette and relief in it. That is what I am
    seeking more and more.</p>

    <p>I always remember the strong impression made on me by the
    first picture of Butin's I saw (one of his later ones). It was
    the one which he himself made an etching of later. I think it
    is called &ldquo;The Jetty,&rdquo; women on the lookout for
    boats which are expected to come into port on a stormy night.
    That was the first one I saw of his, and since then I have seen
    the one at the Luxembourg and several others.</p>

    <p>I find him very honest and serious, and I believe that just
    when it seems he has drawn with a hasty hand, his drawing has
    remained apr&egrave;s tout no less reasonable and correct. He
    is one of the men I do not know personally, and yet when I see
    his work, I can imagine how he did it.</p>

    <p>Don't you like Blommers's picture at the salon,
    &ldquo;November&rdquo;? I didn't see the picture, only the
    reproduction. I think it looks exactly like a Butin, and it has
    more passion (and something dramatic) than Blommers's pictures
    usually have.</p>

    <p>Right now I am working on no less than seven or eight
    drawings of about a meter in size, so you can imagine that I am
    up to my ears in work.</p>

    <p>But I hope so much that my hand will become more skillful
    from this long period of drudgery.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">So, for instance, my dislike for working with charcoal is
    disappearing more every day. One reason for this is that I have
    found a way to fix the charcoal and then work over it, for
    instance, with printer's ink.</label></p>

    <p><?showImage("351_V-T_2960");?>
     Here follows a little sketch of potato diggers, but on the
    drawing they are sitting a little wider apart.</p>

    <p>As I write you, I think of that evening - perhaps you
    remember it, though it is years ago - when you and I together
    spent an evening with Mauve, when he was still living near the
    barracks, and he gave us a photograph of a drawing of his, a
    plough.</p>

    <p>Little did I dream at the time that I myself should become a
    draughtsman, nor could I think at the time that difficulties
    would ever arise between Mauve and me.</p>

    <p>I always wonder at our not having made up, the more so
    because really, if one considers it thoroughly, there is hardly
    any difference of opinion between us. However, it is so long
    ago now that my good spirits with regard to my work and the
    confidence that it will come out right after all are beginning
    to return. I have experienced that before, notwithstanding
    everything, but one can't help getting upset and having a
    melancholy feeling when such persons disapprove of it or say
    that you are on the wrong track.</p>

    <p>Will you write soon? As always, your letter will be welcome.
    Can you believe that it is not at all easier to draw a figure
    of about a foot high than to draw a small one? <i>On the
    contrary</i>, it is much more difficult, and getting it in that
    size, yet in proportion as strong as the little figures, is
    sometimes hard work, I assure you. Adieu, boy, have a good time
    and good luck in business. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
