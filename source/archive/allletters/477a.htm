    <p>[This letter to John Russell was written in English, and is
    reproduced without alterations.]</p>

    <p>My dear Russell,</p>

    <p>I ought to have answered your letter ever so long ago, but
    working pretty hard every day, at night I feel so often too
    weary to write. As it rains today I avail myself of the
    opportunity. Last Sunday I have met MacKnight and a Danish
    painter, and I intend to go to see him at Fonvieille next
    Monday. I feel sure I shall prefer him as an artist to what he
    is as an art critic, his views as such being so narrow that
    they make me smile.</p>

    <p>I heartily hope for you that you will be able to leave Paris
    for good soon and no doubt leaving Paris will do you a world of
    good in all respects. As for me I remain enraptured with the
    scenery here, am working at a series of blooming orchards. And
    involuntarily I thought often of you because you did the same
    in Sicily. I wished you would one day or another when I shall
    send over some work to Paris exchange a Sicilian study with me
    - in case you should have one to spare.</p>

    <p>You know I thought and think such a deal of those of yours.
    I don't gainsay that your portraits are more serious and higher
    art, but I think it meritory in you and a rare quality that
    together with a perfection as appeared to me the Fabian and
    McKnight portraits you are at the same time able to give a
    Scherzo, the adagio con expressione, the gay note, in one word
    together with more manly conceptions of a higher order. And I
    so Heartily hope that you will continue to give us
    simultan&eacute;ment both the grave and elaborate works and
    those aforesaid scherzos. Then let them say if they like that
    you are not always serious or that you have done work of a
    lighter sort - So much the worse for the critics and so much
    better for you.</p>

    <p>I have heard nothing of our friend Mr. Reid. I felt rather
    anxious on his account because I feel sure he was on a false
    track. My brother has received a letter from him but pretty
    unsatisfactory.</p>

    <p>I was very much taken in by him during the first six weeks
    or two months, but after that period he was in pecuniary
    difficulties and in the same acted in a way that made on me the
    impression that he had lost his wits.</p>

    <p>Which I still think was the case and consequently he not
    responsible even if his doings then were pretty unfair. He is
    very nervous - as we all are - and can't help being so. - He is
    prompted to act in his crisis of nerves to make
    money&hellip;whilst painters would make pictures&hellip;</p>

    <p>So much to say that I consider the dealer stronger in him
    than the artist though there be a battle in his conscience
    concerning this - of the which battle I do not yet know the
    result. So much - pour votre gouverne - as I had the pleasure
    of introducing him to you [I] feel bound to warn you with the
    same sympathy however for him, because I found him artistic in
    pleading the Monticelli cause. In the which I took and take my
    part. Witnessing the very scenery which inspired Monticelli I
    maintain this artist has rights to public though too late
    appreciation. Surely Monticelli gives us not, neither pretends
    to give us, local colour or even local truth. But gives us
    something passionate and eternal - the rich colour and rich sun
    of the glorious South in a true colourist way parrallel with
    Delacroix' conception of the South viz. that the South be
    represented now by contraste simultan&eacute; of colours and
    their derivations and harmonies and not by forms and lines in
    themselves as the ancient artists did formerly, by pure form
    Greeks &amp; Michel Ange or by pure line or delineation Rafael
    Mantegna, Venetian primitives (Botticelli Cimabue Giotto
    Bellini).</p>

    <p>Contrariwise the thing undertaken by P. Veronese &amp;
    Titian - colour. The thing undertaken by Velasquez and Goya to
    be continued and - more fully or rather more universally done
    by the more universal knowledge we have and possess of the
    prism and their properties.</p>

    <p>Hoping to write you again and to hear of you pretty
    soon!</p>

    <p>Yours very truly, Vincent</p>
