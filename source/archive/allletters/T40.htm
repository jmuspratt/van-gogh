    <p>Letter T40<br>
     Paris, 3 July 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter. Happily, mine contains good
    news of the little one. After some days of suffering he is
    beginning to be merry again and not to cry so much. This is due
    to the good ass's milk we are giving him now. The animals come
    to the door, and in the morning he gets warm milk, always
    from the same animal. After that there remains enough for two
    portions which he gets alternately with his mother's milk,
    which is now coming in abundance. At the moment he is
    looking very well.</p>

    <p>It is necessary for him to take ass's milk for at least 15
    days, so we shall not be able to go visit Pissarro on July 14.
    Therefore I have reserved this day to go see Claude Monet
    with Valadon, who will be sure to annoy me that day, but I am
    glad to be going to see the new works by Monet.</p>

    <p>There is no reason for you to put off your
    visit - not that we didn't appreciate your willingness to come
    share our troubles; on the contrary; many thanks for that, but
    with a patient in the house the fewer visitors the better. So
    come if you want on Sunday by the first train; in the morning you
    will see Walpole Brook, who has just seen your paintings at
    Tangui's. Afterwards we are going to look at a Japanese
    Buddha that I have seen at a curio dealer's, and then will lunch at
    home and look at your studies with you. You can stay with us as
    long as you like, and you can advise us with regard to
    the arrangement of our new apartment.</p>

    <p>Probably Dries and Annie will take the ground
    floor, and they will have a little garden, which we shall make
    good use of, of course. If the two women can hit it off, it
    promises well. It is quite possible that Dries will join us. I
    have been quite lucky in business, although my painting sales
    do not amount to 800,000,000,000 frs., but among other
    things I have sold two Gauguins, for which I sent him the
    money. Pissarro wrote to tell me that he could not pay his
    rent; I shall send him a little advance upon the business we
    are going to do. It is true, his exhibition brought in
    something, but it is only enough to plug the leaks. He has an
    abscess in one eye. Poor old fellow.</p>

    <p>Good-by, brother, we count on seeing you on Sunday.
    Kindest regards from Jo, and the little one is smiling as
    before his illness. A cordial handshake from your brother who
    loves you.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>

    <p>Regards to Dr. Gachet and family.</p>

    <p>The sketch of the landscape in the manner of Michel is
    promising [JH 2039], and the portrait must be superb.</p>
