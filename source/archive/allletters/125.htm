    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I enclose a little word in Father's letter to say good
    morning to you. It is raining outside, as it has been doing
    often lately, and it is stormy too.</p>

    <p>I wrote to the Reverend Mr. de Jonge that I am ready to go
    at once to Brussels whenever work or duty calls, but if there
    is no urgent reason for my coming immediately, I should like to
    stay a week longer here (because of Anna's wedding) and then
    arrive on Sunday 25<sup>th</sup> August.</p>

    <p>I wonder if the exhibition of pictures there will still be
    open then - I should like very much to see it. I am eager to
    hear from you. I hope to write you more as soon as I am in
    Brussels; also about the exhibition - at least if it isn't
    already closed.</p>

    <p>My compliments to Braat and Soek when you see them. &Agrave;
    Dieu, have a good time. We speak about you at home every day.
    Write again soon, and receive a warm handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
