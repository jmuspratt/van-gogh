  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I had been more or less on the lookout for your letter and
    was very pleased when it came. Many thanks for it.</p>

    <p>What you write about the exhibition is very interesting.
    Which old painting by Dupr&eacute; was it that you particularly
    liked so much? You must tell me when you next write. Your
    description of the Troyon and the Rousseau, for instance, has
    enough substance for me to get a fair idea of the way in which
    they are done.</p>

    <p>There are other pictures from about the time of Troyon's
    Pr&eacute; Communal that had the sort of atmosphere one might
    call <i>dramatic</i>, although there are no figures in
    them. Isra&euml;ls got it quite right when he said of a Jules
    Dupr&eacute; (Mesdag's large one), &ldquo;It is like a
    figure-painting,&rdquo; and it is this dramatic effect that
    lends the je ne sais quoi which makes one feel what you say
    about it: &ldquo;It conveys that moment and that place in
    nature to which one can repair alone, without company.&rdquo;
    Ruysdael's &ldquo;Buisson&rdquo; has it very strongly as
    well.</p>

    <p>You must have seen those old Jacques in which it was
    slightly exaggerated, perhaps done slightly for effect - no,
    not really - which one used to admire for that very reason,
    even though the ordinary man in the street didn't rate them
    among Jacque's finest.</p>

    <p>Speaking of Rousseau, do you know the Richard Wallace
    Rousseau, a lisi&eacute;re de bois [edge of a wood] in autumn
    after the rain, a glimpse of meadows stretching endlessly into
    the distance, marshy, with cattle, the foreground very much in
    tone. To me that is one of the finest - very much like the one
    of the red sun in the Luxembourg. The dramatic effect in those
    paintings is something that, more than anything else in art,
    makes one understand &ldquo;une coin de la nature vu &agrave;
    travers d'un temperament&rdquo; [a corner of nature viewed
    through (the medium of) a temperament] and l'homme
    ajout&eacute; &agrave; la nature [man added to nature]. One
    finds the same thing in, say, portraits by Rembrandt. It is
    more than nature, something of a revelation. And it seems to me
    that it is as well to have great respect for it and to hold
    one's tongue when, as so often, people say it is exaggerated or
    mannered.</p>

    <p>Oh, I must tell you that De Bock has been to see me - rather
    enjoyable. Breitner, who was totally unexpected because he
    seemed to have broken contact completely at one time, turned up
    yesterday. I was pleased, because - when I first moved here -
    it used to be very agreeable going out with him. I don't mean
    going out into the country but going out to look for characters
    and enjoyable experiences in the city itself. There isn't
    another person here in The Hague with whom I have ever done
    this, most find the city ugly and give everything in it a miss.
    And yet the city can be very beautiful at times, too, don't you
    agree?</p>

    <p>Yesterday, for instance, I saw workmen in the Noordeinde
    busy pulling down the section opposite the palace. Men all
    white with plaster dust, with carts and horses. It was chilly,
    windy weather, a grey sky, the whole place full of
    character.</p>

    <p>I met Van der Velden last year - one evening at De Bock's
    when we were looking at De B.'s etchings. I wrote to you then
    that he made a very favorable impression on me, although he had
    little to say and wasn't very good company that evening. But
    the immediate impression he made on me was that he is a solid,
    genuine painter. He has a square, Gothic head, - a touch of
    insolence or boldness and yet gentleness in his look, a sturdy,
    broad build, in fact the exact opposite of Breitner and De
    Bock. There is something virile and powerful about him, even
    though he doesn't say or do anything in particular. I hope to
    have closer contacts with him one day - perhaps through Van der
    Weele.</p>

    <p>I was at Van der Weele's last Sunday. He was working on a
    picture of cattle in the milking-yard, for which he's done a
    number of substantial studies. He is going to the country now
    for a while.</p>

    <p>By way of a change I did a few watercolours again in the
    countryside recently, <art id=1037>a little cornfield and a bit of a potato
    field.</art> And I have also drawn a few small landscapes as settings
    for a couple of figure drawings I am hoping to do.</p>

    <p><?showImage("355_V-T_2990");?>
     These are the designs for those figure drawings, very sketchy.
    <art id=1035a>The top one is of people burning weeds</art>, the bottom one shows
    the return from the potato fields. I am seriously thinking of
    painting a number of figure studies, chiefly with a view to
    working up the drawings.</p>

    <p>What happy news that you plan to come to Holland at the
    beginning of August; as I've told you often enough, I look
    forward to seeing you very much.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">I'm eager to hear from you how well up your woman is in
    artistic matters. I imagine in any case that much still remains
    to be done and encouraged in that direction. Tant mieux. In any
    case, I hope she will acquire some sort of scrapbook, for which
    I hope you will be able to find a few sheets from among the
    smaller studies. Sometimes there are sheets in a sketchbook
    which, although they are mere scribbles, nevertheless have
    something to say. I shall put a few things aside against her
    arrival.</label></p>

    <p>I have talked it over with De Bock and I can store my things
    at his house when I do my studies in Scheveningen. I also hope
    to call on Blommers again in the near future. I spoke to De
    Bock about his painting at the Salon, &ldquo;November,&rdquo;
    the reproduction of which I admired so much in the catalogue.
    He must still have a sketch of it, and I should like to see
    that.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">As for my going to London sooner or later, for a shorter or
    longer period, I agree there would be a better chance of doing
    something with my work over there. I also think that I could
    learn quite a lot if I could meet some of the people there. And
    I assure you I would not be short of subjects. There are bound
    to be beautiful things to do there at those dockyards on the
    Thames!</label></p>

    <p>Anyway, there are several matters we must talk over when you
    come. I hope you won't be in too much of a hurry, there is so
    much we should discuss.</p>

    <p>I really wish I could go to Brabant again in the autumn and
    do some studies there. I should particularly like to have some
    studies of a Brabant plough, of a weaver and of the village
    churchyard at Nuenen. But again, everything costs money.</p>

    <p>Well, regards, and many thanks again for your letter and the
    enclosure. Look after yourself. Are you thinking of bringing
    your woman along to Holland or isn't that advisable yet? I wish
    you would.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, my dear fellow, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I am adding a few lines to tell you some more about Breitner
    - I have just returned from his temporary studio here (as you
    know, he lives in Rotterdam at present). You no doubt know
    Vierge, or Urabietta, who draws for L'Illustration<i>?</i>
    Well, at times Breitner reminds me of Vierge, though not very
    often.</p>

    <p>When he is good, his work looks like something done in a
    hurry by Vierge, but when he, that is B., does work that is too
    hurried or unfinished, which is what happens most of the time,
    then it is hard to say what it looks like, because it doesn't
    look like anything - unless it is strips of faded old wallpaper
    from I don't know what period, but anyway a most peculiar and
    probably very distant one. Just picture the scene, as I step
    into his garret at Siebenhaar's. It has been furnished in the
    main with various (empty) matchboxes, and for the rest with a
    razor or the like and a box with a bed in it. I could see
    things standing against the chimney, 3 endlessly long strips,
    which I took at first for sun blinds. But on closer inspection
    they turned out to be canvases</p>

    <p><?showImage("355_V-T_2991");?>
     in this format:</p>

    <p>As you see from the above illustration, the first one is a
    somewhat mystical scene, probably taken from Revelation, or so
    one might be inclined to think at first. But I am told it is
    artillery manoeuvers in the dunes. My considered opinion is
    that it is a good 4 meters long by &frac34; meter broad.</p>

    <p>The second one tells the story of a man leaning against a
    wall at the extreme left of the painting; while at the extreme
    right various ghostly female specimens stand gaping at him,
    care having been taken to leave a fair amount of space between
    these two groups. And I was also told that the man on the left
    was meant to represent a drunkard, which might well have been
    the painter's intention, and I have no wish to call that into
    question, though it could have been anything else.</p>

    <p>The third one is almost better, and is a sketch of the
    market place he did last year, which seems, however, to have
    changed since then to represent a Spanish rather than a Dutch
    market, at least in so far as anything can be made out in it at
    all. What sort of wares are being sold in that market, where it
    may be - I, for my part, doubt it is meant to be on this globe,
    and to the naive spectator it would seem rather to represent a
    scene on one of the planets that Jules Verne's miraculous
    travellers were in the habit of visiting (by projectile). It is
    impossible to be specific about the sort of wares actually
    being sold, though seen from afar it could be enormous
    quantities of candied fruit or sweetmeats.</p>

    <p>Now, you try to imagine something like that, but on ne peut
    plus absurd [as absurd as can be] and heavy-handed to boot, and
    you have the work of friend Breitner. From a distance it looks
    like patches of faded colour on a bleached, mouldering and
    mildewy wallpaper and in that respect it has some qualities,
    which to me are none the less positively objectionable.</p>

    <p>I simply fail to comprehend how it is possible for anyone to
    produce such things. They are like something seen in a fever,
    impossible and meaningless as in the most preposterous
    dream.</p>

    <p>I think it just shows that Breitner hasn't yet fully
    recovered and that he actually did do it while he was feverish,
    which in view of his illness last year is quite on the
    cards.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.insomnia">Last year, when I had recovered but couldn't sleep and was
    feverish myself, </label>I too had moments when I felt like forcing
    myself to do some work, and I did do a few things, but thank
    God not too absurdly large, which later I couldn't believe I
    had done. That's why I believe B. will be all right again, but
    I do find this stuff ridiculous.</p>

    <p>A watercolour study of some small birch trees in the dunes,
    which was much better and had nothing abnormal about it, lay
    crumpled in a corner. But his large things are no good.</p>

    <p>At Van der Weele's I saw another very ugly one by him, as
    well as a very good head, but a portrait of Van der Weele he
    had started was another bad one. Thus he is hard at it making a
    fine old mess and on a very large scale. I do at times like the
    work of Hoffmann and Edgar Poe (the Fantastic Tales<i>,</i>
    Raven, etc.) but I find Breitner's stuff objectionable because
    the imagination behind it is clumsy and meaningless and has
    virtually no contact with reality. I think it's terribly ugly.
    But I look on it as the result of a spell of ill-health. Van
    der Weele also has two rather curious little watercolours of
    his, stylishly done, which have a touch, a certain je ne sais
    quoi, of what the English call &ldquo;weird.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I learned a lesson today thanks to that visit, namely that
    one is fortunate indeed if in present-day society one can live
    in fairly normal surroundings and has no need to resort to a
    coffee-house existence - from which one starts to see things
    through a growing fog of confusion. For I have no doubt that
    this is what happened to him. Imperceptibly he has strayed far
    from a composed and rational view of things, and so long as
    this nervous exhaustion persists he will be unable to produce a
    single composed, sensible line or brushstroke.</p>

    <p>I wish I could provide him with some company and diversion,
    I wish I could share his ups and downs more often and perhaps
    cultivate his friendship a bit more. Do you remember the
    painting La folie d'Hugues v. d. Goes, by Wauters? In some
    respects Breitner reminds me a little of v. d. Goes's mental
    state. I don't want to be the first here to say so, but I
    believe that people have been talking along these lines about
    his work for quite some time now.</p>

    <p>The cure for him would be to take a good long look at some
    potato plants, which have lately had such a deep and
    distinctive colour and tone, instead of driving himself mad
    looking at pieces of yellow satin and bits of gold leather.
    Well, we shall have to wait and see. He is intelligent enough,
    but he persists quand m&ecirc;me [all the same] with a sort of
    eccentric parti pris [prejudice]. If he were merely departing
    from normality with a rational motive, well and good, but with
    him it is also a question of no longer taking trouble with his
    work. I think it is a very bad business and just hope he will
    come out of it all right, but he has badly lost his way.</p>

    <p>Well, I shall be making a start in Scheveningen this week. I
    could have done with a little extra to buy some painting
    material.</p>

    <p>I am going to have a few drawings photographed in cabinet
    size [6.5 x 4.5 inches] or a little larger (to see how they
    will look on a smaller scale) by a photographer who has taken
    photographs of drawings by Ter Meulen, Duch&acirc;tel and
    Zilcken. He does it for 75 cents, which isn't expensive, is it?
    I shall have him do &ldquo;The Sower&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Peat
    Cutters&rdquo; for now, the one with a lot of small figures,
    the other with 1 large figure. And if those come off, then if I
    should later have any drawings I shall be able to send you
    photographs of them, which you could show to, say, Buhot, to
    see if he thinks he can find buyers. They could reproduce those
    they want from the actual drawings, or else I could copy them
    onto their paper.</p>

    <p>Regards once again, Theo, all the best. Write again soon. I
    am having those photographs done because we must keep going
    after Buhot &amp; C<sup>ie</sup>, I must earn a bit of money so
    that I can start something new and also do some painting, as I
    am just in the mood for it now.</p>

    <p>Mauve has fallen out not just with me but also, to name but
    one other, with Zilcken. The other day I saw Zilcken's etchings
    and just now at the photographer's I saw photographs of
    Zilcken's drawings. Leaving myself out of it, I must say that,
    going by those, it is beyond me what Mauve has against Zilcken.
    His drawings were good, not bad at all. It's just
    capriciousness on Mauve's part.</p>

    <p>After all, I don't think it's very nice of C. M. never to
    have sent one syllable in answer to my letter, when I took the
    trouble to enclose two sketches of the drawings in
    question.</p>

    <p>Nor do I think it nice of H. G. T., now that I, for my part,
    have tried to thaw the ice between us, not to come to see me.
    It's stuff and nonsense to say he's busy, for that isn't the
    reason, he could easily find the time to come round <i>once</i>
    a year.</p>

    <p>I am adding another half-page to say something about
    Brabant. Among the figures I've done of working types there are
    several with what many would call a distinctly old-fashioned
    character, even in conception, for instance a digger who looks
    more like those one occasionally comes across on the carved
    wooden bas-reliefs of Gothic church pews than on a modern
    drawing. I think of the Brabant figures very often because I
    find them particularly appealing.</p>

    <p>What I should tremendously like to do, and what I feel I
    could do, too, on the understanding that circumstances made
    patient posing possible, is the small figure of Father on a
    path across the heath; the figure rigorously drawn, with
    character, and as I have said, on a stretch of brown heathland
    crossed by a narrow white sandy path and a sky applied and
    suggested with just a touch of passion. In addition, Father and
    Mother arm in arm, let's say - in autumnal surroundings - or
    against a small beech hedgerow with withered leaves. I should
    also like to use Father's figure when I do a peasant funeral,
    which I fully intend to try, although it won't be easy.</p>

    <p>Leaving aside less relevant differences in religious
    opinion, the figure of a poor village clergyman is for me, in
    type and character, one of the most sympathetic there is, and I
    would not be who I am if I didn't tackle it some day.</p>

    <p>When you come, I should very much like to consult you about
    arrangements for a trip there. When you see my drawings of
    orphan men, for instance, you will understand what I want and
    how I intend to set about it.</p>

    <p>I want to do a drawing that not quite everybody will
    understand, the figure simplified to the essentials, with a
    deliberate disregard of those details that do not belong to the
    actual character and are merely accidental. That is, it mustn't
    be, say, a portrait of Father, but rather depict the type of a
    poor village clergyman on his way to visit the sick. Similarly,
    the couple arm in arm by the beech hedge will be a typical
    husband-and-wife who have grown old together in love and
    fidelity, rather than portraits of Father and Mother, although
    I hope that they will pose for it. But they will have to
    understand that it is a serious matter, which they might
    perhaps not realize if the likeness isn't exact. And so they
    will have to be gently warned that if it comes off, they will
    have to adopt the pose I choose and not change it. Anyhow, it
    should turn out all right, and I don't work so slowly that it
    need be a big effort for them. And I for my part should set
    great store by doing it.</p>

    <p>The simplification of figures is something that greatly
    preoccupies me. Anyway, you will see it for yourself in the
    figures I'll be showing you. Should I go to Brabant, then I
    don't think it should be some sort of an outing or a pleasure
    trip, but a short period of very hard work done at -lightning
    speed.</p>

    <p>Speaking of expression in a figure, I am increasingly coming
    round to the idea that it lies less in the features than in the
    whole tournure [bearing]. There are few things I detest more
    than most of the academic t&ecirc;tes d'expression [facial
    expressions] - I would sooner look at Michelangelo's Night or a
    drunkard by Daumier or Millet's diggers and that well-known big
    woodcut of his, &ldquo;The Shepherdess&rdquo; - or an old horse
    by Mauve, etc.</p>
