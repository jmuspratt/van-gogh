  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You will understand that I am longing to hear from you
    whether you have read my letter. As for myself, I think the
    cheapest way will be the most reasonable one for me under the
    circumstances - I think I shall have to move to a village.</p>

    <p>If you can continue to send the 150 francs a month, I think
    it will be almost or entirely sufficient.</p>

    <p>Dear brother, there doesn't seem to be a little more ease in
    store for me. I will try not to complain, I will bear what I
    can.</p>

    <p>Though I stick to my conviction that my work really demands
    more, and that I also ought to be able to spend a little more
    on food and other necessities, if I must do with less, so be
    it. After all, my life is perhaps not worth the money, why
    should I worry about it? And it's really nobody's fault,
    neither is it my own.</p>

    <p>But I hope you will be convinced of one thing - that it is
    impossible to do more than stint oneself even in food, clothes,
    every comfort, every necessity. When one has skimped in
    everything, there can be no question of unwillingness, can
    there? You know very well that if somebody said to me, Do this
    or that, make a drawing of this or that, I should not refuse,
    yes, I would even make several trials with pleasure if the
    first one did not succeed. But nobody has said it - or only so
    vaguely, so generally, that it puts me out rather than helps
    me.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">As for my clothes, dear brother, I put on what was given me,
    without wanting more, without asking for more. I have worn
    clothes I got from Father and from you, which sometimes do not
    fit me the way they ought to because of the difference in our
    sizes. If you will drop the matter of defects in my attire, I
    shall remain content with what I have, and even be grateful for
    little, though of course later I hope to remind you of it and
    say, &ldquo;Theo, do you remember the time when I walked about
    in a long clergyman's coat of Father's?&rdquo; etc. It seems to
    me that it is infinitely better to take things as they are
    <i>now</i>, and laugh over them later, when we have made our
    way, rather than quarrel about them now.</p>

    <p>For the moment I have the suit you brought for me to wear
    when I go out, and more things that are still quite
    presentable. But you must excuse my not putting them on in the
    studio or when I work out-of-doors - it would be spoiling them
    recklessly, for one always gets some stains on one's clothes
    while painting, especially if one tries to catch an effect even
    in rain and storm.</label></p>

    <p>My idea about earning money is as simple as can be - it is
    that it must come through my work, and that nothing can be
    gained by going to speak to people about it.</p>

    <p>Yet whenever there is a chance, I try to catch it - as, for
    instance, what I told you about Belinfante, about Smulders, but
    up to now fortune has favoured me but little. Well, never mind,
    if only you do not upset me by suspecting me of
    unwillingness.</p>

    <p>For I think if you consider things seriously, you will not
    doubt my working hard, and besides, if you should insist on my
    going to ask people to buy from me, <i>I would do so</i>, but
    <i>in that case</i> I should perhaps get melancholy.</p>

    <p>If possible, let me go on as I have up to now. If not, and
    if you want me to take my work around to different people, I
    shall not refuse to do so if you think it better.</p>

    <p>But, brother dear, human brains cannot bear everything;
    there is a limit. Look at Rappard, who got brain fever, and had
    to travel as far as Germany to recover. Trying to go and speak
    to people about my work makes me more nervous than is good for
    me. And what is the result? Rejection, or being put off with
    fair promises. It would not make me nervous if it were you, for
    instance - you know me and I am used to speaking with you.</p>

    <p>I assure you, I feel less energy for my work when I have
    been among people. If we do not lose time now because of that
    kind of thing, we'll make slow but sure progress, and I do not
    know a better way. In no case would I refuse any serious order,
    whether to my liking or not. I would try to do it the way it is
    wanted - do it over again if necessary.</p>

    <p>Well, I have made up my mind <i>in no case</i> to become
    impatient, even if people purposely put obstacles in my
    way.</p>

    <p>I cannot say more than that, and if you were to order
    something yourself, you could make more than one trial. I am at
    your disposal.</p>

    <p>I think there is a difference between now and the past. In
    the years gone by there used to be more passion both in making
    and in judging work. They deliberately chose this or that
    direction, they energetically took the part of one or the
    other. There was more animation. I think now there is a spirit
    of capriciousness and satiety; people are generally more
    lukewarm. For my part, I already wrote you some time ago that
    it seemed to me that there had been a sharp decline since
    Millet, as if the top had already been reached and decadence
    had set in. This has influenced everybody and everything. I am
    always glad that I saw the collection of drawings by Millet in
    the H&ocirc;tel Drouot when it was there.</p>

    <p>At this moment you are in Nuenen.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">I wish, brother, there were no reasons for me to be absent.
    I wish we were walking there together in the old village
    churchyard, or looking in at a weaver's. Now that cannot be -
    why not? - oh, because I feel I should be a trouble-f&ecirc;te
    [killjoy] in my present mood.</p>

    <p>I repeat - I do not quite understand it, and think it is
    going a little too far - when you as well as Father feel
    ashamed just to walk with me. For my part I stay away, though
    my heart longs for us to be together.</label></p>

    <p>Because I cannot spare that one little moment of seeing you
    or Father without mental reservations, only for the sake of
    indissoluble ties, I wish we would never again speak about the
    question of manners or clothes when we meet again. You see that
    in everything I withdraw as far as possible instead of pushing
    myself forward. But don't let decorum breed a general
    estrangement. That one bright moment - of seeing each other
    once a year - must not be darkened. Adieu.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I do not hesitate about the work.</p>

    <p>You have read Fromont Jeune et Riszler ain&eacute;, haven't
    you? Of course I do not find you in Fromont Jeune, but in
    Riszler ain&eacute; - in his being absorbed in his work, his
    resoluteness <i>there</i>, for the rest a simple fellow and
    rather careless and short-sighted, wanting little for himself,
    so that he himself did not change when he became rich - I find
    some likeness to myself.</p>

    <p>All my ideas about my work are so well ordered, so definite,
    that I think you would do well to accept what I say: let me go
    my own way, just as I am. My drawings will become good, even if
    we continue as we did till now; but as their turning out well
    depends a little on the money for my obligations and expenses -
    and not just on my efforts - be as liberal as you can about the
    money, and if you see a chance of finding any help from others,
    don't neglect it. But in fact, I have said everything I have to
    say in these few lines.</p>

    <p>You must not let my conduct when I left Goupil's deceive you
    as to my real character. If business would have meant to me
    then what art does now, I would have acted more resolutely. But
    then I was in doubt whether it was my career or not, and I was
    more passive. When they said to me, &ldquo;Hadn't you better
    go,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;You think I had better go, so I
    shall go&rdquo; - no more. At the time more things were left
    unspoken than said aloud.</p>

    <p>If they had acted differently then, if they had said,
    &ldquo;We do not understand your behaviour on this or that
    occasion, explain it,&rdquo; things would have turned out
    differently.</p>

    <p>I already told you, brother, that discretion is not always
    understood. &ldquo;Tant pis,&rdquo; perhaps. Now I think it is
    better that I have the career I have, but when I left Goupil's
    there were motives other than my attire, at least on my
    part.</p>

    <p>There was a kind of plan then to give me a position in
    London in the new gallery, in the picture department, for
    which, in the first place, I didn't think myself qualified, and
    in the second place, I didn't like it. I should not have minded
    staying with Goupil if my work had been other than entertaining
    visitors.</p>

    <p>In short, if they had asked me then, &ldquo;Do you like this
    business?&rdquo; My answer would have been, &ldquo;Yes,
    sure.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do you care to stay?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, if you think
    me worth my wages, and do not think me a nuisance or injurious
    to your interests.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And then I should perhaps have asked for a position in the
    printing office, or that one in London, but a little modified,
    and I think I should have got it.</p>

    <p>But they did not ask me anything, but just said, &ldquo;Vous
    &ecirc;tes un employ&eacute; honn&ecirc;te et actif, mais vous
    donnez un exemple mauvais pour les autres.&rdquo; [You are an
    honest and active employee, but you set a bad example to the
    others.] And I did not say anything in reply because I did not
    want to have any influence on my staying or not.</p>

    <p>But I could have said a lot of things in reply if I had
    cared too, and such things as I believe would have made it
    possible for me to stay.</p>

    <p>I tell you this because I do not understand why you do not
    know that the reason then was quite another than my manner of
    dressing.</p>

    <p>Now - to you - I say what I do not doubt it is right to say,
    as my profession is my profession and I do not waver, but must
    stick to it. So I tell you this: not only do I wish to keep
    things as they are between us, but I am so grateful for our
    relation that I pay no attention to the question of being
    richer or poorer, having an easier or a more difficult life -
    silently accepting the fact that I am content with every
    condition, and that I resign myself to everything and put up
    with everything, if it must be.</p>

    <p>The only thing I do not want you to doubt is my good will,
    my zeal - and further, I want you to credit me with some common
    sense, and not suspect me of doing absurd things, and I want
    you to let me go on living quietly in my own way.</p>

    <p>Of course I must experiment to find things, and suffer
    failures, but in the end the work will come out all right.</p>

    <p>To have patience till it turns out well, not to give up
    before the end, not to doubt - that is what I wish you and I
    together would do and continue to do. I do not know to what
    extent we shall have financial success if we stick to that, but
    I feel sure of one thing, that - <i>provided there is
    cooperation and harmony</i> - we shall be able to continue as
    long as we live, sometimes not selling anything, and having
    hard times, then again selling and living more comfortably.
    That's the long and the short of it. Success depends on our
    will to stay together: as long as that remains, it is
    possible.</p>

    <p>Now I mention Riszler ain&eacute; again (I think you know
    the book, otherwise you must read it, and you will see what I
    mean) and I call your attention to the fact that the man's
    appearance was more or less like mine, that he spent his life
    working at his designs and machines in the garret of the
    factory, not caring about or minding anything else, his
    greatest luxury being to take a glass of beer with an old
    friend.</p>

    <p>Mind, the plot of the novel does not matter at all here,
    other things in the book of no consequence, but I called the
    character to your attention, Riszler ain&eacute;'s way of
    living, <i>without arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e of anything
    else in the story</i>. In fact, only to explain to you that I
    think little of my clothes because my way of working - my way
    of doing business, if you like - is a personal thing, is
    <i>not</i> having to go to see other people. The few friends I
    shall make later on will take me as I am, I hope.</p>

    <p>I think you will understand this, and that it does not make
    me angry when things are said to me about my clothes. No, it
    makes me inwardly more and more calm and concentrated, and it
    would take entirely different things to make me angry. Wherever
    I go, I should always be about the same - perhaps everywhere I
    should really make a bad impression at first. But I doubt if
    that impression should remain forever with those persons to
    whom I should speak about it intimately.</p>

    <p>Well, from this moment I am again quite absorbed in my work.
    Do for me what you can, think yourself about what can be of use
    to us and hasten the success. I do not doubt your goodwill and
    your friendship.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, have pleasant days and write soon. Adieu.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
