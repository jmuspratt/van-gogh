  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Though I have nothing very unusual to tell you, I wanted to
    let you know that I saw our friend Roulin again last Monday.
    There was enough reason for it too, as the whole of France was
    shaken. Certainly in <i>our</i> eyes the election and its
    results and its representatives are only symbols. But what it
    proves once more is that worldly ambition and fame pass away,
    but the human heart beats the same to this day, in as perfect
    sympathy with the past of our buried forefathers as with the
    generation to come.</p>

    <p>I had a very friendly letter from Gauguin this morning, to
    which I replied without delay. When Roulin came I had just
    finished <art id=0454>the duplicate</art> <art id=458>of my sunflowers</art>, and I showed him the
    <art id=0505>two examples</art> of <art id=0506>&ldquo;La Berceuse&rdquo;</art>
    between <art id=0453>the four</art> bunches<art id=0459> of flowers</art>. Roulin sends
    his kind regards.</p>

    <p>He was present at the demonstration in Marseilles on Sunday
    at the time that the election result was telegraphed from
    Paris. Like Paris, the whole population of Marseilles was moved
    to the very depths of their soul.</p>

    <p>Well, who is there now who will dare to order any gun at all
    to fire, machine gun or Lebel rifle, when so many hearts have
    already offered themselves to serve as cannon fodder? All the
    more because certainly the victorious politicians of this great
    day, Rochefort and Boulanger, are with one accord more
    ambitious for a graveyard than for any throne. Anyhow, that was
    our interpretation of what has happened, not just Roulin's and
    mine, but many others'. Nevertheless we were greatly moved.
    Roulin told me that he almost cried when he saw that silent
    crowd at Marseilles, and he only recovered himself when he
    turned and saw behind him some very, very old friends, who
    stopped and happened to recognize him. Then they had supper
    together till late into the night.</p>

    <p>Although he was very tired, he could not resist the desire
    to come to Arles to see his family again, and he came to shake
    hands, almost dropping with sleep and very pale. I could just
    show him the two copies of the portrait of his wife, which
    pleased him very much.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">From what I am told, I am very obviously looking better;
    inwardly my heart is rather too full of so many feelings and
    divergent hopes, for I am amazed to be getting better.</label></p>

    <p>Everyone here is kind to me, the neighbours, etc., kind and
    attentive as if I were at home.</p>

    <p>I know already that several people here would ask me for
    portraits if they dared. Roulin, quite a poor fellow and lowly
    employee though he is, is much respected, and it is known that
    I have done his whole family.</p>

    <p>My dear brother, in the meantime we will certainly go on suffering, make mistakes,
    fall into misfortune, I can't deny it, but we will always have worked in this present '89
    with the French who we admire so much, since on their part they have made us feel that
    this is our homeland too. Still, that's the way they are.</p>

    <p>Don't speak to your fianc&eacute;e about this business between us. Just let me go
     on working in the way I asked you until the end of March. And in this way I will have done some
     impressionist canvases, right?

    <p>Today I am working on <art id=0508>a third &ldquo;Berceuse.&rdquo;</art>
    I know very well that it is neither drawn nor
    painted as correctly as a Bouguereau and I rather regret this,
    because I have an earnest desire to be correct. But though it
    is doomed, alas, to be neither a Cabanel nor a Bouguereau, yet
    I hope that it will be French.</p>

    <p>It has been a magnificent day with no wind, and I have such
    a longing to work that I am astonished, as I did not expect it
    any more.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I will finish this letter like Gauguin's, by telling you
    that there certainly are signs of previous overexcitement in my
    words, but that is not surprising, since everyone in this good
    Tarascon country is a trifle cracked.</label></p>

    <p>With a good handshake, also for De Haan and Isa&auml;cson. I
    shall expect your letter as soon as possible after February
    1.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
