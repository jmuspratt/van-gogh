    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Though I have been expecting a letter from you every day, I
    am writing you once more.</p>

    <p>I heard some news of you from Mr. Tersteeg when he came back
    from Paris. He told me that you were all right, and he seemed
    quite satisfied with his trip. When I went to see him, I took a
    few drawings with me; he said they were better than the others,
    and told me to make some more small ones. I am busy with them
    now.</p>

    <p>I also made a new pen drawing of an old woman knitting. And
    I think this one is better than last summer's, at least it has
    more tone. When I have finished a few pen drawings which are
    well done, I think I know a purchaser for them.</p>

    <p>A few days ago I also wrote C. M. to tell him that I have
    taken a studio here, and that I hoped he would let me know
    whenever he came to The Hague and that he would come to see me.
    <label content="business.selling">Last summer Uncle Cent also told me that whenever I had
    finished a drawing somewhat smaller than those I was doing and
    more watercolours, I must send them to him and he would buy
    them. Perhaps the time is really not far off when I shall earn
    some money with my work; I need to very much, for no other
    reason than to go on working seriously.</label></p>

    <p>You must tell me if you can find out what kind of drawings
    the magazines would take. I think they could use pen drawings
    of types from the people, and I should like so much to make
    something that is fit for reproduction; I do not think that all
    the drawings are made directly on the blocks - there must be
    some means of getting a facsimile on the block. But I do not
    know exactly what process is used. Sometimes I long so much to
    see you and have a talk with you. Will it be long before you
    can come to Holland? I think that Father rather expected you on
    his birthday.</p>

    <p>I was very glad that Mr. Tersteeg thought the drawings
    somewhat better. Well, I am getting more used to my model, and
    for that very reason I must continue with her. In the last two
    studies I grasped the character much better - everyone who saw
    them told me so.</p>

    <p>At present I sometimes go out drawing with Breitner, a young
    painter who is acquainted with Rochussen the same way I am with
    Mauve. He draws very well, and in quite a different style from
    mine, and we often make sketches together in the soup kitchen
    or in the waiting room, etc. now and then he comes to my studio
    to see wood engravings, and I go to see him too. He has the
    studio that Apol used to have at Siebenhaar's.</p>

    <p>Last week I went to a small art show at Pulchri, where I saw
    sketches by Bosboom and Henkes. Very fine; Henkes had much
    larger figures than one usually sees from him. He ought to do
    more of them, I think. Weissenbruch has also been to see
    me.</p>

    <p>Every day I look for a letter from you, for I hope that you
    will send me some money soon. We must keep on and persevere,
    brother, you as well as I, and someday we shall reap the fruit
    of it.</p>

    <p>I am so glad I have worked on the figure up to now. If I had
    done only landscapes, yes, then I should probably do something
    that would sell at a small price now, but then later I would be
    stranded. The figure takes more time and is more complicated,
    but I think that in the long run it is more worthwhile.</p>

    <p>De Bock came to see me this afternoon, just as I was working
    with my model. When he saw her, he said he would also like to
    draw from the figure; but for all that, he doesn't do it. But
    he made a very beautiful drawing recently.</p>

    <p>In your last letter you told me something about the question
    of your not being able to draw an advance before the inventory
    was made. But if you cannot get the money, then be so kind as
    to write at once to Mr. Tersteeg about it, for I have only
    about 3 guilders left, and it is nearly the middle of February
    already.</p>

    <p>At all events, I expect a letter from you one of these
    days.</p>

    <p>I think that in my last drawings the proportions are much
    better than before, which has been the worst fault in my
    drawings up to now; thank God it is changing, and then I shall
    not fear anything.</p>

    <p>Adieu, Theo, write soon, a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
