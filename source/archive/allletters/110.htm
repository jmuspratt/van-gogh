  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>The time approaches when you will go on your business trip
    for Messrs. Goupil and Co., and I am already savouring the
    prospect of seeing you again. I want to ask you one thing:
    could not you arrange it so that we could be quietly and calmly
    together for at least one whole day?</p>

    <p>This week Mendes is out of town, spending a few days with
    the Rev. Schr&ouml;der at Zwolle, a former pupil of his. So
    having some leisure I could carry out an old plan to go and see
    the etchings by Rembrandt in the Trippenhuis, I went there this
    morning and I am glad I did so. While there, I thought,
    could not Theo and I see them together some day? Think it over,
    whether you could spare a day or two for such things.<label content="attitude.father"> How would
    a man like Father, who so often goes long distances even in the
    night with a lantern, to visit a sick or dying man, to speak
    with him about One whose word is light even in the night of
    suffering and agony, how would he feel about the etchings of
    Rembrandt, for instance &ldquo;The Flight to Egypt in the
    Night&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Burial of Jesus&rdquo;?</label> The
    collection in the Trippenhuis is splendid, I saw many I had
    never seen before, they also told me there about drawings by
    Rembrandt at the Fodor Museum. If you think it possible, speak
    about it with Mr. Tersteeg and drop me a line when you are
    coming, then I can finish my work and shall be free and quite
    at your disposal when you come.</p>

    <p>I never see things of that kind, etchings or paintings too,
    but I think of you and all at home.</p>

    <p>But I am up to my ears in my work, for it is becoming clear
    to me what I really must know, what <i>they</i> know and what
    inspires <i>those</i> whom I should like to follow.
    &ldquo;Examine the Scriptures&rdquo; is not written in vain,
    but that word is a good guide and I should like to become the
    sort of scribe, who from his treasure brings forth old and new
    things.</p>

    <p>I spent Monday evening with Vos and Kee; they love each
    other truly, and one can easily perceive that where love
    dwells, God commands his blessing. It is a nice home, though it
    is a great pity that he could not remain a preacher. When one
    sees them side by side in the evening, in the kindly lamplight
    of their little living room, quite close to the bedroom of
    their boy, who wakes up every now and then and asks his mother
    for something, it is an idyll. On the other hand, they have
    known days of anxiety and sleepless nights and fears and
    troubles, too.</p>

    <p>Walked back over the big piles of sand near the East Railway
    - you know where I mean - and along the Buitenkant; the moon
    was shining, and everything was full of Matthijs Maris and
    Andersen. From there you get such a superb view of the town and
    the towers, and here and there lights on one side, and on the
    other, the Ij and Bicker's Island. And that deep silence,
    &ldquo;e'en the withered leaf rustles not, the stars alone do
    speak.&rdquo; [Quoted in English: &ldquo;When the sounds cease,
    God's voice is heard under the stars.&rdquo;]</p>

    <p>Last Sunday I went to the Oudezijds Chapel and heard the
    Reverend Jeremie Meyer's sermon on Ecclesiastes 11:7-12: 7:</p>

    <p>Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
    eyes to behold the sun: but if a man live many years, and
    rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness;
    for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.</p>

    <p>Rejoice, O young man&hellip;and let thy heart cheer thee in
    the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and
    in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these
    things God will bring thee into judgement. Therefore remove
    sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for
    childhood and youth are vanity.</p>

    <p>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
    evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt
    say, I have no pleasure in them; while the sun, or the light,
    or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds
    return after the rain: In the day when the keepers of the house
    shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the
    grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of
    the windows be darkened, and the doors shall be shut in the
    streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall
    rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of
    musick shall be brought low; also when they shall be afraid of
    that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the
    almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a
    burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long
    home, and the mourners go about the streets: or ever the silver
    cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be
    broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.
    Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
    spirit shall return unto God who gave it.</p>

    <p>For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also
    reap&hellip;he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit
    reap life everlasting [see Galatians 6:7-8].</p>

    <p>In the same chapel I once heard the Reverend Mr. Laurillard
    in the early sermon on Jer. 8:7, &ldquo;Yea, the stork in the
    heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the
    crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming.&rdquo;
    In connection with this he told that once he saw a swarm of
    birds of passage when he was walking along a road where the
    leaves were already falling from the trees; and he said that
    one day every man shall be as a bird of passage, migrating to a
    warmer land. He treated this subject in the manner of Michelet
    or R&uuml;ckert or the many painters who have painted it, among
    others, Protais, &ldquo;Souvenirs de la patrie.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Father wrote me that you had been to Antwerp, I am longing
    to hear what you saw there. Long ago I too saw the old pictures
    in the Museum, and I think I even remember a beautiful portrait
    by Rembrandt; if one could remember things clearly, that would
    be fine, but it is like the view on a long road, in the
    distance things appear smaller and in a haze.</p>

    <p>One evening there was a fire here on the river - a boat
    loaded with arrack, or something like it, was burning: I was
    with Uncle on the Wassenaar, there was, relatively speaking, no
    danger as they had removed the burning steamer from between
    the other ships and had fastened it to the moorings. When the
    flames rose high one saw the Buitenkant and the black row of
    people that stood looking there, and the little boats that were
    hovering around the blaze of the fire looked also black in the
    water in which the flames were reflected; I do not know if you
    remember the photographs after the works of Jazet that were in
    the Galerie Photographique at the time, but have been destroyed
    since, &ldquo;Christmas Eve,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fire,&rdquo; and
    others, this was something like them.</p>

    <p>Twilight is falling, &ldquo;blessed twilight,&rdquo; Dickens
    called it and indeed he was right. Blessed twilight, especially
    when two or three are together in harmony of mind and like
    scribes bring forth out of their treasure things old and
    new.</p>

    <p>Blessed twilight, when two or three are gathered together in
    His name and He is in the midst of them, and blessed is the man
    who knows these things and follows them too.</p>

    <p>Rembrandt knew that, for from the rich treasure of his heart
    he brought forth among other things that drawing in sepia,
    charcoal, ink, etc. which is at the British Museum,
    representing the house in Bethany. In that room twilight has
    fallen, the figure of our Lord, noble and impressive, stands
    out serious and dark against the window through which the
    evening twilight is shedding itself. At the feet of Jesus sits
    Mary who has chosen that good part which shall not be taken
    away from her, and Martha is in the room busy with something
    or other, if I remember well she stirs the fire or something
    like it. That drawing I hope never to forget nor what it seems
    to tell me: &ldquo;I am the light of the world, he that
    followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the
    light of life.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Like the figure of John Halifax, who said that he was a
    Christian, his figure outlined against a white-curtained window
    in a room at Rose Cottage, I think, on an evening like so many
    that are described with so much feeling in the book&hellip;.the
    light of the Gospel preached unto the poor in the Kingdom of my
    Father shining like a candle on a candlestick, upon all that
    are in the house [see Matt. 5:15]. I am come that they may have
    life, and that they might have it in abundance [see John
    10:10]. I am the Resurrection, and the life, and he that
    believeth in me shall never die. Whomsoever loveth me my Father
    shall honour him, and we will come and make our abode with him
    [John 14:23]; we shall come unto him and have Supper with
    him.</p>

    <p>Such things twilight tells to those who have ears to hear
    and a heart to understand and to believe in God - blessed
    twilight! And in that picture by Ruyperez, the &ldquo;Imitation
    of Jesus Christ&rdquo;, it is also twilight, and also in
    another etching by Rembrandt: &ldquo;David in Prayer to
    God.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But it is not always blessed twilight, as you can see from
    my handwriting, I am sitting upstairs by the lamp, for there
    are visitors downstairs and I cannot sit there with my books.
    Uncle Jan sends you his compliments.</p>

    <p>Last week Hendrik and Marie were here for a day; they have
    gone now. Monday a telegram arrived, saying that the Madura had
    arrived in Southampton. The day they left, Uncle took a train
    to Nieuwendiep at six o'clock in the morning to see them off,
    together with Mr. Vos, who had come here from Utrecht the night
    before.</p>

    <p>Oh, boy, how glorious it must be to have a life behind one
    like Pa's; may God grant us to be, and to become increasingly,
    sons after the spirit and his heart. He can raise man above his
    nature, His strength may be fulfilled in our weakness [see 11
    Cor.12:7 and 9].</p>

    <p>Have a good time, write soon and come soon, for it is well
    to see each other again and to talk things over, perhaps this
    summer we can go and see the exhibition that will be opened a
    few days from now. Compliments to the Rooses, &agrave; Dieu, a
    handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
