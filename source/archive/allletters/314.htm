  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am writing a letter to Father at the same time as this
    one, in which a few things are set forth which now I need not
    write twice. Be so kind as to read Father's letter. In this
    letter for you,<label content="feelings.ambition"> I say again that more and more it seems to me
    that not looking too far or aspiring too high is the most
    practical and direct way to make progress with my work. It is
    stimulating to think of London, know this well, but the
    question is only, is it to be done now? </label>Is now the right
    moment? In fact, isn't it better to say to myself straight out:
    &ldquo;Don't think yourself ripe enough yet, because what you
    want and mean to do does not yet seem comprehensible enough to
    those who see it - as they are, so to speak, more or less
    frightened by it; keep on going - work faithfully and firmly
    after nature. Seek it once more in nature only, on the heath or
    in the dunes, and for the present don't mind that those who
    have seen it don't think much of it yet. Don't go on showing
    it, don't think of immediate approval in London - it must get
    even better.&rdquo; I say all these things to myself, and after
    thinking over what I write about the woman, you too will
    perhaps find there are reasons for hesitating about going to
    London directly. I cannot decide yet.</p>

    <p>But a simple thought, which seems good to me just because of
    its simplicity, is that I should take no step other than going
    and living more cheaply someplace in the country where the
    scenery is striking. I am anxious to know whether Father and
    you can comprehend my feelings about staying with the woman. I
    should wish it were possible that, instead of sending her out
    into the street again, we might return her promise to better
    herself with a cordial pardoning and forgetting.</p>

    <p>It is better that she be saved than that she be ruined.</p>

    <p>This morning she said to me, &ldquo;As to what I did before,
    I do not even think of it, and have not mentioned it to Mother
    either. I only know that if I have to go, I shall not earn
    enough, especially as I shall have to pay board for the
    children; and if in that case I walk the street, it will be
    because I must, not because I want to.&rdquo; I think I wrote
    you once what passed between us when she was in the hospital
    and I had not yet decided whether I should take her into my
    house or not. She never asked anything then either, which
    contrasts very much with her more ordinary behaviour.</p>

    <p>I cannot say exactly what her expression was, but it was
    something like a sheep that would say, &ldquo;If I must be
    slaughtered, I won't try to defend myself.&rdquo; At any rate,
    something so pathetic that I can only pardon fully - aye, feel
    guilty myself - rather than accuse her. However, I kept this to
    myself, and made her promise several things: that she would be
    more orderly, more zealous, pose better, not go to her mother,
    etc.</p>

    <p>And now I have completely forgiven and forgotten, without
    reservation, and I take her part just as I did before.</p>

    <p>It is a heartfelt pity which is so strong that everything
    gives way before it, and I cannot act otherwise than last year
    in that hospital, and I say now as I did then, As long as I
    have a crust of bread and a roof over my head, it is yours. It
    was no passion then, it is no passion now; it is understanding
    each other's vital wants. Knowing now, however, how her people
    upset her last year, and fearing she might fall back again, I
    should like to live with her someplace in a little village
    where she could see nothing of the town and could live a more
    natural life. However, I have known from the beginning that her
    constitution required <i>years</i> to recover, and so there is
    still hope.</p>

    <p>Well, the little boy really dotes on me. Now that that he is
    beginning to crawl and stand, he is always at my side wherever
    I go in the house.</p>

    <p>Look here, Theo, by acting according to what we feel, firmly
    and resolutely, I think we may fall into mistakes, may meet
    with deceptions several times; but I think we shall be saved
    from a great evil and from despair if we ask what our duty is -
    and do what ought to be done as well as we can.</p>

    <p>Now about the work, I do not doubt it has its faults, but
    neither do I doubt that I am not entirely wrong, and that I
    shall succeed, though it be after a long period of seeking.</p>

    <p>And I believe that it is dangerous to expect success
    anywhere else but in the work.</p>

    <p>I wish I had, for instance, Mauve or Herkomer for a friend.
    However, I believe that isn't the most important thing, neither
    would they consider it the most important. By working on
    faithfully, it may last a longer or a shorter time, be more or
    less successful; sooner or later one will meet among the
    painters the lifetime friend, as for instance M. or H. might
    be.</p>

    <p>And perhaps it will come sooner if one goes on working
    quietly than if one goes begging for it, or visiting people,
    which for me has the smaller chance of success because of some
    eccentricities in me which you notice even more than I, though
    I occasionally notice them myself too, but I do not think them
    so bad that I should not be astonished at the continuous
    obstacles when trying to get some people to have some
    confidence in me. Suppose my faults are as bad and as obvious,
    for instance, as the woman's: then I should wish that some
    people did for me what I am now doing for the woman - and have
    already done several times - forgive, not just partially, but
    completely, as though nothing had happened or would happen
    again. If you have perhaps said something to C. M. about my
    leaving the woman, please take it back immediately; I cannot do
    a thing which will prove to be cruel or unmerciful. I do not
    know whether I shall be happy with the woman in the future,
    maybe not, it certainly won't be perfect; happiness is not
    anything we ourselves are responsible for - but we are
    responsible for how far we heed conscience.</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, let me hear from you while you are still at
    Nuenen.</p>

    <p>I cannot speak differently.</p>

    <p>Just read Father's letter.</p>

    <p>If I deserted the woman, she would perhaps go mad, but
    because I have already often found the way to calm her in her
    fits of unbearable temper, by quieting a fear which oppressed
    her, because in the course of this year she has learned to
    understand that she has found in me a true friend, on whom she
    can lean in her weakness, who understands her troubles, it has
    given her a feeling of rest when I am with her; and I hope she
    will improve in time, especially if she is no longer attracted
    by what draws her back to the past, of which she had better not
    be reminded.</p>

    <p>Moving to the country would be a good thing, but at the same
    time it must be an economy measure. She has been told, for
    instance, that I should leave her because of the children. That
    isn't true, it would never be my reason, but it is one of the
    things which upset her and make her wish she did not have
    children.</p>

    <p>Theo, as a matter of fact she does improve, but one has to
    show her the same thing over and over again, and she can make
    one feel discouraged; but when - which rarely happens - she
    tries to say what she means and thinks, it is wonderful how
    pure she is, notwithstanding her depravity. As if, far deep in
    the ruin of her soul and heart and mind, something had been
    saved.</p>

    <p>And in those rare moments her expression is like that of a
    &ldquo;Mater Dolorosa&rdquo; by Delacroix or like certain heads
    by Ary Scheffer.</p>

    <p>That's what I believe in, and now that I have seen it again,
    I respect that depth of feeling and won't mention her
    faults.</p>

    <p>I hope, boy, you will see a few beautiful sunsets over the
    silent quiet country, far away from the city, before you go
    back.</p>

    <p>As to the change of residence, I know that I could find it
    in more than one place. But of course we do what must be done,
    in all calmness, and we shall write each other about it
    yet.</p>

    <p>Adieu, have a good time and know that whatever the future
    may bring, I have hope for better times.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent.</p>
