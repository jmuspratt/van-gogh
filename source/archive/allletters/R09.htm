  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Herewith I am returning the 2.50 guilders you were so kind
    as to lend me. <label content="business.sales">I got a letter about my drawings, but received
    even less than I expected, although I did not expect more than
    30 guilders for the seven sheets. I received 20 guilders with a
    scolding in the bargain: did I happen to think that such
    drawings had the slightest commercial value?</label></p>

    <p>I think you will admit that times are not easy, and such
    experiences (and there are so many worse things - compared with
    other kinds of treatment, this may be called generous) - and
    such experiences, I say, are not exactly very encouraging.</p>

    <p>Art is jealous, and demands our whole strength; and then,
    when one devotes all one's powers to it, to be looked upon as a
    kind of unpractical fellow and all kinds of other things - yes,
    that leaves a bitter taste in one's mouth.</p>

    <p>Oh well, we must try to carry on.</p>

    <p>I answered him that I did not pretend to be acquainted with
    the commercial value of things - that since he as a merchant
    told me there was no commercial value in them, I did not want
    to contradict him or to deny it - that I personally attached
    more importance to the artistic value, and preferred to
    interest myself in nature instead of calculating prices and
    fixing commercial values - that if, after all, I spoke to him
    about the price, and could not give my things gratis for
    nothing, this was because, like all other human beings, I have
    my human needs, wanting food and a roof over my head, and so
    on, and that I considered it my duty to adjust these relatively
    insignificant matters. But I told him that I did not want to
    impose my work upon him against his wishes, and that I was
    willing to send him new drawings, but that I was equally
    willing to reconcile myself to losing his custom. But I am
    practically sure that what will happen is that this behaviour
    of mine will be considered ungrateful, rude and impertinent.
    And that as soon as the subject is raised, I shall be
    reproached in this way &ldquo;Your uncle in Amsterdam, who
    meant so well by you, and was so kind to you, and gave you such
    help ... in consequence of your pretentiousness and
    obstinacy... you treated him so ungratefully that it is your
    own fault, etc., etc.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>My friend Rappard, in point of fact I don't know whether I
    ought to laugh or cry over such an incident. I think it so
    characteristic. Of course - those rich merchants are the
    decent, honest, righteous, loyal, sensitive fellows, and we,
    poor devils, who sit and draw, in the country, or in the
    street, or in the studio, at times very early in the morning,
    at other times in the dead of night, at times in the blazing
    sun, at other times in the snow, <i>we</i> are the fellows
    without finer feelings, without practical minds, and above all,
    without &ldquo;distinguished manners.&rdquo; All right, so be
    it!</p>

    <p>This uncle of mine in Amsterdam also told me with great
    aplomb that De Groux was really &ldquo;a bad man.&rdquo; You
    will understand how much this altered my opinion of father De
    Groux. The only thing I said - and to which he has not made an
    answer up till now, this noble merchant - was this:
    &ldquo;Cependant il me semble qu'il s'agit bien moins de
    <i>gagner</i> que de <i>m&eacute;riter</i>.&rdquo; [And
    yet it seems to me that it is much less a question of
    <i>earning</i> than of <i>deserving</i>.]</p>

    <p>Oh well - I only mention it to open the safety valve of the
    engine a bit, so to speak. Otherwise I might go on bearing a
    grudge because of the whole affair, whereas there is nothing I
    wish more than to stop thinking about it and to forget it
    altogether - but these fellows always begin by being so nice;
    at first they are so charming that, when it comes to the point,
    one is all the more flabbergasted.</p>

    <p>Adieu; once more: many thanks, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
