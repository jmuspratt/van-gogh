    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is already relatively late, almost twelve o'clock, but I
    want to write to you before the day is over. In the first
    place, it is so long since I wrote you - but, my dear fellow,
    what shall I write? I am up to my ears in work here, so that
    the days pass without my having time to think of or keep up an
    interest in many things that used to attract me.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">What prompts me to write is that I heard from home that you
    have had an offer to go to Paris for six weeks.</label> If you go
    there, you will pass the Borinage. I wanted you to consider
    spending a day, or more if possible, here. I should so much
    like to have you know this country, too, because it has so many
    peculiarities for one who knows how to look at things
    attentively. To one who had never seen a village by the sea,
    would it not be interesting to see Scheveningen or Katwijk, or
    any other such village? Well, there is no sea here, but the
    character of everything is interesting and worthy of notice. So
    if you feel inclined and have an opportunity, stay here, but do
    write beforehand when you are coming and where, at which
    station I shall find you, and on what train.</p>

    <p>I shall give this letter to Mother when she comes, for in
    all probability I shall meet her when she comes back from
    Paris. [Their mother had been called to Paris; on his way to
    the South, Uncle Vincent had fallen dangerously ill there] I am
    looking forward to seeing her. Happily for Uncle, the danger
    seems past for the present.</p>

    <p>The news of Frans Soek's death touched me deeply; if you
    know any particulars, I should like to hear them. Poor fellow,
    his life was not easy, for he had many struggles.</p>

    <p>A few days ago we had a very heavy thunderstorm at about
    eleven o'clock in the evening. Quite near our house there is a
    spot from which one can see, far below, a large part of the
    Borinage, with the chimneys, the mounds of coal, the little
    miners' cottages, the scurrying little black figures by day,
    like ants in a nest; and farther on, dark pine woods with
    little white cottages silhouetted against them, a few church
    spires a way off, an old mill, etc. Generally there is a kind
    of haze hanging over it all, or a fantastic chiaroscuro effect
    formed by the shadows of the clouds, reminding one of pictures
    by Rembrandt or Michel or Ruysdael.</p>

    <p>But during that thunderstorm in the pitch-dark night the
    flashes of lightning made a curious effect: now and then
    everything became visible for a moment. Near by the large,
    gloomy buildings of the Marcasse mine stood alone, isolated in
    the open field, that night conjuring up the huge bulk of Noah's
    Ark as it must have looked in the terrible pouring rain and the
    darkness of the Flood, illuminated by a flash of lightning.
    Tonight in a Bible class I described a shipwreck, still under
    the influence of that thunderstorm.</p>

    <p>I often read in Uncle Tom's Cabin these days. There is still
    so much slavery in the world, and in this remarkably wonderful
    book that important question is treated with so much wisdom, so
    much love, and such zeal and interest in the true welfare of
    the poor oppressed that one comes back to it again and again,
    always finding something new.</p>

    <p>I still can find no better definition of the word art than
    this, &ldquo;L'art c'est l'homme ajout&eacute; &agrave; la
    nature&rdquo; [art is man added to nature] - nature, reality,
    truth, but with a significance, a conception, a character,
    which the artist brings out in it, and to which he gives
    expression, &ldquo;qu'il d&eacute;gage,&rdquo; which he
    disentangles, sets free and interprets. A picture by Mauve or
    Mans or Isra&euml;ls says more, and says it more clearly, than
    nature herself. It is the same with books, and in Uncle Tom's
    Cabin especially, the artist has put things in a new light; in
    this book, though it is becoming an old book already - that is,
    written years ago - all things have be-come new. The sentiment
    in it is so fine, so elaborate, so masterly. It is written with
    so much love, so much seriousness, so faithfully. It is humble
    and simple, but at the same time so truly sublime, so noble and
    refined.</p>

    <p>Recently I read a book about the English coal district, but
    it did not give many particulars. Enclosed is a wood engraving
    for your collection.</p>

    <p>The other day I made the acquaintance of somebody who has
    been a foreman over the miners for many years. Of humble
    origin, he is a self-made man. Now he has a lung disease,
    serious enough, and can no longer stand the terribly fatiguing
    work down in the mine. It is very interesting to hear him speak
    about all those things relating to the mines. He has always
    remained a friend of the miner (unlike so many others who have
    also got on, but more for the sake of money than real
    distinction, and prompted by less noble and very often mean
    motives). He has the heart of a labourer - faithful and honest
    and brave - but he is far superior to most of them in
    intellectual development. More than once during a strike he has
    been the only person with any influence on the miners. They
    would listen to nobody, they would follow nobody's advice but
    his; and he alone was obeyed in the critical moment. When I met
    him for the first time, I thought of the etching by Meissonier
    which we know so well, &ldquo;The Reader.&rdquo; One of the
    Denis boys is about to become engaged to his daughter, that is
    why he visits the house here now and then, though rarely, and
    so I made his acquaintance. Since then I visited him a few
    times. Have you ever read Legouv&eacute;, Les P&egrave;res et
    les Enfants? It is a remarkable book. I found it at his house
    and read it with interest.</p>

    <p>A few days ago I received a letter from the Reverend Mr.
    Jones of Isleworth in which he writes about building little
    wooden churches here in the Borinage. Is that practicable, is
    it desirable? He is ready to work for that end, that is, for
    the erection of the first of such little buildings. He even
    speaks of coming here in the autumn to talk it over; I
    certainly hope it happens. If you have time, write me a line,
    and if you can, stop here when you go to Paris. At all events
    let me know, if possible, on what train you will be passing the
    station nearest to Wasmes, for then I will try to be there.
    Blessings on your work, believe me always,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
