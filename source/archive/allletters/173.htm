  <body>
    <p>Schenkweg 138, Thursday</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your letter with the enclosed 100 fr., and thank
    you very much for both. What I had already feared when I wrote
    you last has really happened, <label subject="psychology.neurological">meaning that I have not been
    well, and have been in bed for almost three days with fever and
    nervousness,</label><label content="health.dental"> now and then accompanied by headache and
    toothache.</label> It is a miserable condition and is caused by
    overexertion. Mauve has again been to see me, and once more we
    agreed to keep up courage through all.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">But I am so angry with myself now because I cannot do what I
    should like to do, and at such a moment one feels as if one
    were lying bound hand and foot a the bottom of a deep, dark
    well, utterly helpless. </label>Now I have recovered enough so that I
    got up again last night and rummaged around, straightening
    things. When the model came of her own accord this morning,
    though I only half expected her, I put her into the right pose
    with Mauve's help and tried to draw a little; but I could not
    do it, and I felt miserable and weak the whole evening. But if
    I rest a few more days, it will be over, and I need not be
    afraid of its coming back soon if I am careful.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">I am very sorry to hear that you don't feel well either.</label>
    When I was in Brussels last winter, I also took a bath at the
    bathing establishment as often as I could, two or three times a
    week; and as it did me a lot of good, I will do it here too. No
    doubt if you keep it up for some time, it will help you a great
    deal, because it keeps the blood circulating well and the pores
    of the skin open; that way the skin can fulfill its function -
    otherwise it would shrivel up, especially in winter.</p>

    <p>And I tell you frankly that in my opinion one must not
    hesitate to go to a prostitute occasionally if there is one you
    can trust and feel something for, as there really are many. For
    one who has a strenuous life it is necessary, absolutely
    necessary, in order to keep sane and well. One must not
    exaggerate such things and fall into excesses, but nature has
    fixed laws which it is fatal to struggle against. Well, you
    yourself know all you have to know on that subject. It would be
    well for you, it would be well for me, if we were married - but
    what can we do?</p>

    <p>I'm sending you a little drawing, but you must not conclude
    that they are all like that; this has been washed in quickly
    and thinly, but this does not always succeed with the larger
    ones, indeed, it seldom does. It will perhaps show you that it
    is not a hopeless business and that I have learned the knack of
    making them.</p>

    <p>The last time Mauve was here, he asked me again if I needed
    money. I was then able to say I did not want it, but you see,
    in case of need, he would be willing to do something. And so
    though there will be some difficulties now and then, I hope we
    can manage to struggle through. Especially if Mr. Tersteeg
    would be so kind as to give me some credit in case you're
    unable to send me money, and when it is absolutely
    necessary.</p>

    <p>You speak of <i>fair promises</i> - with me it is more or
    less the same. Mauve says it will be all right; but for all
    that, the watercolours I make are not quite saleable. Now I
    have some hope myself, and I will work hard on them, but it is
    often hopeless enough, for when I try to work them up, they
    become too heavy. It's exasperating, for it's no small
    difficulty. And experiments with watercolours are rather
    expensive - paper, paint, brushes, model, and time, and
    whatnot.</p>

    <p>But even so, I think the most economical way is to keep
    going without losing time.</p>

    <p>For this bad time <i>must</i> be lived through.</p>

    <p>I must try to forget some things I taught myself, and learn
    to look at things in quite a different way.</p>

    <p>It takes a lot of effort before one has a steady eye for the
    proportion of things.</p>

    <p>It is not always easy for me to get on with Mauve or vice
    versa, because I think we are equally nervous; and it costs him
    a real effort to show me things, and no less for me to
    understand them and try to put them into practice.</p>

    <p>But I think we are both beginning to understand each other
    better and the feeling is becoming somewhat deeper than
    superficial sympathy. He is very busy with his large picture,
    which was at one time intended for the Salon; it is a splendid
    thing. And he is also busy with a winter landscape. And some
    fine drawings.</p>

    <p>I think he gives each picture and each drawing some small
    part of his life. A times he is tired to death, and recently he
    said, &ldquo;I do not seem to get any stronger&rdquo;; and
    whoever had seen him at that moment would not soon forget the
    expression on his face.</p>

    <p>When my drawings become heavy, thick, muddy, black and dull,
    Mauve comforts me by saying, &ldquo;If your work were
    transparent <i>now</i>, it would only possess a certain chic,
    and it would probably become heavy later on. Now you are
    pegging away at it and it becomes heavy, but later it will go
    quickly and become light.&rdquo; I have no objections if this
    is true. And you can see it now from the little one I am
    sending: it was started and finished in a quarter of an hour,
    but only after I had made a larger one which had become too
    heavy. And just because I had worked so hard on that large one,
    when the model accidentally resumed the pose, I was able to
    sketch this little one on a bit of paper that was left from a
    sheet of Whatman. This model is a beautiful girl - she is the
    model for Artz and many others - but she wants 1.50 guilders a
    day, and that is too expensive for me just now. So I try to
    manage with my little old woman.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">I think the success or failure of a drawing also depends
    greatly on the mood and the condition of the painter. Therefore
    I try to do what I can to keep cheerful and clear-headed. But
    sometimes, like now, a heavy depression comes over me, and then
    it's hell.</label></p>

    <p>The only thing to do then is to go on with the work; for
    Mauve and Isra&euml;ls and so many others who are examples to
    the rest of us know how to profit from every mood.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">Well, I have some hope that as soon as I am quite well
    again, things will go better than they are now. If I have to
    rest awhile, I shall, but probably it will soon be over. In
    general, I do not feel so strong as a few years ago; then I
    never had to stay in bed a day, but now there is always
    something the matter with me, although nothing serious.</label></p>

    <p>Well, my youth is gone - not my love of life or my energy,
    but I mean the time when one feels so lighthearted and
    carefree. I really say, So much the better, now there are much
    better things, after all.</p>

    <p>Keep heart, boy, I think it rather mean and cheap of Messrs.
    Goupil &amp; Co. to refuse you when you wanted to draw some
    money. You certainly don't deserve such stinginess, for you
    have pulled many of their chestnuts out of the fire, and do not
    spare yourself. So you deserve to be treated with some
    consideration.</p>

    <p>A handshake in thought, I hope soon to have better news to
    tell you than I have had lately, but you must forgive me, I
    feel rotten. Adieu.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
