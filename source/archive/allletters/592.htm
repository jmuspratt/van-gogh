  <body>
    <p>My Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>The letter I have just received from you gives me great
    pleasure. You tell me that J. H. Weissenbruch has two pictures
    at the exhibition - but I imagined he was dead - am I wrong?
    Certainly he's a mighty good artist and a decent big-hearted
    fellow too.</p>

    <p>What you say about &ldquo;La Berceuse&rdquo; pleases me; it
    is very true that the common people, who are content with
    chromos and melt when they hear a barrel organ, are in some
    vague way right, perhaps more sincere than certain men about
    town who go to the Salon.</p>

    <p>If he will accept it, give Gauguin the copy of &ldquo;La
    Berceuse&rdquo; that was not mounted on a stretcher, and
    Bernard also, as a token of friendship, but if Gauguin wants
    the sunflowers, it is only fair that he should give you
    something you like equally well in exchange.</p>

    <p>Gauguin himself liked the sunflowers better later on when he
    had been looking at them for a good while.</p>

    <p>What you also have to know is that if you arrange them this
    way, namely <art id=0505>&ldquo;La Berceuse&rdquo;</art> in the middle and<art id=0455> the two
    canvases</art> of sunflowers to the right and<art id=0458> left</art>, it makes a sort
    of triptych.</p>

    <p>[Vincent inserted<art id=744_V-T_5920> a sketch of the three paintings here.</art>]</p>

    <p>And then the yellow and orange tones of the head will gain in
    brilliance by the proximity of the yellow wings.</p>

    <p>And then you will understand what I wrote you, that my idea
    had been to make a sort of decoration, for instance for the end
    of a ship's cabin. Then, as the size increases, the summary
    technique is justified. The frame for the central piece is the
    red one. And the two sunflowers which go with it are the ones
    framed in narrow strips.</p>

    <p>You see that this frame of plain laths does quite well, and
    a frame like this costs only a very little. It would perhaps be
    a good idea to frame the<art id=0475> green</art> and <art id=0495>red vineyards</art> that way,
    the<art id=0450> &ldquo;Sower&rdquo;</art> and the <art id=0574>&ldquo;Furrows&rdquo;</art> and
    the<art id=0482> bedroom interior</art> as well.</p>

    <p>[A <art id=744_V-T_5921>sketch of Ivy Covered Tree Trunks was drawn here.</art>]</p>

    <p>Here is <art id=0609>a new size 30 canvas, once again as run of the mill
    as a cheap chromo, depicting age-old love nests in the
    greenery. Large tree trunks covered with ivy,
    the ground similarly covered with ivy and periwinkle, a stone
    bench and a bush of roses, pale in the cool shadow. In the
    foreground, some plants with white calyxes. It is green, violet
    and pink.</art></p>

    <p>It's all a question - and this is unfortunately missing from
    the cheap chromos as well as from the barrel organs - of
    putting some style into it.</p>

    <p>Since I've been here, there's been enough work for me to do,
    what with the neglected garden with its tall pines and long,
    unkempt grass mixed with all sorts of weeds, and I haven't even
    been outside.</p>

    <p>However, the countryside around St. R&eacute;my is
    very beautiful, and little by little I shall probably make a
    few short trips.</p>

    <p>But while I stay here, the doctor is of course in a better
    position to see what is wrong, and will have his mind set at
    rest, I hope, about what he can let me paint.</p>

    <p>I <i>assure</i> you that I am all right here, and that for
    the time being I see no reason at all to take lodgings in or
    around Paris. I have a small room with greenish-grey paper with
    two sea-green curtains with a design of very pale roses,
    brightened by touches of blood-red.</p>

    <p>These curtains, probably the legacy of some deceased and
    ruined rich person, are very pretty in design. A very worn
    armchair, probably from the same source, is covered with a
    tapestry speckled like a Diaz or a Monticelli in brown, red,
    pink, white, cream, black, forget-me-not blue and bottle green.
    Through the iron-barred window I can see an enclosed square of
    wheat, a prospect like a Van Goyen, above which, in the
    morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory.</p>

    <p>In addition - as there are more than thirty empty rooms - I
    have another room for doing my work.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.diet">The food is all right as far as it goes. It tastes a bit
    musty, of course, as in a cockroach-infested restaurant in
    Paris, or in a boarding-house. The poor wretches here, having
    absolutely nothing to do (not a book, nothing more to distract
    them than a game of boules or a game of draughts), have no
    other daily distraction than to stuff themselves with
    chickpeas, haricot beans, lentils and other groceries and
    colonial produce, in set amounts and at stated hours.</p>

    <p>As the digestion of these foodstuffs offers certain
    difficulties, they fill their days in a way as offensive as it
    is costly.</label></p>

    <p>But joking apart, my <i>fear</i> of madness is wearing off
    markedly, since I can see at close quarters those who are
    affected by it in the same way as I may very easily be in the
    future.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was repelled by these individuals, and I found
    it distressing to have to reflect that so many in our trade,
    Troyon, Marchal, M&eacute;ryon, Jundt, M. Maris,
    Monticelli and a whole lot more finished up like that. It was
    quite impossible for me to picture them in that condition.</p>

    <p>Well, now I can think of all that without fear, that is to
    say, I find it is no more dreadful than if those people had
    died of something else, consumption or syphilis, for example. I
    see these artists being reinvested with their old serenity, and
    don't you think it's quite something to meet these old
    colleagues of ours again? That, joking apart, is what I am
    profoundly thankful for.</p>

    <p>For though there are some who howl or rave a great deal,
    there is <i>much</i> true friendship here. They say we must
    tolerate others so that the others may tolerate us, and other
    very sound arguments, which they put into practice, too. And we
    understand each other very well. Sometimes, for instance, I can
    talk with one of them who can only reply in incoherent sounds,
    because he is not afraid of me. If someone has an attack, the
    others look after him and interfere so that he does not harm
    himself.</p>

    <p>The same for those whose mania is to fly often into a rage.
    The old inhabitants of the menagerie come running and separate
    the combatants, if combat there is.</p>

    <p>It is true there are some whose condition is more serious,
    who are either dirty or dangerous. These are in another
    ward.</p>

    <p>I take a bath twice a week now, and stay in it for two
    hours; <label subject="health.gastrointestinal.stomach">my stomach is infinitely better than it was a year ago;</label>
    so as far as I know, I only have to go on. Besides, I shall
    spend less here, I think, considering that I have work in
    prospect again, for the scenery is lovely.</p>

    <p>What I hope is that at the end of a year I shall know what I
    can do and what I want to do better than now. Then little by
    little the idea of a fresh start will come to me. Going back to
    Paris or anywhere at all in no way attracts me. I think my
    place is here. Extreme enervation is, in my opinion, what most
    of those who have been here for years suffer from. Now my work
    will preserve me from that to a certain extent.</p>

    <p>The room where we stay on wet days is like a third-class
    waiting room in some stagnant village, the more so as there are
    some distinguished lunatics who always wear a hat, spectacles
    and a cane, and travelling cloak, almost like at a watering
    place, and they represent the passengers.</p>

    <p>I am forced to ask you again for some paints and especially
    for canvas. When I sent you the four canvases of the garden I
    am working on, you will see that, considering my life is spent
    mostly in the garden, it is not so unhappy.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I drew a very big, rather rare night moth, called
    a death's head, its colouring of amazing distinction, black,
    grey, cloudy white tinged with carmine or vaguely shading off
    into olive green; it is very big.</p>

    <p>[Here he drew <art id=744_V-T_5922>a sketch of the moth.</art>]</p>

    <p><art id=0610>To paint it I had to kill it</art>, and it
    was a pity, the beast was so beautiful. I will send you<art id=1523> the
    drawing</art> along with some other drawings of
    plants.</p>

    <p>You could take the canvases at Tanguy's or at your place off
    the stretchers, if they are dry enough, and then put on any new
    ones you think worth it.</p>

    <p>Gauguin ought to be able to tell you the address of a man
    who could reline &ldquo;The Bedroom,&rdquo;
    and who won't be too expensive. The restoration ought, I
    <i>imagine</i>, to cost 5 francs. If it is more, then don't
    have it done. I'm sure Gauguin didn't pay any more on the many
    occasions when he had his canvases, or C&eacute;zanne's
    or Pissaro's, relined.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.hallucinations">Again - speaking of my condition - I am so
    grateful for yet
    another thing. I've noticed that others, too, hear sounds and
    strange voices during their attacks, as I did, and that things
    seemed to change before their very eyes. And that lessened the
    horror with which I remembered my first attack, something that,
    when it comes upon you unexpectedly, cannot but frighten you
    terribly. Once you know it is part of the illness, you accept
    it like anything else. Had I had not seen other lunatics close
    to, I should not have been able to stop myself from thinking
    about it all the time. For the suffering and the anguish are
    not funny when you are having an attack.</label></p>

    <p>Most epileptics bite their tongue and injure themselves. Rey
    told me that he had seen a case where someone had mutilated his
    own ear, just as I did, and I think I heard a doctor from here,
    who came to see me with the director, say that he too had seen
    it before. I like to think that once you know what it is, once
    you are conscious of your condition, and of being subject to
    attacks, then you can do something to prevent your being taken
    unawares by the anguish or the terror. Now that it has all been
    abating for five months, I have high hopes of getting over it,
    or at least of no longer having such violent attacks.</p>

    <p>There is someone here who has been shouting and talking like
    me <i>all the time</i> for a fortnight. He thinks he hears
    voices and words in the echoes of the corridors, probably
    because the auditory nerve is diseased and over-sensitive, and
    in my case it was both sight and hearing at the same time,
    which is usual at the onset of epilepsy, according to what Rey
    said one day.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">Now, the shock was such that even moving made me feel sick,
    and nothing would have pleased me better than never to have
    woken up again. At present this <i>horror of life</i> is
    already less pronounced, and the melancholy less acute. But I
    still have no <i>will</i>, and hardly any desires, or none at
    all that are to do with ordinary life, for example, almost no
    wish to see friends, although I do think of them. That is why I
    am not ready to leave here now or in the near future. I should
    feel depressed about everything again.</label></p>

    <p>And anyway, it is only recently that my loathing of life has
    been drastically changed. There is still a long way to go from
    that to willing and doing.</p>

    <p>What a pity that you are condemned to stay full-time in
    Paris and that you never see any part of the country other than
    that around Paris. I'm sure it's no worse for me to be in the
    company I now find myself than for you to be with that
    ill-fated Goupil &amp; Co. all the time. In that respect, we
    are pretty much equal. For you, too, are only able to act
    partly in keeping with your ideas. However, once we have got
    used to these difficulties, it all becomes second nature.</p>

    <p>Although the pictures swallow up canvas and paint, etc.,
    nevertheless at the end of the month I'm sure it's more
    profitable to spend a little more on those, making use of what
    I've learned, than to abandon it all, when you have to pay for
    my board and lodging anyway. And that's why I'm carrying on. So
    this month I have four size 30 canvases and two or three
    drawings.</p>

    <p>But the question of money, whatever one does, is always with
    us, like the enemy facing the troops, and cannot be denied or
    ignored.</p>

    <p>As much as anyone, I know where my duties lie in that
    respect. And I may yet be able to pay back everything I've
    spent, for I consider it to have been, if not taken from you,
    at least taken from the family. So that's why I've been
    producing pictures and shall be doing some more. This is acting
    as you yourself are acting. If I were a man of means, perhaps
    my mind would be freer to produce art for art's sake. Now I
    content myself with the thought that by working diligently, I
    may perhaps make some progress, even without thinking about
    it</p>
