    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">I was glad you answered me so soon and that you like
    Brussels and have found a nice boarding-house. Don't lose heart
    if it is very difficult at times, everything will come out all
    right and nobody can in the beginning do as he wishes.</label></p>

    <p>How I pity Uncle Hein, I heartily hope he will recover, but,
    Theo, I fear he will not. Last summer he was still full of
    enthusiasm and had so many plans and told me that business was
    flourishing. It's very sad. Last Sunday I was at Uncle Cor's
    and spent a very pleasant day there as you can imagine, and saw
    so many beautiful things. As you know, Uncle has just come back
    from Paris and brought some beautiful pictures and drawings
    with him. I remained in Amsterdam till Monday morning and went
    to see the museums again. Do you know that they are going to
    build a large new museum in Amsterdam, instead of the
    Trippenhuis? I think it is right, for the Trippenhuis is small
    and many pictures are hung so that they can hardly be seen.</p>

    <p>How I should have liked to see that picture by Cluysenaer, I
    have only seen a few pictures of his and those I liked very
    much. Tell me if that other picture is by
    &ldquo;<i>Alfred&rdquo;</i> Stevens, or else what the first
    name is. I know the photograph after the Rotta and have even
    seen the picture at the Exhibition in Brussels. Be sure to let
    me know what pictures you see, I am always glad to know. The
    album of which you gave me the title is not the one I meant,
    which is <i>only</i> lithographs after Corot. But I thank you
    for the trouble you have taken. I hope to get a letter from
    sister Anna soon, she is rather laggard about writing of late.
    Do surprise her with a letter, that would be such a pleasure to
    her. I suppose you are very busy, but that is not bad. It is
    cold here and they are skating already. I walk as much as I
    can. I wonder if you will have any chance to skate. Enclosed
    you will find my photograph, but if you write home don't
    mention it, as you know it is for father's birthday. I have
    already sent you my congratulations upon that day. My best
    compliments to Uncle and Aunt, also to Mr. Schmidt and Eduard.
    Always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent.</p>

    <p>Kind regards from everybody at Haanebeek's, Aunt Fie and
    Roos.</p>
