    <p>Letter T33<br>
     Paris, 3 May 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I cannot tell you how glad I was of your letter, or rather
    your two letters; on the eve of my birthday I said to Jo, If a
    letter should arrive from Vincent! <sup>1</sup> - I should be
    hard put to it to mention anything I need to be completely
    happy. And look, there was your letter. Please understand that
    I should like you to feel better, and your fits of sadness to
    disappear. Your consignment of pictures arrived too, and there
    are very beautiful ones among them.</p>

    <p><art id=0629>The guard</art> and the other fellow with his
    swollen face are extraordinary; <art id=0671>the branch of almond blossoms</art>
    shows that for these themes you have missed the time of
    blooming of the trees and flowers. Let's hope that this will
    not be the case next time. The copies after Millet are perhaps
    the best things you have done yet, and induce me to believe
    that on the day you turn to painting compositions of figures,
    we may look forward to great surprises. The consignment of
    paints from Tasset and Tangui has been sent off. I hadn't
    received your second letter, and I said to myself that you
    might have use for half the quantity extra. <art id=0620>The picture for
    Aurier is one of the finest you have done so far; it has the
    richness of a peacock's tail</art>. I am going to
    take it to him very soon; I had the frame made according to
    your description, for that much I certainly owe him, and he is
    not rich.</p>

    <p>And now what is most important is your second letter in your
    telling me of your intention to come here. I am very happy that
    you feel strong enough to attempt a change, and I <i>approve
    absolutely</i> of your coming as soon as possible, to make a
    decision, for, after taking Dr. Peyron's advice, only you can
    bear the responsibility. Your trip to Arles was definitely
    disastrous; is it certain that travelling will do you no harm
    this time? If I were in your place I should only act in
    conformity with Dr. Peyron's views, and in any case as soon as
    you have decided to come here, it will be absolutely necessary
    for you to get somebody you trust to accompany you during
    <i>the whole journey</i>. The exertion of travelling and the
    sensations awakened by the sight of well-known spots may have
    an effect on your malady. If it should be possible I should
    <i>so</i> much like to have you with us for some time at least,
    and if you do everything to take care of yourself, it is very
    probable that all will go well.</p>

    <p>You say that people down there understand nothing of
    painting, but it is absolutely the same here, and don't think
    that you will find things different anywhere else, exceptions
    apart.</p>

    <p>We have held intercourse with <i>one</i> category of people
    who have made painting their principal occupation, but if you
    don't count these, it is Hebrew to the general public, and the
    simple things are even less understood than those whose subject
    gives them something to puzzle over, etc.</p>

    <p>I hope you will soon be able to tell me that your health is
    improving more and more, and that you will be able to carry out
    your plans. Please don't have too many illusions about life in
    the North; after all, every country has its advantages and
    disadvantages. I shall write you another letter before long,
    and I shall look for lithographs of the masters. I shall send
    them at the same time as the drawings from Brabant. Have
    courage, and a cordial handshake!</p>

    <p>Once again thanks for your letters and pictures. If you
    should want anything, please say so. Business is good, and I
    have everything I want. Kindest regards from Jo and the little
    one. Their portrait enclosed.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
