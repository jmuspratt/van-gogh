  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I just received your letter and the enclosure, for which
    many thanks. I want to answer you at once that I often met with
    sayings of Diderot's, and that I too think that he fits well
    into the framework of his time. It's the same with him as with
    Voltaire himself, when one reads a letter of those men's, even
    on the most commonplace things, or about <i>nothing</i>, there
    is a brightness and a sparkling spirit in them which charm.
    Let's not forget that they were the men who made the
    Revolution, and that it is the work of a genius to dominate
    one's time, and to make the minds that are thoughtless and
    passive strive in one direction and after one aim. So I have
    all respect for them. Shortly you will receive two studies of
    the autumn leaves, <art id=0045>one in yellow - poplars</art> -
    <art id=0044>the other in orange - oaks.</art></p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">I am completely absorbed in the laws of colours. If only
    they had taught us them in our youth!</p>

    <p>But it is the fate of most people that by a kind of fatality
    one has to seek for light a long time. For, that the laws of
    colour which Delacroix was the first to use, like Newton did
    for gravitation, and like Stephenson did for steam - that those
    laws of colours are a ray of light - is absolutely certain.</label></p>

    <p>I have made another <art id=0124>autumn study of the pond in the garden
    at home</art>. There decidedly is a picture in that spot. I already
    tried to get it last year.</p>

    <p>The one I made now is a rather stiff composition - to the
    right, two trees - orange and yellow; in the centre, two bushes
    of grey-green; to the left, two trees of brownish-yellow. In
    front of them the black pond - a foreground of withered grass.
    The background - a glimpse over the hedge on a very vivid
    green. A sky of slate-grey and dark blue to harmonize with this
    in strength.</p>

    <p>I am sure they will find it too black and too dark, but the
    time of making dark studies is always too short.</p>

    <p>I enclose the book by Ch. Blanc in the box with the studies,
    also a Bible which those at home gave me for you, of which I
    painted <art id=0117>a still life.</art></p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">Don't let it trouble you when in my studies I just leave the
    brush strokes as I put them on, with smaller or larger clots of
    paint. That doesn't matter at all; if one leaves them for a
    year (or half a year is enough), and then scrapes them off
    quickly with a razor, one gets a much more solid colour than
    would be the case after painting thinly. And this scraping off
    has been done by the old masters as well as by the French
    painters of today. I believe that glacis of a transparent
    colour often gets quite dark and disappears in time if they are
    applied before the picture in its preparation is thoroughly
    dry; but applied <i>later</i>, they will certainly keep.</label> You
    yourself made the observation that my studies in the studio
    became better rather than worse in colour in the course of
    time. I think this comes from laying the colours on thickly,
    and not using oil. When it is a year old, the little oil which
    the paint always contains has evaporated, and the healthy solid
    part remains. This question - that of painting so that it keeps
    - is rather important, I think; it is a pity that some durable
    colours like cobalt are so expensive.</p>

    <p>I do not know what to think of the chromates and dark
    carmines, but I can quite understand that especially the
    American sunsets - you know those kinds of paintings that are
    obtained by glacis of chromates only - last an exceedingly
    short time. Daubigny and Dupr&eacute;, on the contrary, will
    keep. Isn't it curious that that Van der Meer of Delft in The
    Hague has kept colour so splendidly, with that whole series of
    glaring tones of red, green, grey, brown, blue, black, yellow,
    white?</p>

    <p>Haverman's picture in Amsterdam, which I suppose you
    remember (as not good), is badly painted, terribly badly,
    considering the time, I fear. I just mention this because he
    especially is so much admired for <i>his technique</i>. But it
    is painted as well, I should say, as for instance Ary Scheffer
    painted, or like the technique of Delaroche - and lovers of
    healthy vigorous work have always had some objections to those
    two. I noticed in Fodor how those pictures that are smoothed
    with oil crack terribly. Yet Silvestre says that Delacroix
    bathed his pictures in oil &ldquo;<i>les baignait
    d'huile</i>&rdquo;; but I suppose that it was strongly
    <i>emp&acirc;t&eacute;</i> work, first treated <i>en pleine
    p&acirc;te, then left for a year</i>, and then <i>afterward</i>
    Delacroix drenched those pictures with oil, after they were dry
    to the core. Then it can do no harm.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Has there been no Lhermitte this month? I am longing for de
    Goncourt.</p>
