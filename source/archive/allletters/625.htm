  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just received your good news that you are a father at
    last, that Jo is over the most critical period, and finally
    that the little boy is doing well. That has done me more good
    and given me more pleasure than I can put into words. Bravo -
    and how pleased Mother will be! The day before yesterday I
    received a fairly long, very calm letter from her as well. So
    what I have been longing for so much and for such a long time
    has happened at last. No need to tell you that my thoughts have
    often turned to you of late, and it touched me very much that
    Jo had the kindness to write to me only the night before. How
    brave and calm she was at her moment of peril, it touched me
    very much.</p>

    <p>Well, it all helps a great deal in making me forget these
    last days when I was ill - at such times I no longer know where
    I am and my mind wanders.</p>

    <p>I was extremely surprised by the article on my paintings you
    sent me. No need to tell you that I hope to keep thinking that
    I don't paint like that, but I do gather from it how I ought to
    be painting. For the article is absolutely right in the way it
    shows the gap to be filled, and I think that the writer really
    wrote it to guide, not only me, but all the other
    impressionists, and even to help them make the breach in the
    right place. So he proposes an ideal collective ego to the
    others quite as much as to me. He simply tells me that here and
    there he can see something good, if you like, even in my work
    which is so imperfect, and that is the comforting part, which I
    appreciate and for which I hope I am grateful. Only it ought to
    be understood that my back is not broad enough to be saddled
    with that task, and I need not tell you that, in concentrating
    the article on me, he has made me feel steeped in flattery. In
    my opinion it is all as exaggerated as a certain article by
    Isa&auml;cson about you which claimed that
    present-day artists had given up quarrelling, and that an
    impor-tant movement was silently taking shape in the little
    shop on the Boulevard Montmartre. I admit that it is difficult
    to say what one means, to express oneself properly - just as
    one cannot paint things as one sees them - and so this isn't
    really a criticism of Isa&auml;cson's
    <i>rashness</i>, or that of the other critic, but as far as we
    are concerned, well, we are merely serving as <i>model</i>, and
    that is surely a duty and a task like any other. So, should you
    or I acquire some sort of reputation, then we must simply try
    to take it as calmly as possible, and to keep our heads.</p>

    <p>Why not say what he said of my sunflowers, and <i>with far
    greater justification</i>, of those magnificent and quite
    perfect hollyhocks of Quost's and his yellow irises, and those
    splendid peonies of Jeannin's? You know as well as I do that
    there is <i>always</i> another side of the coin to such praise.
    But I am glad, and very grateful for the article, or rather
    &ldquo;La coeur &agrave; l'aise&rdquo; [Glad at heart],
    as the revue song has it, since one may need it, as one may
    indeed have need of a coin. Moreover, an article like that has
    its own merit as a critical work of art. As such I think it is
    to he respected and the writer must raise the tone, harness his
    conclusions, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>But from the outset, you should guard against allowing your
    young family <i>too much</i> contact with the artistic world.
    Old Goupil guided his household well through the Parisian
    under-growth, and I imagine you still think of him often.
    Things have changed so much, today. His cold aloofness would
    meet resist-ance today, yet his capacity to weather so many
    storms was something special.</p>

    <p>Gauguin proposed, very vaguely it is true, that we found a
    studio in his name, he, De Haan and I, but he insisted on
    seeing his Tonkin project through first. He seems to have
    cooled off a great deal, I'm not sure exactly why, about
    continuing to paint. And he is just the kind of man to clear
    off to Tonkin, in fact he needs some room to expand, and finds
    the life of an artist - and there is some truth in this - a
    mean one.</p>

    <p>With all his experience of travel, what is one to say to
    him?</p>

    <p>So I hope that he will feel that you and I are indeed his
    friends, without counting on us too much, which, it must be
    added, he in no way does. He writes with a great deal of
    reserve, and more seriously than last year. I have just sent
    another note to Russell to jog his memory about Gauguin, for I
    know that Russell is very reliable and a sound character. And
    should I get back together with Gauguin, then we would have
    need of Russell. Gauguin and Russell are countrymen at heart -
    not uncivilized, but with the innate mellowness of distant
    fields, probably much more than you or I - that is how they
    look to me.</p>

    <p>True enough, one must sometimes have a little faith to see
    that. If I, for my part, wanted to go on with, let us call it
    the <i>translation</i> of certain pages of Millet, then to
    prevent people - not from criticizing me, that would be all
    right - but from hampering or stopping me by making out that
    all I do is produce copies - then - I need the support of
    people like Russell or Gauguin from among the artists to carry
    my project through and to make a serious job of it. I have
    scruples of conscience about doing the things by Millet you
    sent me, for example, and which seemed to me perfectly chosen,
    and so I took the pile of photographs and sent them straight to
    Russell, lest I see them again before I have thought it over. I
    don't want to do it before having heard something of what you
    and certain others think of the things you will soon be
    receiving.</p>

    <p>Else I should be having scruples of conscience, fearing that
    it might be plagiarism. And not now, but in a few months' time,
    I shall try to obtain the frank opinion of Russell himself on
    the real usefulness of the thing. In any case, Russell is on a
    short fuse, he gets angry, and says what's what, and that is
    what I sometimes need. You know that I find the Virgin so
    dazzling that <i>I haven't dared</i> look at it. I felt an
    immediate &ldquo;not yet.&rdquo; My illness makes me very
    sensitive right now, and I don't feel capable for the moment of
    continuing these `translations' when such masterpieces are
    involved. I am stopping with <art id=0689>the Sower on which I am working</art>,
    and which is not coming on as I would wish. Being ill, however,
    I have thought a great deal about going on with the work.
    <i>When</i> I do it, I do it calmly, as you will soon see when
    I send you the five or 6 finished canvases.</p>

    <p>I hope that M. Lauzet will come, I very much wish to make
    his acquaintance. I trust his opinion and when he says it [my
    painting] is Provence, he begs the question, and like the other
    critic he talks more about something yet to be done than about
    something already accomplished. Landscapes with cypresses! Ah,
    that wouldn't be easy - Aurier is aware of that, too, when he
    says that even black is a colour, and refers to their flaming
    appearance. I am thinking about it, but dare do nothing more,
    and like the cautious Isa&auml;cson, I say that I
    don't think we are there yet. One needs a dose of inspiration,
    a ray from on high that is not in ourselves, to do beautiful
    things. When I had done those Sunflowers, I looked for the
    opposite and yet the equivalent, and said - it's the
    cypress.</p>

    <p>I'm going to stop here - I am a little anxious about a
    friend who, it seems, is still ill, and whom I should like to
    see. <art id=0489>She is the one whose portrait I did in yellow and black</art>, and she
    has changed very much. She has nervous attacks, complicated by a premature change of life, in short,
    very painful. She looked like an old grandfather the last time.
    I had promised to come back in a fortnight, but was taken ill
    again myself</p>

    <p>Anyhow, as far as I'm concerned, the good news you've given
    me, and that article, and a whole lot of things have made me
    feel quite well today. I'm sorry that M. Salles did not find
    you. I want to thank Wil once again for her kind letter. I
    should have liked to have replied to it today, but am putting
    it off for a few days. Tell her that Mother has written me
    another long letter from Amsterdam. How happy she will be, Wil
    too!</p>

    <p>I am with you all in my thoughts, though ending my letter.
    May Jo long remain for us what she is now. As for the little
    boy, why don't you name him Theo, in memory of our Father, that
    would certainly give me much pleasure.</p>

    <p>A handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>In the meantime, if you see him, thank M. Aurier very much
    for his article. I shall of course he sending you a note for
    him, and a study.</p>
