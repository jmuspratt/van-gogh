  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter which I have just received. All
    the more because in this case I would rather be in the wrong
    than in the right, certainly we are absolutely and entirely in
    agreement as to the general argument of your letter. That's how
    the thing looks to me too.</p>

    <p>The news is that I think M. Salles is busy finding me an
    apartment in another part of town. I approve of this, for in
    this way I should not be obliged to move immediately - I should
    keep some sort of niche - and then I could certainly go for a
    trip to Marseilles or farther on to find something better. M.
    Salles is very kind and very loyal, and a pleasant contrast to
    others here. So there it is. That is all the news for the
    moment. If you were to write, try all the same to get them to
    give me the right to go out into the town.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">As far as I can judge, I am not properly speaking a madman.
    You will see that the canvases I have done in the intervals are
    steady and not inferior to the others. </label>I <i>miss</i> the work
    more than it tires me.</p>

    <p>Certainly I should be pleased to see Signac, if he has to
    pass through here after all. Then they must let me go out with
    him to show him my canvases.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it would have been a good thing for me to accompany
    him where he was going, and if we had tried to find a new place
    together, but there, there isn't much likelihood of that now,
    so what's the use of his putting himself out on purpose to come
    and see me?</p>

    <p>There is one very good thing in your letter, where you say
    that one must not let oneself have any illusions about
    life.</p>

    <p>The thing is to put up with the real facts of your destiny,
    and then there you are. I am writing in haste to send off this
    letter, which will, however, perhaps only reach you on Sunday,
    when Signac will have already left. I can't help it. All I
    would ask is that people whom I do not even know by name (for
    they took good care to arrange that I should not know who sent
    the letter in question) do not meddle with me when I am busy
    painting, or eating, or sleeping, or taking a turn at the
    brothel, since I haven't a wife. Now they are meddling with
    everything. But in spite of everything, I wouldn't give a damn
    if it weren't for the grief that I am very unwillingly causing
    you, or rather that they are causing - and for the delay in my
    work.</p>

    <p>If they should continue, these repeated and unexpected
    agitations may change a passing and momentary mental
    disturbance into a chronic disease.</p>

    <p>Believe me, if nothing intervenes, I shall now be able to do
    the same and perhaps better work in the orchards than I did
    last year.</p>

    <p>Now let us be as firm as possible and, in short, not let
    them tread too painfully on our toes. From the start I have
    been faced with very mischievous opposition here. All this stir
    will naturally be good for &ldquo;impressionism,&rdquo; but you
    and I as individuals will suffer because of a pack of skunks
    and cowards.</p>

    <p>There is some reason for keeping your indignation to
    yourself, isn't there? I have already seen in a paper here a
    really good article on decadent or impressionist
    literature.</p>

    <p>But what are these articles in papers, etc., to you or me?
    As my good friend Roulin says, &ldquo;It is to act as a
    pedestal for others.&rdquo; But at least you would like to know
    for whom or for what, wouldn't you, then you could have no
    objection. But to be on a pedestal for something you do not
    know, that is trying.</p>

    <p>After all this for nothing, provided you go straight to your
    goal - a secure home for you is a great gain for me too - and
    that done, we can perhaps find another, more peaceful, way of
    settling things after your marriage. If sooner or later I
    should really go mad, I think I should not want to stay on here
    at the hospital, but just now I want to come and go freely.</p>

    <p>The best thing for me would certainly be not to live alone,
    but I would rather live in a cell forever than sacrifice
    another life to mine. For this business of painting is a sorry
    poor job nowadays. If I were a Roman Catholic, I should have
    the resource of turning monk, but not being precisely that way,
    as you know, I haven't that resource. The management of the
    hospital is - how shall I say? - Jesuit, they are very, very
    able, very clever, very powerful, they are even
    impressionistic, they know how to make inquiries of an unheard
    of subtlety, but - but that amazes and confounds me - and
    yet&hellip;</p>

    <p>In fact this is, in a way, the cause of my silence, so keep
    aloof from me in business, and meanwhile I am a man after all,
    so you know I will shift for myself in matters of conscience
    which concern myself alone.</p>

    <p>I shake your hand in thought. Tell your fianc&eacute;e
    and our mother and sister not to worry about me and to believe
    that I am on the high road to recovery.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
