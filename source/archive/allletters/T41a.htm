    <p>Paris, 22 July 1890 <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Jo has sent your letter, which followed us to Holland, to me
    and I have read it with a little surprise <sup>2</sup>. Where
    did you see these violent domestic quarrels? That we were very
    tired by these interminable preoccupations on the subject of
    the future of us all, yes, that with this affair vis-a-vis the
    house, about which I am unsure if it is in my own best
    interest, yes, but truly I don't see these intense domestic
    quarrels that you talk about. Was it the discussion with Dries?
    Certainly I had hoped to see a bit more audacity in him in
    undertaking something, but he is like that and there is no
    reason to break with him. Is it perhaps, but I really do not
    believe it, that you consider it an intense domestic quarrel
    when Jo asked you not to put the Pr&eacute;vost <sup>3</sup> up
    where you wanted to hang it? She did not mean to hurt you with
    this and would certainly have preferred that you leave it there
    rather than anger you. Her child preoccupies her too much for
    her to have much time to think about paintings and no matter
    that she sees things better than she used to, she does not
    always understand what the painting means. No, if it was this
    trifling matter, I tell you to stop it because it is not worth
    worrying about. I hope, my dear Vincent, that your health is
    good, and since you say that you write with difficulty, and
    don't talk about your work I am a little afraid that there is
    something troubling you or not going right. In this case drop
    in to see Dr. Gachet, he will give you something to make you
    feel better. Give me your news as soon as possible. Last
    Tuesday [15 July] I took Jo and the child to Leiden and stayed
    there until Thursday. Mother is well, a little older, but she
    was so happy to see her little boy and it was fun to see her
    pick him up and how happy it made her. Wil is also fine and was
    very kind to us. Jo stayed there [again?] for a day after I
    left and then she went on to Amsterdam, where she is now. I
    hope that everyone tries a little not to be so tired, but that
    everyone gets a little rest, we all need it for it is a duty I
    assure you.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the weather there, as it is here, is
    unsettled, with the result that she cannot get much fresh air,
    nor can the child either. I think that if it were possible she
    wants to return home sooner than we had planned, but on the
    other hand it is good that she likes her home here more than
    her parent's house. I will be very happy when she returns
    because the house is so empty! And the little one misses me
    too. Our lives, justified by this child, are so closely linked
    that you do not have to fear that a small difference of
    opinion, if you saw any, would cause any rift that would be
    difficult to reconcile. Therefore, don't think about it any
    more. My travelling in Holland has done me good, and has given
    me a lot of rest, which I really needed. Hope the health is
    good. Enclosed I send you 50-fr. - write to me quickly and
    believe me your brother who loves you,</p>

    <p>Theo</p>

        <p>Theo said (T41) that he was leaving for Leiden on
        Tuesday 15<sup>th</sup> July 1890, from there he was going
        to Mesdag on Wednesday and then on to Antwerp; he would be
        gone about eight days. Thus he should have been back in
        Paris on the 23<sup>rd</sup> or 24<sup>th</sup> of the
        month. Since this letter is dated Tuesday the
        22<sup>nd</sup>, and is obviously written in Paris, he must
        have returned sooner than he expected.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="2">
        <p>In view of what Theo says of this letter, it cannot be
        reconciled with any of Vincent's existing letters. Letter
        651 is obviously in reply to this one, and the previous
        letter to Jo and Theo, 649, of about the 10<sup>th</sup>
        July, does not mention any &ldquo;violentes querelles
        domestiques&rdquo; [violent domestic quarrels].</p>
      </li>

      <li value="3">
        <p>In letter 648 Vincent says that the paintings owned by
        him and Theo of other artists, stored at Tanguy's,
        including the Pr&eacute;vost, were &ldquo;going to ruin
        there.&rdquo;</p>
