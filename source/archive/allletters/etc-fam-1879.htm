    <p>From Reverend Van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>20 January 1879</p>

    <p>We are glad to be able to tell you that Vincent has been
    accepted for the evangelization in the Borinage - provisionally
    for six months. He gets fifty francs a month - surely not much,
    but his boarding house costs him thirty francs. It seems he
    works there with success and ambition, and his letters are
    really interesting. He devotes himself to that job with all his
    heart and an eye for the needs of those people. It is certainly
    remarkable what he writes; he went down, for instance, in a
    mine, 635 meters.</p>

    <p>From Reverend Van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>12 February 1879</p>

    <p>We are beginning to worry about him again. I am afraid he is
    wholly absorbed by the care for the sick and the wounded and by
    sitting up with them.</p>

    <p>[&hellip;] He also spoke about a plan of renting a workman's
    house and living there alone. We have tried to dissuade him
    from it. We are afraid he would not keep it in good shape and
    it would again lead to eccentricities.</p>

    <p>From Mrs. Van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>27 February 1879</p>

    <p>Verhaegen, a colporteur, to whom Pa also sent his letters in
    the beginning, where Vincent had been lovingly received during
    the first eight days; he was the one who had found that good
    boarding house at Denis.</p>

    <p>[&hellip;] And now I have to tell you that Pa has gone to
    Vincent this week. We were worried about all the bad weather he
    had, and especially because while I was away, there had been a
    very unpleasant letter from him, confirming what we had already
    suspected, that he had no bed, and that there was nobody to
    watch his things but far from complaining he said that that was
    nobody's concern, etc. We were preparing a parcel for him, but
    we both thought that it would be so much better if Pa himself
    would take it to him.</p>

    <p>Mrs. van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>May 1879</p>

    <p>Vincent wrote that he would do his best to draw costumes and
    tools.</p>

    <p>Mrs. van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>2 July 1879</p>

    <p>This week a letter from Vincent; we are always thinking
    about him with anxiety; poor boy, shortly after my visit to him
    he wrote that he had such a melancholy feeling when we said
    goodbye, as if it could have been for the first, but also for
    the last time. But now there has been a meeting, but that they
    hadn't said anything to him; before, they had always found
    fault with him. We have the idea they still want to wait and
    see for some time, but if he doesn't suit himself to their
    wishes and adopt the behaviour they demand of him, they can't
    accept him. He could still achieve so much, if only he knew how
    to control himself. Poor boy, what a difficult, unrewarding,
    much missing young life, and what is he going to do next?</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>19 July 1879</p>

    <p>You know, don't you? that Vincent's situation in Wasmes does
    not become any clearer. They have given him three months to
    look for something else. He does not comply with the wishes of
    the Committee and it seems that nothing can be done about it.
    It is a bitter trial for us. We literally don't know what to
    do. There is so much good in him, but he simply doesn't want to
    cooperate.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>7 August 1879</p>

    <p>Last Friday [25 July], Vincent writes, he started on a trip
    to Maria Hoorebeeke in Flanders; he arrived there - on foot -
    on Sunday afternoon, intending to meet the Reverend Pietersen,
    who was in Brussels. Thereupon he went to that city, and he met
    him on Monday morning. After consultation with him, he is now
    in Cuesmes again, where he has found shelter; he hopes to find
    a small room there to stay for the time being. At present his
    address is: Chez M. Frank, Evang&eacute;liste
    &Atilde;&nbsp; Cuesmes (pr&eacute;s de Mons) au Marais.
    In Brussels, he visited the families he had met there earlier -
    what impression will he have made?</p>

    <p>From Mrs. Van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>19 August 1879</p>

    <p>But now I must tell you something new, which is that
    Vincent, after much pressure from our side to visit us at home
    because we were worrying so much about him and he had nothing
    to do there, suddenly stood before us last Friday [August
    15<sup>th</sup>]. The girls were boating with the Gezink
    family, and all at once we hear, &ldquo;Hello father, hello
    mother,&rdquo; and there he was.<label content="lifestyle.appearance"> We were glad; although seeing
    him again we found he looked thin; that is over now; it must
    have been the walking and bad food etc. - things, by the way,
    he does not talk about, but he looks well, except for his
    clothes.</label><label content="lifestyle.clothing"> Pa immediately gave him his cherished new jacket. We
    bought him a pair of boots, and he now wears the little summer
    coat that I made for Pa's birthday every day. Some of your old
    underwear came in useful too, and as far as stockings, etc.,
    are concerned, I had prepared them in advance, so that now he
    is quite well taken care of.</label> He is reading books by Dickens all
    day long, and does not speak apart from giving answers -
    sometimes correct, sometimes strange ones; if only he adopted
    the good things from these books. For the rest, about his work,
    about the past or the future, not a word&hellip;Tomorrow, he
    and Pa will go to Prinsenhage, where CM's boys will come to see
    the paintings; they are going by train. Pa and Vincent will go
    on foot, maybe he will talk a little bit then.</p>

    <p>From Reverend Van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>11 March 1880</p>

    <p>Vincent is still here - but alas! it is nothing but worry.
    Now he is talking about going to London in order to speak with
    the Reverend Jones. If he sticks to that plan, I'll enable him
    to go, but it is hopeless.</p>

    <p>From Reverend Van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>5 July 1880</p>

    <p>Indeed that letter Vincent wrote to you gave me some
    pleasure. But oh! What will become of him, and isn't it insane
    to choose a life of poverty and let time pass by without
    looking for an occasion of earning one's own bread - yes, that
    really is insane. But we have to put up with it. None of all
    the things we tried has helped in any way. Maybe you should
    write back to him; in the last days of June I sent him 60
    francs, which he acknowledged; some time later we sent him some
    clothes. Thinking of him always hurts, and we do think so
    continuously of him.</p>

    <p>[Lines added by Mrs. Van Gogh] We can agree with what you
    write about Vincent, but if reading books gives such practical
    results, can it then be called right? And for the rest, what
    kind of ideas his reading gives him. He sent us a book by
    Victor Hugo, but that man takes the side of the criminals and
    doesn't call bad what really is bad. What would the world look
    like if one calls the evil good? Even with the best of
    intentions that cannot be accepted. Did you answer him? If not,
    do so in any case; we were so glad that he thought of you, and
    we were so sad that he didn't want to have anything to do with
    anybody when he was here. We haven't heard from him for a long
    time now and shall write to him again.</p>
