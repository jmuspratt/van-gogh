  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>My hearty thanks for your letter, and the 200 francs
    enclosed. Thanks for giving the size of the frame, in which I
    intend to make a little woman spinning, after the large
    study.</p>

    <p>I was glad to hear some good news about Breitner. The last
    impressions I had of him were, as you know, rather
    unfavourable, because of three large canvases which I saw at
    his studio, and in which I literally did not distinguish
    anything that might be located either in reality or in an
    imaginary world. But a few watercolours which he then had on
    hand, horses in the dunes, though very sketchy, were much
    better. And I saw things in it which make me understand quite
    well that the picture of which you speak must be good. As to
    the Society of Draughtsmen, firstly, I quite forgot it because
    I was busy painting those figures; secondly, now that your
    letter reminds me of it, I am not very keen on it, for, as I
    told you already last summer, I can only expect a refusal of my
    petition for membership, which refusal one can, however,
    consider as a kind of necessary evil that can be redressed next
    year and as such the request perhaps has its raison
    d'&ecirc;tre.</p>

    <p>Besides, as I quite forgot it, I have not one watercolour on
    hand, and should have to start new ones in a hurry, if it were
    not already too late for this year.</p>

    <p>And when I tell you that I am just now quite absorbed again
    in two new large studies of interiors of weavers, you will
    understand I am in no mood for it. Especially as it might cause
    new disagreements if I applied again to the gentlemen at The
    Hague.</p>

    <p>As to these two treatments of weavers, <art id=0024>one shows a part of
    the loom, with the figure and a small window</art>.</p>

    <p><art id=0037>The other is an interior, with three small windows, looking
    out on the yellowish verdure, contrasting with the blue of the
    cloth that is being woven on the loom, and the blouse of the
    weaver, which is again of another blue</art>.</p>

    <p>But what struck me most in nature of late I have not started
    on yet, for want of a good model. The half-ripe cornfields are
    at present of a dark golden tone, ruddy or gold bronze. This is
    raised to a maximum of effect by opposition to the broken
    cobalt tone of the sky.</p>

    <p>Imagine in such a background women's figures, very rough,
    very energetic, with sun-bronzed faces and arms and feet, with
    dusty, coarse indigo clothes and a black bonnet in the form of
    a barrette on their short-cut hair; while on the way to their
    work they pass between the corn along a dusty path of ruddy
    violet, with some green weeds, carrying hoes on their
    shoulders, or a loaf of black bread under the arm - a pitcher
    or brass coffee kettle. I have seen that same subject
    repeatedly of late, with all kinds of variations. And I assure
    you that it was really impressive.</p>

    <p>Very rich, and at the same time very sober, delicately
    artistic. And I am quite absorbed in it.</p>

    <p>But my colour bill has run up so high that I must be wary of
    starting new things in a big size, the more so because it will
    cost me much in models; if I could only get suitable models,
    just of the type I want (rough, flat faces with low foreheads
    and thick lips, not sharp, but full and Millet-like) and with
    those very same clothes.</p>

    <p>For it demands great exactness, and one is not at liberty to
    deviate from the colours of the costume, as the effect lies in
    the analogy of the broken indigo tone with the broken cobalt
    tone, intensified by the secret elements of orange in the
    reddish bronze of the corn.</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">It would be a thing that gave a good impression of summer. I
    think summer is not easy to express; generally, at least often,
    a summer effect is either impossible or ugly, at least I think
    so, but then, as opposition, there is the twilight.</p>

    <p>But I mean to say that it is not easy to find a summer sun
    effect which is as rich and as simple, and as pleasant to look
    at as the characteristic effects of the other seasons.</p>

    <p>Spring is tender, green young corn and pink apple
    blossoms.</p>

    <p>Autumn is the contrast of the yellow leaves against violet
    tones.</p>

    <p>Winter is the snow with black silhouettes.</p>

    <p>But now, if summer is the opposition of blues against an
    element of orange, in the gold bronze of the corn, one could
    paint a picture which expressed the mood of the seasons in each
    of the contrasts of the complementary colours (red and green,
    blue and orange, yellow and violet, white and black.</label></p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">Well, I am longing to hear about your journey to London,
    etc.</label></p>

    <p>Mother is making but little progress in walking. Goodbye,
    and once more thanks for your letter and the enclosed. Believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>The best thing I know - for the frame - is to take a few
    stretchers of that size, then we can see which turns out
    best.</p>
