  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>The thing in our conversation that makes me utterly
    disconsolate was that, when I said I was afraid that you would
    have a hard nut to crack during the current year, you answered
    that &ldquo;you had observed I should like to see this happen,
    that you see quite clearly that you cannot count on me, and
    that you know all right that I shall reward you with stinking
    ingratitude.&rdquo; This is not true, and I am disconsolate
    that you see it that way.</p>

    <p>Let me give you this hint: don't consider this painting
    business of mine a burden, and don't treat it in a stepmotherly
    way, because it may prove to be <i>a little lifeboat</i> when
    the big ship is wrecked. My hint is now, and will be in the
    future: Let's try and keep the little boat trim and seaworthy,
    whether the tempest comes, or my uneasiness proves unfounded.
    At present I am a tiny vessel which you have in tow, and which
    at times will seem to you so much ballast. But this - I mean
    the ballast - you may leave behind by cutting the towrope, if
    you like&hellip;But I, who am the skipper of my tiny vessel,
    ask in this case that - far from having the towrope cut - that
    my little boat be kept trim and well provisioned, in order that
    I may do better service in times of need.</p>

    <p>If you doubt the good faith of this request, then the only
    thing for me to do is to repeat it even more urgently. For I
    perceive that in the matter of my colour bill my little vessel
    is leaking here and there. However, I am trying to stop these
    leaks to the best of my ability, and I have not lost my
    self-command yet. Neither am I desperate. But considering that
    both of us may be overtaken by the same tempest, I am speaking
    concretely and, as far as I can see, in our mutual
    interest.</p>

    <p>I can summarize your answer to my question thus: it may be
    that there will be a tempest, but even in that case don't count
    on repairs or provisions, and bear in mind that under the
    pressure of certain circumstances I may feel obliged to cut the
    towrope.</p>

    <p><i>This</i> answer I must accept, but only as long as it is
    not aggravated by doubting my good faith.</p>

    <p>However, with this letter I cry out to you once more that my
    request for reinforcement may prove to be in both our
    interests, and I do not make it out of selfishness, as you
    suppose. That in case of a tempest, <i>I shall be willing, and
    perhaps able</i>, to be of some use and service to you, but
    that this will be impossible if my own vessel is swamped (a
    thing I try to prevent) before the critical moment. This,
    however, is a thing I seek to stave off myself, but I should
    not cry out to you without necessity. I am not afraid in the
    midst of danger either, but I try to be ready at the moment of
    distress.</p>

    <p>It may be that you don't think it reasonable of me to insist
    on <i>my</i> - and I should much prefer to say <i>our</i> -
    little painting business becoming the centre of a larger
    business which we might undertake together later on; but I for
    my part persist in claiming that something will and
    <i>shall</i> come of it, if only we remain sufficiently
    united.</p>

    <p>If I haven't the same ideas as you, don't suspect me of bad
    faith or of evil intentions, either toward you or toward those
    at home. <label content="attitude.family">With regard to those at home I do nothing that I have
    no right to do, seeing that I refrain strictly and permanently
    from interfering in their affairs, or from obtruding either my
    advice or any questions, and remain absolutely on my own ground
    - and that I even keep back my opinions of their affairs, as in
    point of fact we do not understand each other's interests.</label></p>

    <p>And to you I speak, and I shall go on speaking, as one
    person dealing in pictures to another person dealing in
    pictures, and <i>I will not trespass</i> on the other
    territory.</p>

    <p>And the question I started discussing with you is that
    however great the depression may be, and however much trouble
    we shall have to take, we must try energetically to push
    forward the little painting business that belongs to you as
    much as to me.</p>

    <p>I say it may be a lifeboat which may be of use to you in the
    tempest, although I don't wish for this tempest any more than
    you can wish for it.</p>

    <p>Goodbye.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
