  <body>
    <p>72 Boulevard du Midi</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>In answer to your letter I will tell you a few things.</p>

    <p>First, I went to see Mr. Roelofs the day after receiving
    your letter. He told me that in his opinion from now on I must
    draw principally from nature, that is, from either plaster cast
    or model, but not without the guidance of someone who knows it
    well. He - and others too - have advised me so earnestly to go
    and work at the academy, either here or in Antwerp or wherever
    I can, that I felt obliged to try to get admitted to the said
    academy, though I don't think it so very pleasant.</p>

    <p><i>Here in Brussels the teaching is free of charge</i> (in
    Amsterdam, for instance, I hear it costs 100 guilders a year)
    and one can work in a well-heated and well-lighted room, which
    is good, especially in winter.</p>

    <p>I get on very well with the Bargues, I am making
    progress.</p>

    <p>Besides that, lately I have been busy drawing something that
    took a lot of work, but still I am glad I have done it: I drew
    a rather large-sized skeleton with pen and ink on five sheets
    of Ingres paper.</p>

    <p>1 page: the head, bones and muscle.</p>

    <p>1 page: the torso, bones.</p>

    <p>1 page: the hand, front view, bones and muscle.</p>

    <p>1 page: the hand, back view, bones and muscle.</p>

    <p>1 page: the pelvis and legs, bones.</p>

    <p>I got the idea of making these from a textbook by John:
    Sketches of the anatomy for artist's use. There are some
    reproductions in it which seem to me very good and clear, of
    the hand, the foot, etc. etc. And what I am going to do now is
    finish drawing the muscles, that is, of the torso and the legs,
    which with the others will form the whole of the human body.
    Then follows the back and side view of the body. So you see, I
    am going ahead with a will: these things are not so easy - they
    take time and a great deal of patience besides.</p>

    <p>In order to be admitted to the academy of drawing one must
    have the Mayor's permission and be registered. I am waiting for
    the answer to my request. I know quite well that no matter how
    economically or poorly one may live, life here in Brussels must
    be more expensive; but I cannot get on without some
    instruction, and I think if only I work hard, which I do,
    possibly Uncle Vincent or Uncle Cor will do something - if not
    to help me, at least to help Father.</p>

    <p>From the veterinarian school I intend to get pictures of the
    anatomy, for instance, of a horse, a cow, or sheep, and draw
    them the way I did the anatomy of the human body.</p>

    <p>There are laws of proportion, of light and shadow, of
    perspective, which one must know in order to be able to draw
    well; without that knowledge, it always remains a fruitless
    struggle, and one never creates anything. Therefore I think I
    was right in acting as I did, and this winter I will try to lay
    in some capital of anatomy; I cannot put it off any longer - in
    the end it would prove more expensive, for it would be loss of
    time.</p>

    <p>I believe this will also be your point of view.</p>

    <p>It is a hard and difficult struggle to learn to draw
    well.</p>

    <p>If I might find some permanent work here, so much the
    better; but I dare not count on it, for I still have many
    things to learn.</p>

    <p>Have also been to see Mr. Van Rappard, who now lives at Rue
    Traversi&egrave;re 6a, and had a talk with him. He is a
    fine-looking man; of his work I saw only a few pen-and-ink
    drawings of landscapes. But judging from the way he lives he
    must be quite wealthy, and I do not know whether he is the
    person with whom someone like me could live and work, for
    financial reasons. But I certainly shall go and see him again
    some time. He impressed me as one who takes things
    seriously.</p>

    <p>In Cuesmes, boy, I should have fallen ill with misery, if I
    had stayed a month longer. <label subject="food-and-drink.preference">You must not imagine that I live
    richly here, for my chief food is dry bread or some potatoes or
    chestnuts which people sell here on the street corners, but by
    having a somewhat better room and by occasionally taking a
    somewhat better meal in a restaurant whenever I can afford it</label>,
    I shall get on very well. But for almost two years I have had a
    hard time in the Borinage - it was no pleasure trip, I assure
    you. The expenses here will be somewhat more than 60 fr., which
    cannot be helped. Drawing materials, studies to copy - for
    instance, for anatomy - all cost money, and yet they are
    strictly necessary: only in this way shall I obtain a fair
    return, otherwise I could never succeed.</p>

    <p>The other day I read with great pleasure an extract from the
    work of Lavater and Gall, Physiognomy and Phrenology, namely,
    how character is expressed in the features and in the shape of
    the skull. I have drawn &ldquo;The Diggers&rdquo; by Millet,
    from a Braun photograph which I found at Schmidt's and which he
    lent me, together with that of &ldquo;The Angelus.&rdquo; I
    sent both these drawings to Father so he might see I am
    working.</p>

    <p>Write again soon, address 72 <i>Bd. Du Midi</i>. I am here
    in a small hotel for 50 fr. a month, including my bread and a
    cup of coffee morning, afternoon and evening. That is not very
    cheap, but it is expensive everywhere. Those Holbeins in The
    Models from the Masters are splendid. Now that I am drawing
    them, I feel it even more strongly than before. But I assure
    you, they are not easy.</p>

    <p>When I went to see Mr. Schmidt, I hadn't the slightest idea
    that he was involved in a money question which concerned the
    Van Gogh family, for which reason he, Mr. Schmidt, was going to
    be sued; I only learned it from your letter. So that was rather
    bad luck, though I must say Mr. Schmidt received me rather
    cordially. But since I do know it now and things are the way
    they are, it will perhaps be wise not to go there often, though
    I do not see the necessity of avoiding him intentionally.</p>

    <p>I should have written sooner, but was too busy with my
    skeleton. I believe the longer you think it over, the more you
    will see the urgent necessity of more artistic surroundings for
    me - how can one learn to draw if nobody shows one how? With
    all the best intentions in the world, one cannot succeed
    without coming into contact with artists who are more advanced.
    Good intentions alone are not sufficient without some
    opportunity for development.</p>

    <p>As to your thinking I should not want to be among the
    mediocre artists, what shall I say? it quite depends on what
    you call mediocre. I shall do what I can, but I do not at all
    despise <i>mediocre</i> in its simple sense. And one certainly
    does not rise above the mark by despising what is mediocre. In
    my opinion one must at least begin by having some respect for
    the mediocre, and know that it already means something, and is
    only reached with great difficulty.</p>

    <p>Adieu, for the present, I shake hands with you in thought.
    Write soon if possible,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
