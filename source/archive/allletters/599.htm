  <body>
    <p>Dear brother and sister,</p>

    <p>Jo's letter told me a very great piece of news this morning,
    I congratulate you on it and I am very glad to hear it. I was
    much touched by your thought when you said that neither of you
    being in such good health as seems desirable on such an
    occasion, you felt a sort of doubt, and in any case that a
    feeling of pity for the child who is to come passed through
    your heart. Has the child in this case even before its birth
    been less loved than the child of very healthy parents, whose
    first movement must have been quick with joy? Certainly not. We
    know life so little that it is very little in our power to
    distinguish right from wrong, just from unjust, and to say that
    one is unfortunate because one suffers, which has not been
    proved. Remember that Roulin's child came to them smiling and
    very healthy when the parents were in straits. So take it as it
    comes, wait in confidence and possess your soul with great
    patience, as a very old saying has it, and with good will.
    Leave nature alone. <label content="Theo.health">As for what you say about Theo's health,
    although, my dear sister, I share your anxiety with all my
    heart, I must comfort you, just because I have realized that
    his health is, like mine too, more changeable and uneven than
    feeble.</label></p>

    <p>I very much like to think that illness sometimes heals us,
    that is to say, when the discomfort comes to a crisis, it is
    necessary for the recovery of the body's normal condition. No,
    after he has been married for some time, he will recover his
    strength, as he still has a reserve of youth and power to
    restore him.</p>

    <p>I am very glad that he is not alone, and truly I do not
    doubt but that after some time he will recover his old
    temperament. And then above all, when he is a father and the
    sense of fatherhood has come to him, it will be so much
    gained.</p>

    <p>In my life as a painter, and especially when I am in the
    country, it is less difficult for me to be alone, because in
    the country you feel more easily the ties that unite us all.
    But in town, as he has been for ten years on end with the
    Goupils in Paris, it is impossible to exist alone. So with
    patience it will all come back.</p>

    <p>I am going to Arles tomorrow to get the canvases which are
    still there, and which I will send you soon. And I am going to
    send some of them as soon as possible to try to give you, even
    though you are in town, a peasant's thoughts.</p>

    <p>This morning I talked a little with the doctor here - he
    told me exactly what I already thought - that I must wait a
    year before thinking myself cured, since the least little thing
    might bring on another attack.</p>

    <p>Then he offered to store my furniture here, so that we
    should not be paying double. Tomorrow I am going to Arles to
    talk it over with M. Salles. When I came here, I left M. Salles
    50 francs to pay the hospital in Arles; he is sure to have some
    of it left. But as I was still pretty often in need of various
    things here, the surplus which M. Peyron had is exhausted. I am
    rather surprised, myself, that while I have been living with
    the greatest possible frugality and regularity for six months,
    not counting having my studio free, I spend no less and produce
    no more than the previous year, which was comparatively less
    frugal, and inwardly I feel neither more nor less remorseful,
    as it is called. That is as much as to say that what is called
    good and bad is, however - as it seems to me - pretty
    relative.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.alcohol">I live soberly because I have a chance to, I drank
    in the past because I did not quite know how to do otherwise. Anyway,
    I don't care in the least!!! Very deliberate sobriety - it's
    true - leads nevertheless to a condition in which thoughts, if
    you have any, move more readily. In short, it is a difference
    like painting in grey or in colours. I am going to paint more
    in grey, in fact.</label></p>

    <p>Only instead of paying money to a landlord, you give it to
    the asylum, I do not see the difference - and it is hardly any
    cheaper. The work is a thing apart and has always cost me a
    lot.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">Thank you very much for the package of colours and canvas,
    which I am very glad to have.</label> I hope to go and do the olives
    again. Unfortunately there are very few vineyards here.<label content="health.general"> I am
    well, however, and I have a feeling rather like I had when I
    was younger, when I was very sober, <i>too</i> sober they used
    to say then, I think.</label> But it doesn't matter, I shall try to
    overcome my difficulties.</p>

    <p>As for being godfather to a son of yours, when to begin with
    it may be a daughter, honestly, in the circumstances I would
    rather wait until I am away from here.</p>

    <p>Then Mother would certainly rather set her heart on its
    being called after our father. I for one would think that more
    logical in the circumstances.</p>

    <p>I enjoyed myself very much yesterday reading <i>Measure for
    Measure.</i> Then I read <i>Henry VIII,</i> in which there
    are such fine passages, such as that of Buckingham, and
    Wolsey's words after his fall.</p>

    <p>I think that I am lucky to be able to read or reread this at
    leisure and then I very much hope to read Homer too at
    last.</p>

    <p>Outside the cicadas are singing fit to burst, a harsh
    screeching, ten times stronger than that of the crickets, and
    the scorched grass takes on lovely tones of old gold. And the
    beautiful towns of the South are in the same state as our dead
    towns along the Zuyder Zee that once were so bustling. Yet in
    the decline and decadence of things, the cicadas dear to the
    good Socrates abide. And here certainly they still sing in
    ancient Greek. If our friend Isa&auml;cson heard
    them, it would certainly rejoice his heart.</p>

    <p>What Jo writes about your having all your meals at home is
    splendid. Altogether I think it is all going very well, and
    once more, while sharing with all my heart all possible
    uneasiness about Theo's health, with me the hope predominates
    that in this case a more or less sickly condition is only the
    result of nature's efforts to right herself. Patience. Mauve
    always asserted that nature was good and even much more so than
    is generally believed; was there anything in his life that
    proves he was wrong? The fits of depression during his last
    days, do you think? I should be inclined to think
    otherwise.</p>

    <p>Good-bye for the present, but I wanted to write straight off
    and tell you how pleased I am with this morning's news.</p>

    <p>A handshake from</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
