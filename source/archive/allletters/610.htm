  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just brought back a canvas on which I have been
    working for some time, representing the same field again as in
    <art id=0617>the &ldquo;Reaper.&rdquo;</art> <art id=0641>Now it is clods of earth and the
    background of parched land, then the rocks of the Alpines. A
    bit of green-blue sky with a little white and violet cloud. In
    the foreground a thistle and some dry grass. A peasant dragging
    a truss of straw in the middle. It is again a
    harsh study, and instead of being almost entirely yellow, it
    makes a picture almost entirely violet. Broken violet and
    neutral tints</art>. But I am writing you because I think this will
    complement the &ldquo;Reaper&rdquo; and will make clearer what
    that is. For the &ldquo;Reaper&rdquo; looks as though it were
    done at random, and this will give it balance. As soon as it is
    dry, I shall send it along with <art id=0483>the copy of the bedroom</art>. I
    earnestly beg you to show them <i>together</i> if anyone sees
    the studies, because of the contrast of the
    complementaries.</p>

    <p>Then this week I have also done <art id=0635>the &ldquo;Entrance to a
    Quarry,&rdquo;</art> which is like something Japanese; you remember there are Japanese drawings
    of rocks with grass growing on them here and there and little trees.</p>

    <p>From time to time there are moments when nature is superb,
    autumn effects glorious in colour, green skies contrasting with
    foliage in yellows, oranges, greens, earth in all the violets,
    heat-withered grass among which, however, the rains have given
    a last energy to certain plants, which again start putting
    forth little flowers of violet, pink, blue, yellow. Things that
    one is quite sad not to be able to reproduce.</p>

    <p>And skies - like our skies in the North, but the colours of
    the sunsets and sunrises more varied and clearer. Like in a
    Jules Dupr&eacute; or a Ziem.</p>

    <p>I also have <art id=0642>two views</art> of <art id=0643>the park and the asylum</art>, where
    this place looked very pleasing. I tried to reconstruct the thing as
    it might have been, simplifying and accentuating the haughty,
    unchanging character of the pines and cedar clumps against the
    blue.</p>

    <p>Anyway - if it should be that they remember me, which is a
    matter of indifference to me - there will be something in
    colour to send to the Vingtistes. But I am indifferent to that.
    What I am not indifferent to is that a man who is very much my
    superior, Meunier, has painted the
    &ldquo;Scl&ocirc;neuses&rdquo; of the Borinage and the
    shift going to the pits, and the factories, their red roofs and
    their black chimneys against a delicate grey sky - all things
    that I have dreamed of doing, feeling that it had not been done
    and that it ought to be painted. And still there is an infinity
    of subjects there for artists, and one ought to go down into
    the mine, and paint the light effects.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">If you have not yet sent off the canvas and the paints, I
    must tell you that at present I have absolutely no canvas. And
    I was going to ask you, in case you find it difficult to send
    the total of what I owe M. Peyron at once, if it were possible
    to send me a money order for 15 francs or so, so I could go to
    Arles one of these days.</label></p>

    <p>I often think that Gauguin would have lost nothing by
    staying here, for I can see clearly in the letter he has
    written me that he is not altogether at the top of his form
    either. And I know quite well what that is due to - they are
    too hard up to get models, and can't have been living as
    cheaply as they first expected. However, if he has patience,
    next year may perhaps be splendid, but then he will not have
    Bernard with him, if he is in the army.</p>

    <p>Don't you feel now that the figures by Jules Breton and
    Billet and others <i>will remain?</i> Those men overcame the
    difficulty of models, and that is a great deal. And a picture
    by Otto Weber of the good period (not of the English) will
    certainly hold its own too. One swallow doesn't make a summer,
    and a new idea does not destroy finished and perfect work. That
    is the terrible thing about the impressionists, that the
    development of the thing hangs fire, and for years they remain
    held up by obstacles which the previous generation triumphed
    over, the difficulty of money and models. And so Breton, Billet
    and others might well make a joke of it and say in surprise,
    &ldquo;But look here, when shall we see these country men and
    women of yours?&rdquo; As for myself, I feel a disgrace and a
    failure.</p>

    <p>I have copied that <art id=0644>&ldquo;Woman with a Child Sitting by a
    Hearth,&rdquo; by Mme. Dumont Breton, almost all in violet</art>. I am certainly going
    on copying, that will give me a collection of my own, and when this is large and complete
    enough, I shall give the whole to a school. I can also inform
    you that in the next package you'll become better acquainted
    with good Tartarin's Alpines than you are now. Apart from the
    canvas of the &ldquo;Mountains,&rdquo; you have not seen them
    yet except in the background of the canvases.</p>

    <p>I have <art id=0645>a sterner study than the previous one of the
    mountains. A very wild ravine where a small stream winds its
    way along its bed of rocks. It is all violet.</art>
    I could certainly do a whole series of these Alpines, for
    having seen them for a long time now, I am more up to it. You
    remember that fine landscape by Monticelli which we saw at
    Delarebeyrette's, of a tree on some rocks against a sunset?
    There are many effects like that just now, only I can never be
    outside at the hour of sunset, but for that I should have tried
    one of them.</p>

    <p>Is Jo's health still good? I think that altogether this year
    has been happier for you than the previous ones. As for me, I
    am feeling well just now.<label content="health.mental"> I think M. Peyron is right when he
    says that I am not strictly speaking mad, for my mind is
    absolutely normal in the intervals, and even more so than
    before. But during the attacks it is terrible - and then I lose
    consciousness of everything.</label> But that spurs me on to work and
    to seriousness, like a miner who is always in danger makes
    haste in what he does.</p>

    <p>Mother and our sister will be getting ready to move.</p>

    <p>I am enclosing a few words for Isa&auml;cson,
    Bernard and Gauguin. There is no hurry of course about sending
    it on to them, the first time they come to see you will do. In
    the evening I am bored to death. Good Lord, the prospect of
    winter isn't very cheery.</p>

    <p>I hope you have received the canvases I sent off about ten
    days ago in good order.</p>

    <p>I am going to make a long trip into the mountains to look
    for likely spots. Goodbye for now - above all, send the paint
    and the canvas if it hasn't already been sent off, for I have
    no more canvas at all, nor zinc white.</p>

    <p>Many kind regards to Jo.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
