  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Just a word to tell you - that partly as a result of your
    letter, in which you mention pen-and-ink drawings - I can send
    you 5 such drawings of weavers, which I drew after my painted
    studies, and which are a little different - and I think more
    vigorous of technique, than the pen drawings of mine you have
    seen up to now. I am working at them early and late, for except
    the painted studies, and the pen-and-ink drawings, I have also
    some new watercolours of them on the easel.</p>

    <p>My thoughts have been with you often recently, partly owing
    to a little book which you sent originally and which I borrowed
    from L. - Poems by Fran&ccedil;ois Coppe&eacute;. I knew only
    very few of them, but they had already greatly struck me at the
    time.</p>

    <p>He is one of the true artists - &ldquo;que y mettent leur
    peau&rdquo; - which is evident from more than one poignant
    confession. Artist the more because he finds his inspiration in
    so many very diverse things, and can paint a third-class
    waiting room full of emigrants who are spending the night there
    - everything grey and gloomy and melancholy - and in another
    mood he can draw a little marquise dancing a minuet, as elegant
    as a little figure by Watteau</p>

    <p>That losing oneself in the present - that being quite
    carried away and inspired by the surroundings in which one
    chances to be - how can one help it? And even if one should
    resist it at will, of what use would it be, why shouldn't one
    yield to what is directly before one, this being apr&egrave;s
    tout, the surest way to create something.</p>

    <p>I was struck by the last poem in the book, called:
    &ldquo;D&eacute;sir dans le spleen,&rdquo; which I copy to
    remind you of it:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Tout vit, tout aime, et moi, triste et seul, je me
    dresse<br>

    Ainsi qu'un arbre mort sur le ciel de printemps&hellip;<br>

    [All life, all love, and I, sad and alone, I am sanding<br>

    like a dead tree against the sky of spring&hellip;]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>and then this:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    DOULEUR BERC&Eacute;E<br>

    Toi que j'ai vu pareil au ch&ecirc;ne foudroy&eacute;<br>

    Je te retrouve &eacute;poux, je te retrouve
    p&egrave;re&hellip;<br>

    <p></p>

    [SORROW ASSUAGED<br>

    You, who I have seen like a lightning-struck oak,<br>

    I find you again, a husband, I find you again, a
    father&hellip;]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>And then this:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    BLESSURE ROUVERTE<br>

    O mon coeur, es tu donc si d&eacute;bile et si
    l&acirc;che,<br>

    Et serais tu pareil au for&ccedil;&acirc;t qu'on
    rel&acirc;che&hellip;<br>

    <p></p>

    [REOPENED WOUND<br>

    Oh my heart, are you then so feeble and so cowardly,<br>

    And would you be like a convict whom they
    release&hellip;]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>Sure this is poetry, and of the best.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;D&eacute;sir dans le spleen&rdquo; especially I think
    so true, it paints how, in those very souls that are exhausted
    and on the verge of dropping, there arises at moments that
    infinite renewal of desire, as if they had no past behind them.
    I thought of <art id=jbride>Rembrandt's &ldquo;Jewish Bride,&rdquo;</art> and what
    Thor&eacute; says of it. Thor&eacute; in his prime, and
    Th&eacute;ophile Gautier and so many others - how things have
    changed since then - and how much duller everything has become.
    If one wants to keep some of the sacred fire alive nowadays, in
    short, one must show it as little as possible to others.</p>

    <p>Did you receive the package I sent you last week? I must
    keep the pen-and-ink drawings here for another week, because I
    need them to finish other things which I started at the same
    time.</p>

    <p>However, you will receive them soon, but please let me know
    if the package arrived all right, and if it had enough
    stamps.</p>

    <p>Because drawings perhaps count as manuscripts, more may be
    due for them.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, I hope you will be able to find some use for
    them.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Father wrote you a few days ago about Mother; since then all
    is well, and today the doctor said that at first he had not
    dared to hope that all would go so favourably.</p>
