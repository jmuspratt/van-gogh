  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I write in great haste to tell you that I have had a note
    from Gauguin, saying that he has not written much, but that he
    is quite ready to come South as soon as the opportunity
    arises.</p>

    <p>They are enjoying themselves very much painting, arguing and
    fighting with the worthy Englishmen; he speaks well of
    Bernard's work, and B. speaks well of Gauguin's.</p>

    <p>I am hard at it, painting with the enthusiasm of a
    Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when
    you know that what I'm at is the painting of some big
    sunflowers.</p>

    <p>I have three canvases going - 1<sup>st</sup>, <art id=0453>three huge
    flowers in a green vase, with a light background, a size 15
    canvas</art>; 2<sup>nd</sup>, <art id=0459>three flowers, one
    gone to seed, having lost its petals, and one a bud against a
    royal-blue background, size 25 canvas</art>;
    3<sup>rd</sup>, <art id=0456>twelve flowers and buds in a yellow vase (size
    30 canvas)</art>. The last one is therefore light on
    light, and I hope it will be the best. Probably I shall not
    stop at that. Now that I hope to live with Gauguin in a studio
    of our own, I want to make decorations for the studio. Nothing
    but big flowers. Next door to your shop, in the restaurant, you
    know there is a lovely decoration of flowers; I always remember
    the big sunflowers in the window there.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">If I carry out this idea there will be a dozen panels. So
    the whole thing will be a symphony in blue and yellow. I am
    working at it every morning from sunrise on, for the flowers
    fade so soon, and the thing is to do the whole in one rush.</label></p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">You were quite right to tell Tasset that he must give us
    some tubes of colour for the 15 francs carriage not prepaid on
    the two packages. When I have finished these sunflowers, I may
    need yellow and blue perhaps. If so I will send a small order
    accordingly</label>. <label content="art.support">I very much like the ordinary canvas of Tasset's
    which was 50 centimes more expensive than Bourgeois's; it is
    very well prepared.</label></p>

    <p>I am very glad that G. is well.</p>

    <p>I am beginning to like the South more and more.</p>

    <p>I am working on another study of dusty thistles, with an
    innumerable swarm of white and yellow butterflies.[Painting lost]</p>

    <p>I have again missed some models which I had hoped to have
    these last few days. Koning has written saying that he is going
    to live in The Hague, and that he means to send you some
    studies.</p>

    <p>I have heaps of ideas for new canvases. I saw again today
    the same coal boat with the workmen unloading it that I told
    you about before, at the same place as the boats loaded with
    sand which I sent you <art id=1462>a drawing of</art>. It would be a splendid subject. Only I
    am beginning more and more to try <art id=0437>a simple technique</art> which is perhaps not
    impressionistic. I would like <art id=0438>to paint in such a way</art> that
    everybody, at least if they have eyes, would see it. I am
    writing in a hurry, but I wanted to enclose a few words to our
    sister.</p>

    <p>A handshake, I must get back to work.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Gauguin said that Bernard has made an album of my sketches
    and has shown it to him.</p>
