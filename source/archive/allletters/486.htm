  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have already written you once in Brussels, to tell you
    that I hoped you would be able to send me some more money at
    the latest on your return to Paris. You see, I have had to pay
    the whole bill provisionally, so as to get hold of my
    belongings, though I stipulated on the receipt that this
    exorbitant bill should be gone into before the magistrate.</p>

    <p>I am not sure of winning, though I have <i>undoubted</i>
    right to a 27 franc deduction, and even then I have no
    compensation for all the worry which this has caused me. First
    I had a period of absolutely absorbing work, then I was so
    exhausted and so ill that I did not feel strong enough to live
    alone, and I let things slide too much. <label content="health.general">They have calculated
    yesterday's bill from the time when I was paying them more
    because I was sick, and had asked them for better wine</label>. But in
    the end it will be for the best, because all this has driven me
    to take this decision. I consider that I am after all a
    workman, and not a coddled foreigner travelling for pleasure,
    and it would be feeble of me to let myself be exploited as
    such. So I am beginning to set up a studio which can likewise
    be used by the other fellows if one of them comes along or if
    there were painters here.</p>

    <p>The first thing you will find in the case are the pictures I
    did for<art id=0394> Jet Mauve</art> and <art id=0397>Tersteeg</art>. If meanwhile you have come to
    the conclusion that Tersteeg would be offended by it, if in
    short I had better have nothing to do with him, then keep it
    yourself and you can scrape off the dedication, and we can
    exchange it for something by one of the comrades.</p>

    <p>As for the copies of these two studies, I think that <art id=0571>the
    bridge</art> is better than Tersteeg's, but that the study for Jet
    Mauve is simpler than<art id=0404> the copy</art>.</p>

    <p>Perhaps this copy will improve in time. I have worked on it
    a lot.</p>

    <p>Next the series of orchards - I think that <art id=0403>the white orchard</art>
    of which I sent you<art id=1414> a pen drawing</art>, and <art id=0551>the biggest one in pink
    and green on absorbent canvas</art>, are the best.</p>

    <p>A big study without stretchers and another one on
    stretchers, in which there is a lot of stippling, are
    unfinished, which I regret, for the composition gave the
    general effect of the big orchards here surrounded by
    cypresses. I have already written you what I think of them and
    you will have them soon, since the case will be leaving this
    evening.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I think that as for frames, the two yellow bridges with the
    blue sky would do well in the dark blue they call royal blue,
    the white orchard in cold white, the big pink orchard in a
    rather warm creamy white.</p>
