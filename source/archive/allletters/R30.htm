  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter of February 27, which I'm answering
    today. First as to what you say about lithography. You will
    have seen that the very same paper is used for ink and for
    crayon. I got the paper from Jos. Smulders &amp; Co., paper
    dealers, Spuistraat, of this city; their storehouse is on the
    Laan, and they have a large stock of stones of various sizes
    there. They called it &ldquo;Korn&rdquo; paper, and they had
    bought it for one of the ministries, where they drew all kinds
    of maps on it for lithographic reproduction.</p>

    <p>There were a number of sheets left, and I took these, all of
    them. At the time he told me he would order some more sheets -
    did he do it? - I don't know - but Smulders knows all about it
    at any rate, and can have it sent to him by parcel post within
    a few days. It is rather expensive: 1.75 guilders per sheet.
    <label content="art.materials">The lithographic crayon - likewise made expressly for this
    paper - is more expensive than the ordinary kind, and in my
    opinion much worse than the crayon that is <i>not</i> expressly
    made for it. Autographic ink, liquid or in lumps [is certainly
    also sold by] Smulders and other dealers - for surely you can
    find these ingredients in all lithographers' shops.</label></p>

    <p>[<art id=320_V-R_R300>See the reproduction of the sketch of the tools.</art>]</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">The scraper I used has this form: I got it at Smulders's -
    [illegible] called a point - to scratch hair with, for
    instance, only for light fine scratches like those an etching
    needle makes, but which turn out white on the black
    surface.</p>

    <p>It goes without saying that you - [illegible] can use all
    kinds of implements as scrapers; the shape doesn't matter - now
    and then I scrape with my pocket-knife.</label></p>

    <p>What am I paying for my proofs? ? - he promised to state a
    fixed price, as well as the prices for printing and for the
    stones. The prices that I paid provisionally do not count; as
    the printer himself was not familiar with the method, we have
    compounded the matter - and also because there were failures,
    etc. I shall get estimates from Smulders, however, that will be
    rather important to know, but he will have to calculate them at
    his leisure. The fact is that he will give me the prices of the
    stones in various sizes, if taken by the dozen, and also the
    printing expenses for, say, a series of a dozen drawings and a
    series of two dozen - besides the price of the paper. When I
    saw him the last time he was in an awful rush and said,
    &ldquo;Come and discuss it again by the end of March; then
    we'll go to the warehouse and look everything over
    together.&rdquo; So for the time being I hardly know anything
    about the real prices.</p>

    <p>The ink's running when making transfers isn't caused
    directly by the thickness of the lines; I have seen enormously
    thick lines transferred quite clearly. As for your friend who
    draws with a little pen - well, that's his business - but
    personally I think it decidedly wrong, because I'm afraid that
    by doing this he is trying to get an effect from the process
    that's not in its character.</p>

    <p>If one wants to work with a fine point and yet remain
    vigorous, then I know only one method - <i>etching</i>.
    If one wants to work with the pen and autographic ink, then I
    am of the opinion that one should in no case take a finer pen
    than an ordinary writing pen. Very fine pens, like very elegant
    people, are sometimes amazingly useless; and, as I see it, they
    often lack elasticity which the most ordinary pens just
    naturally have to a certain extent.</p>

    <p>Last year I bought at least six special penholders and all
    kinds of nibs - and the whole lot was rubbish. But they
    <i>looked</i> very practical. Well - I'm none too sure myself -
    there may be good ones among them, and one may possibly get
    good results by working with finer pens and autographic ink -
    all right, so be it - I shall be delighted if it turns out
    well, but I should think one would not get the satisfaction one
    derives from the more fluent, bolder stroke of an ordinary
    quill pen, for instance.</p>

    <p>[See <art id=320_V-R_R301>the reproduction of this page of the letter</art>.]

    <p><label content="art.materials">Now something else. Do you know &ldquo;black mountain
    crayon&rdquo;? <sup>1</sup> Last year I got some big sticks
    about this size from my brother.</label></p>

    <p>I worked with it but without paying much attention to it; I
    found a piece of it the other day, however, and I was struck by
    its beautiful black colour.</p>

    <p>Well, yesterday I made a drawing with it - <art id=1020a>women and
    children at the serving window of the public soup kitchen</art>.
    And I can tell you I was delighted with this experiment.</p>

    <p>I've scratched a few strokes here at random in order to let
    you see the colour of the black. Don't you think it's a
    beautifully warm tone?</p>

    <p>I immediately wrote to my brother for more of it - shall I
    send you a piece when I get it? But if you know it already, and
    if you should be able to get it in your town, then please send
    me some. For I intend to go on using it in combination with
    lithographic crayon. It's just as if there's soul and life in
    that stuff, and as if it understood what you mean to express
    and co-operated. I should like to call it &ldquo;gypsy
    crayon.&rdquo; One need not use a holder, as the pieces are so
    long. It has the colour of a ploughed field on a summer
    evening! I would provide myself with a bushel, if it were sold
    by the bushel, which I doubt.</p>

    <p>The Album des Vosges is a relatively old publication, but it
    certainly does exist. And it is beautiful.</p>

    <p>Your list of wood engravings is very good, especially the
    Lan&ccedil;ons; I have the &ldquo;Contrebandiers&rdquo; too,
    but not the &ldquo;Comit&eacute; d'aide&rdquo; [Committee of
    Assistance], for instance. But I have found a duplicate of
    precisely the &ldquo;Soup Distribution&rdquo; - perhaps it is
    the same one, perhaps not - and I have a duplicate of
    &ldquo;Ragpickers in a Pub.&rdquo; So you can have these.</p>

    <p>I know little sketches by Renouard of cats, pigs and
    rabbits, but I haven't got any. I have &ldquo;Les Cours de
    Gambetta&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mendiants le jour de l'an&rdquo;
    [Beggars on New Year's Day] besides.</p>

    <p>I have found two beautiful R&eacute;gameys - a
    &ldquo;Foundlings' Hospital in Japan&rdquo; by F.
    R&eacute;gamey; and by Guillaume R&eacute;gamey, soldiers in
    white cloaks leading black horses by the bridle, after a
    painted sketch, very beautiful. I read a short biography of the
    two brothers. Guillaume lived only to the age of thirty-eight.
    Last fall he exhibited some military - [illegible] rather like
    Boulanger. After that he retired somewhat; he seems to have had
    an ailment that made life difficult for him. But he kept on
    working through it all - for many years. A multitude of superb
    studies came to light after he died - there has been an
    exhibition of them - hardly anybody knew of their existence
    during his lifetime. A fine thing, eh?</p>

    <p>F. R&eacute;gamey is traveling around a good deal, and as
    you know he is very strong on Japanese art. What you say about
    the French wood engravings in general rather coincides with my
    own opinion. The English especially have found the <i>soul</i>
    of the wood engravings - the original character that is just as
    peculiar as the character of etchings. Take Buckmann's &ldquo;A
    London Dustyard,&rdquo; for instance, and the &ldquo;Harbour of
    Refuge&rdquo; by Walker. Boetzel and Lavieille know how to do
    it too all the same, but Swain is the master. I think the
    Lan&ccedil;ons engraved by Moller, however, have a very
    original character too. There is a lot of good, for instance,
    in the Feyen-Perrins done by Boetzel and the Millets by
    Lavieille. But for the rest, yes, they often lapse into
    industrialism, into the unfeeling.</p>

    <p>You ask me about De Bock. I haven't been to see him for a
    long time, in fact, not since before I fell ill. I noticed that
    every time I came to him or met him in the street, he said,
    &ldquo;Oh, I'll come and see you one of these days,&rdquo; in
    such a way that I felt I had to conclude from it, Don't come to
    see me until I come to see you, which will never happen. Anyhow
    I haven't gone there again, because I certainly don't want to
    intrude. I know that De Bock is working on a large picture at
    the moment; this winter I saw some smaller ones which I thought
    very beautiful. I've met De Bock twice lately - not in his
    studio but in the street, in a fur coat, kid gloves, etc., in
    short like a man in very flourishing circumstances. I hear that
    he is doing what they call flourishing in general.</p>

    <p>I often think his work very fine - but it does not remind me
    primarily of Ruysdael, for instance - and I hardly think this
    will be your lasting, well-considered impression.</p>

    <p>In point of fact I should like greatly to go to his studio
    again, for the very reason that I should so like to be
    convinced that it is really <i>as</i> beautiful as I should
    like it to be, for now I cannot help having my doubts about him
    every now and then. My impression of him last year was really
    not very favourable - he was continually talking about Millet -
    very good! - and about the greatness and breadth of Millet - I
    talked with him about it once, for instance, in the country, in
    the Scheveningse Bosjes [Groves]. I said then, &ldquo;But, De
    Bock, if Millet were here at this moment, then would he look at
    those clouds and that grass and those twenty-seven tree trunks
    and forget that little fellow over there in his bombazine
    clothes, who is sitting there on the stump of a tree eating his
    poor-man's lunch, his spade lying at his side? Or do you think
    that little part of the scene, where the little fellow is
    sitting, would be the exact spot on which he would concentrate
    his attention? I don't believe I am less fond of Millet than
    you are,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;it pleases me enormously that
    you have a certain admiration for Millet - but, pardon me, I
    don't think Millet would look at the things you point out to me
    all the time. Millet is primarily, and more than any other, the
    painter of <i>humanity</i>. He has unquestionably
    painted landscapes, and they are beautiful - nothing is surer
    than that - but I find it hard to understand how you can really
    mean it when you say that you see in Millet <i>principally</i>
    those things you now point out to me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In short, Rappard, I find more of <i>Bilders</i>, for
    instance, than of Millet or Ruysdael in our friend De Bock. But
    I may be mistaken for all that, and see more in his work later
    on; nothing would please me more.</p>

    <p>I most certainly like Bilders too - and there is no picture
    of De Bock's that I don't look at with a certain pleasure -
    there is always something fresh and genial about it. But there
    is a certain kind of art - perhaps less flowery, more thorny -
    of which I find more in my own heart.</p>

    <p>I know, Ruysdael himself has had his metamorphoses, and
    perhaps his most beautiful works are not the waterfalls and the
    grand forest views but &ldquo;L'estacade aux eaux
    rousses&rdquo; and &ldquo;Le Buisson&rdquo; in the Louvre,
    &ldquo;The Mill at Wijk bij Duurstede&rdquo; in the Van der
    Hoop Collection, the &ldquo;Bleacheries at Overveen&rdquo; in
    the Mauritshuis [museum in The Hague] and other more
    commonplace things which he turned to in later years, probably
    under the influence of Rembrandt and Vermeer of Delft. I wish
    something similar would happen to De Bock, but will this be the
    case? I should be sorry for him if he did not land more in the
    thorns than in the flowerets - that's all.</p>

    <p>And although I have, unintentionally, been a little &agrave;
    froid with him of late, nothing more serious has occurred
    between him and me than a few discussions about Millet and
    similar topics. I have nothing against him, only I haven't
    exactly seen the style of Millet or Ruysdael in him up to now -
    I think his style for the present is something like Bilders's;
    I don't mean Gerard Bilders but the old one.</p>

    <p>I'm still quite delighted with the alterations in my studio,
    especially since the experiments I've made with various models
    have shown me how great an improvement it is. Formerly a
    figure in the studio cast no sharp shadow because the strong
    reflection threw light on it again, and so all effects were
    neutralized. This drawback has now been overcome.</p>

    <p>Don't think that I am going to neglect the lithographs, but
    I have had so many expenses, and I still have to buy so many
    necessaries, that I cannot attack new stones. Nothing will be
    lost by waiting a bit. I am very eager to work more with the
    &ldquo;black mountain crayon.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Do you know what I have a great longing for now and then? -
    for a look at your studio. And not only that, but also for a
    look at the places you are in the habit of walking in when
    hunting up subjects. No doubt there are beautiful little courts
    and alleys in Utrecht too.</p>

    <p>The Hague is beautiful - and there is an enormous variety of
    scenes. I hope to work hard this year. There are also often
    financial difficulties that hamper me, which you will
    understand, and this is the very reason why - because I want to
    work much and must in fact do so - I shall concentrate more and
    more on black and white.</p>

    <p>When I'm doing watercolours or oil paintings I must stop
    every now and then on account of the expense, but with a piece
    of crayon or lead pencil one has only the expense of the model
    and some paper. And I prefer to spend the little I have on
    models, I assure you, than to spend it on painting materials. I
    have never regretted the money I spend on models.</p>

    <p>Do you have the portrait of Carlyle - that beautiful one in
    the Graphic? At the moment I am reading his Sartor Resartus -
    &ldquo;the philosophy of old clothes.&rdquo; Among the
    &ldquo;old clothes&rdquo; he includes all kinds of forms and in
    the matter of religion all dogmas; it is beautiful - and
    faithful to reality - and humane. There has been a lot of
    grumbling about this book, as about his other books. Many
    consider Carlyle a monster - a joke about his &ldquo;philosophy
    of old clothes&rdquo; runs like this: Carlyle not only strips
    mankind to the skin, he even flays it. Something like that.
    Well, this is not true, but it most certainly is true that be
    is honest enough not to call the shirt the skin - and very far
    from seeing a tendency to belittle man in his works, I find, on
    the contrary, that he raises man to a high position in the
    universe. And much more than bitter criticism I find in him a
    love of humanity besides - a great love. He - Carlyle - has
    learned much from Goethe - but still more, I believe, from a
    certain man who did not write books, but whose words, though he
    did not write them down himself, have endured - namely Jesus...
    who, long before Carlyle, included many forms of all kinds of
    things among the &ldquo;old clothes&rdquo; too.</p>

    <p>I bought a new sixpenny edition of Dickens's Christmas Carol
    and The Haunted Man (London, Chapman &amp; Hall) this week, in
    which there are some seven illustrations, e.g., among
    other things, a &ldquo;Secondhand Shop&rdquo; by Barnard. I
    admire everything that Dickens wrote, but I have reread these
    two &ldquo;children's tales&rdquo; nearly every year since I
    was a boy, and they are new to me again every time. Barnard
    understood Dickens well. The other day I saw photographs again
    of some black-and-white drawings by Barnard, a series of
    characters from Dickens's books; I saw Mrs. Camp, Little
    Dorrit, Sikes, Sydney Carton and some others. They are highly
    accentuated figures - most important, treated as cartoons.</p>

    <p>There is no writer, in my opinion, who is <i>so</i> much a
    painter and a black-and-white artist as Dickens. His figures
    are resurrections. On a nursery print I found a little wood
    engraving after Barnard by Swain - a black policeman is
    dragging along a woman in white who is struggling backward, and
    a crowd of street urchins is following them. It is hardly
    possible to express <i>so</i> much of the true character of a
    poor neighborhood with fewer means. I shall try to get another
    copy of this print for you; as a matter of fact it's only a
    small sketch.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately I have <i>not</i> been able to get that sheet
    of <art id=mptychair>Fildes's &ldquo;Empty Chair&rdquo;</art> for you, which was
    promised me together with some others. Now the man remembers
    getting rid of them some years ago.</p>

    <p>Write soon again - I wish you good luck with your work in
    every respect. By the way, I have a nearly complete French
    edition of Dickens, translated under the supervision of Dickens
    himself. I think you told me once that you could not enjoy all
    the English books by Dickens because of the sometimes
    complicated English, as for instance the miners' [sic] dialect
    in Hard Times<i>.</i> If you should ever want to read something
    of this French edition, it is at your disposal, and I am even
    willing to exchange the whole collection of Dickens's works in
    French for something else, if you should care to. I am thinking
    of gradually getting the English Household Edition.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>There is character too in the illustrations by John Leech
    and Cruikshank - but the Barnards are more intensively worked
    out. Nevertheless, Leech is strong on street urchins.</p>

    <p>In the Graphic for February 10, 1883, there is a little
    figure by Frank Hol - a child in a little attic, very full of
    character; I bought the number especially for that.</p>

      <li value="1">
        <p>This is a literal translation of the Dutch
        <i>bergkrijt,</i> but it is not clear what kind of crayon
        Vincent meant - most probably a very soft kind which
        produced bold, deep black strokes.</p>
