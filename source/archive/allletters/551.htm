  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have done another size 30 canvas,<art id=0472> &ldquo;An Autumn
    Garden,&rdquo; with two cypresses, bottle green, shaped like
    bottles, and three little chestnut trees with tobacco and
    orange-coloured leaves. And a little yew tree with pale citron
    foliage and a violet trunk, and two little bushes, blood-red
    and scarlet purple leaves.</art></p>

    <p>And some sand, some grass, and some blue sky.</p>

    <p>And yet I had sworn to myself that I would not work. But it
    is like that every day, just accidentally I sometimes come upon
    things so lovely that I have to try to do them after all.</p>

    <p>Well, the money which you are giving me, and which I keep on
    asking for more than ever, I will pay back to you in work, and
    not only for the present but for <i>the past as well</i>. But
    let me work as long as it is not absolutely impossible.</p>

    <p>For it would be so much worse if I did not take advantage of
    the opportunities.<label content="business.co-op"> Oh my dear boy, if only I could do
    something, or if Gauguin and I between us could do such things
    that Seurat would join hands with us. But in my opinion we must
    put his big pictures of the &ldquo;Models&rdquo; and the
    &ldquo;Grande Jatte&rdquo; down, well - let me see - say at
    5000 apiece at the lowest.</p>

    <p>Well, if we combined, Gauguin and I also ought to be good
    for a nominal capital of 10,000 each.</label></p>

    <p>Once more that squares exactly with what I was telling you,
    that I was determined to do 10,000 francs' worth of paintings
    for the house. It is odd that though I do not calculate with
    figures but with what I feel, I so often come to the same
    results, after starting from absolutely divergent points of
    view. I do not dare to think, I do not dare to say anything
    more of this Seurat combination. First I must try to get to
    know Gauguin better. When we have him, we can't lose
    anyhow.</p>

    <p>Listen to me again. As soon as you can, at once even if it's
    possible, I need 10 more meters of canvas at 2.50 fr.</p>

    <p>Then big tubes like the flake white and the zinc white.</p>

    <p>Zinc white 20 of the biggest tubes</p>

    <p>Flake white 10 &ldquo; &ldquo;</p>

    <p>Chrome yellow 1. 10 &ldquo; &ldquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo; &ldquo;2. 5 &ldquo; &ldquo;</p>

    <p>Prussian blue 5 &ldquo; &ldquo;</p>

    <p>Geranium lake 10 medium tubes</p>

    <p>Malachite green 10 of the biggest tubes</p>

    <p>But I must say that I should be absolutely astonished if we
    could not first overcome the existing difficulties of
    production, <i>no matter what</i>.</p>

    <p>If there's a hitch, we shall have to take counsel as soon as
    Gauguin comes, which I am hoping for from one day to the
    next.</p>

    <p>I think that it may make a nice stir at the exhibition in
    '89. It might be more convenient if it didn't make a hit, but
    anyway we must really take things as they come. By the way,
    have you ever read Les Fr&egrave;res Zemganno, by the de
    Goncourt brothers? If not, read it. I might be more daring
    perhaps if I had not read it, and even after reading it my only
    fear is of asking you for too much money. If I come to grief
    myself in the attempt, it would do me no harm. In that case I
    have still some resource, for I should either go into business
    or I should write. But as long as I am painting, I see nothing
    for it but the association of several fellows and a life in
    common.</p>

    <p>The leaves have begun to fall, you can see the trees turning
    yellow, and the yellow increasing every day. It is at least as
    beautiful as the orchards in bloom, and as for the work we are
    doing, I venture to think that far from losing on it, we shall
    make a profit. So much for that.</p>

    <p>In any case please send by return mail, and certainly not
    later, some more money (50 if possible), or else less. And if
    you haven't time to write, please send it by money order,
    either more or less, depending on what you can spare.</p>

    <p>A good handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
