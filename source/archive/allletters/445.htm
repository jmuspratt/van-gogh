  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I want to tell you that Verlat has at last seen my work, and
    when he saw the two landscapes and the still life that I had
    brought from the country, he said, &ldquo;Yes, but that does
    not concern me&rdquo;; when I showed him the two portraits he
    said, &ldquo;That is different, if it is figure painting, you
    may come.&rdquo; So tomorrow I shall start working in the
    academy's painting class.</p>

    <p>Besides, I have arranged with Vinck (a pupil of Leys's by
    whom I saw things in the manner of Leys, medieval) to draw
    works of antiquity in the evening.</p>

    <p>I think neither of these things will do me harm, and perhaps
    can be of some use to me either in painting or in drawing. And
    at all events, it is an attempt to come into contact with
    people. In the painting and drawing class I saw in passing
    several fellows my age at work.</p>

    <p>And if I might get on friendly terms with Verlat or Vinck or
    whoever it may be, it would certainly get me a lot of
    models.</p>

    <p>Well, this is essentially the practical side of the
    matter.</p>

    <p>Then I have to go and see two fellows about portraits; I do
    not know what the result will be.</p>

    <p>One is a question of two portraits of a couple of very
    beautiful hussies, types with dark eyes, dark hair, two
    sisters, who I suppose are kept women.</p>

    <p>And the other one is a portrait of a married woman. But I
    repeat, there is nothing definite, and it may come to
    nothing.</p>

    <p>But I know that eventually I would be willing to do them for
    nothing, just for practice.</p>

    <p>But just consider whether, if I must go and work there or
    anywhere else, it is necessary for me to do something about my
    clothes, for I have worn mine for two years now, and especially
    of late they have had much wear and tear. Even a suit for some
    40 fr. would do.</p>

    <p>And I must also be prepared for Verlat's saying I have to
    provide myself with some painting material or other, so that I
    must have the means to do so. Therefore try, as I asked you, to
    send me another 50 fr., then I can keep going till the end of
    the month, and could buy a new pair of trousers and a waistcoat
    at once, and the coat in February.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">It is very cold here, and most of the time I feel far from
    well, but as long as the painting flourishes, it doesn't matter
    so much.</label></p>

    <p>I have been drawing there for two evenings already, and I
    must say that I believe that just for the making of, for
    instance, peasant figures, it is very useful to draw from the
    plaster casts. But for goodness' sake, not the way it is
    usually done. In fact, in my opinion the drawings that I see
    there are all hopelessly bad and absolutely wrong, and I know
    for sure that mine are totally different. Time must show who is
    right.</p>

    <p>The feeling of what ancient sculpture is, damn it, <i>not
    one of them has it</i>.</p>

    <p>I, who for years had not seen any good plaster casts of
    ancient sculptures - and those they have here are very good -
    and who during all those years have always had the living model
    before me, on looking at them carefully again, I am amazed at
    the ancients' wonderful knowledge and the correctness of their
    sentiment.</p>

    <p>Well, probably the academic gentlemen will accuse me of
    heresy, but never mind.</p>

    <p>I should like to get on with Verlat. I think many of the
    things he makes both harsh and wrong in colour and
    <i>paint</i>, but <i>I know that he also has his good days</i>,
    for instance, that he paints a better portrait than most of the
    others. So we must wait and see.</p>

    <p>I feel in high spirits notwithstanding all, just because it
    refreshes me to be in all kinds of conditions so disparate from
    those in the country, and it may be that I shall feel at home
    here after all - but do your best to write me soon, and it is
    really necessary that I get those 50 fr. for this month,
    otherwise I cannot manage, and things are too urgent.
    Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
