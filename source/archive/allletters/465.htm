  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Will you read the letter I have written to Mr. Tersteeg, and
    will you send it to him with a letter of your own if you think
    it is a good move?<label content="business.selling"> You see, my idea was that we must try
    something in this direction, because we shall have a hold over
    Reid through v. Wisselingh, and over v. Wisselingh through
    Tersteeg. And this you will explain to Tersteeg yourself. Since
    I am dependent on you, and you yourself get your own income
    from the Boussod Valadon people, I do not want to do anything
    against that firm. On the contrary, I ask nothing better than
    that the business you began in the shop on the boulevard should
    go on and increase in importance.</label></p>

    <p>But you need the support of other employees of the firm. If
    Tersteeg refuses to have anything to do with it, we still have
    Reid and Wisselingh as English agents. You know that v.
    W. married a daughter of a picture dealer in Glasgow, a
    business rival of Reid's. <i>If</i> Reid takes up the
    impressionists, if he finds a jumping-off ground there, and if
    he tries to do this in opposition to <i>us</i>, from that
    moment we have the right to put his rival up to it. But if
    Wisselingh ever takes it up, and above all if now or later you
    have a chat with Wisselingh about it, then Tersteeg could at
    once reproach you - &ldquo;And why, sir, when you took up the
    impressionists, did you keep the firm that employs you in the
    dark?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So you must speak to Tersteeg about it at once, and to save
    you the trouble of writing a long letter, this time I have done
    it myself. You can make it all complete by adding a vague
    remark about Reid and the impressionists, and the interest that
    Wisselingh may come to have in the final outcome of this
    affair.</p>

    <p>And I have said in the postscript that in view of the low
    prices compared with the interest the pictures offer, Tersteeg
    could easily dispose of fifty or so for us in Holland; besides,
    he will be obliged to have some of them, because if they are
    already being talked about in Antwerp and Brussels, they will
    likewise be talked about in Amsterdam and The Hague before
    long.</p>

    <p>Finally, what I propose in the letter should not be very
    disagreeable either to Tersteeg or yourself; you will pilot him
    round the studios, and he will see for himself that next year
    people will start talking, and will go on talking about the new
    school long enough. If, however, you think my letter ill timed,
    you have my full permission to burn it. Only if you send it,
    suggest the same thing to him yourself.</p>

    <p>You know very well, however, that Tersteeg is as much at
    home in the English business as a fish out of water, so that it
    is perfectly possible that he might be the person to direct the
    sale of these new pictures over there. As a matter of fact, in
    this way Tersteeg and the London agent would have a permanent
    exhibition of the impressionists in London, you in Paris, and I
    should begin in Marseilles; but Tersteeg must see plenty of
    them for himself first, and that is why it is desirable that
    you should take him on a grand tour of the studios, and explain
    to him the whole importance of the business as you go.</p>

    <p>The association of the artists will come about all the more
    easily since Tersteeg will have no objection to our having the
    artist's interests at heart, especially not to our wanting to
    raise the net price of the picture; after all, there would be
    no market for it if it cost nothing.</p>

    <p>In any case we must speak out boldly now, don't you think?
    And Mesdag and the rest must give up <i>ridiculing</i> the
    impressionists. In any case it will be a good thing to have
    Tersteeg interviewed on the subject.</p>

    <p>You see, in my opinion the whole crux of the matter in
    England is this: either the artists give their work away at a
    wretched price to the dealers there, or else they combine, and
    choose for themselves intelligent agents who won't fleece them.
    Now think it over and send the letter or burn it as you think
    best. I am not absolutely set on its being sent, but should
    very much like to see Tersteeg in this, because he has the
    necessary assurance.</p>

    <p>With a good handshake, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin] I have done another study.</p>
