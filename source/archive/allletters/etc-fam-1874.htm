    <p>Anna van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>24<sup>th</sup> February 1874</p>

    <p>I also got a very kind letter from Eug&eacute;nie; she
    seems to be a natural and amiable girl. Vincent wrote that she
    was engaged, with a good natured youth who would know to
    appreciate her&hellip;We two are just [like] old people who try
    to know all about persons who are in love. But I am very glad
    for Vincent that he found such a kind family to live [with],
    you know yourself how agreeable it is. He seems to be always in
    good spirits. In the last letter he writes to me: &ldquo;I fear
    that after all the sunshine I enjoy from there could be very
    soon rain - but I will only enjoy as long as possible the
    sunshine and have my umbrella in the neighbourhood for the rain
    that could come.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>15 August 1874</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>[&hellip;] They [Vincent and Anna] have moved and live no
    more en famille, but have rented rooms. Their address is Ivy
    Cottage, 395 Kennington New Road, London. At the Loyers it
    appeared not to be too satisfactory. I am glad; I did not trust
    it any too well.</p>

    <p>[&hellip;] Yesterday afternoon there was a letter from
    Vincent and Anna [&hellip;] Anna found a job at a school (day
    school) in a small but very nice village some five hours from
    London. Salary twelve pounds a year, so that is not much yet;
    [&hellip;] She is free at four in the afternoon, and lives with
    the lady, a little, shy person, she writes. [&hellip;]</p>

    <p>[Added by Mother]</p>

    <p>How strange it will be for them when they part company. On
    the 24<sup>th</sup> of August Anna must start her job; may she
    have the courage and strength to go on with it.</p>

    <p>28 October 1874</p>

    <p>Mrs.van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>[&hellip;] <label subject="health.mental">Don't you think it very sad that Vincent does not write to us, during such important days? Oh, Theo, you don't
    know how it distresses us and how we long to go to him and say,
    &ldquo;Boy, how is it? Isn't it true we can't live without each
    other and love each other too dearly to be estranged from each
    other and not open our hearts?&rdquo;</label><label content="fear.paranoia"> He thought that Father
    had brought about his transfer, which in itself he was pleased
    with, he wrote in his last unfriendly note. We later heard from
    Anna that he had sent her a postcard asking for his suitcase.
    She was also longing to hear something from him. After that
    letter from Vincent, Father assured him immediately that he had
    not spoken about Paris with Uncle, but Uncle with him. Uncle
    had said he wished the transfer for Vincent's sake; he wanted
    to give him a better insight into the business, especially in
    connection with the later enlargement of the London branch.</label></p>

    <p>Theo, do not stop going to church; very often you will hear
    words there about the things you have been thinking about,
    words that you need to bear happily the difficulties you meet
    or to be consoled in your sorrows. There is so much in life,
    and you will often come back from church with satisfaction and
    admit that, even if you don't think it <i>necessary</i>, it is
    useful to be reminded of those things in a world that is so
    full of distractions and worries.</p>
