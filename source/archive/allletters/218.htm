  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>It is already late, but I felt like writing to you again
    anyway. You are not here - but I need you and sometimes feel
    that we are not far away from each other.</p>

    <p><label content="health.venereal">Today I promised myself something, that is, to treat my
    illness, or rather what remains of it, as if it didn't exist.</label>
    Enough time has been lost, work must go on. So, well or not
    well, I am going back to drawing regularly from morning until
    night. I don't want anybody to be able to say to me again,
    &ldquo;Oh! but those are only old drawings.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I drew a study today of <art id=1024>the baby's little cradle with a few
    touches of colour in it.</art> I am also at work on one like one of
    those meadows I sent you recently.</p>

    <p>My hands have become a little too white for my liking, but
    that's too bad. I'm going to go back outdoors again, a possible
    relapse matters less to me than staying away from work any
    longer.</p>

    <p>Art is jealous, she does not like taking second place to an
    illness. Hence I shall humour her. So you will, I hope, be
    receiving a few more reasonably acceptable things shortly.</p>

    <p>People like me really <i>should</i> not be ill. I would like
    to make it perfectly clear to you how I look at art. To get to
    the essence of things one must work long and hard.</p>

    <p>What I want and have as my aim is infernally difficult to
    achieve, and yet I don't think I am raising my sights too high.
    I want to make drawings that <i>touch</i> some people.</p>

    <p><art id=929a>&ldquo;Sorrow&rdquo;</art> is a small beginning - perhaps such
    little landscapes as the &ldquo;Meerdervoort Avenue,&rdquo;
    the &ldquo;Rijswijk Meadows,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Fish-Drying
    Barn,&rdquo; are also a small beginning. There is at least
    something straight from my own heart in them. What I want to
    express, in both figure and landscape, isn't anything
    sentimental or melancholy, but deep anguish. In short, I want
    to get to the point where people say of my work: that man feels
    deeply, that man feels keenly. In spite of my so-called
    coarseness - do you understand? - perhaps even because of it.
    It seems pretentious to speak this way now, but that is the
    reason why I want to put all my energies into it.</p>

    <p>What am I in the eyes of most people - a nonentity, an
    eccentric or an unpleasant person - somebody who has no
    position in society and never will have, in short, the lowest
    of the low.</p>

    <p>All right, then - even if that were absolutely true, then I
    should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric,
    such a nobody, has in his heart.</p>

    <p>That is my ambition, based less on resentment than on love
    malgr&eacute; tout [in spite of everything], based more on a
    feeling of serenity than on passion.</p>

    <p>Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still
    calmness, pure harmony and music inside me. I see paintings or
    drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest comers. And
    my mind is driven towards these things with an irresistible
    momentum.</p>

    <p>Other things increasingly lose their hold on me, and the
    more they do so the more quickly my eye lights on the
    picturesque. Art demands dogged work, work in spite of
    everything and continuous observation. By dogged, I mean in the
    first place incessant labour, but also not abandoning one's
    views upon the say-so of this person or that.</p>

    <p>I am not without hope, brother, that within a few year's
    time, or perhaps even now, little by little you will be seeing
    things I have done that will give you some satisfaction after
    all your sacrifices.</p>

    <p>I have had very little contact with other painters lately. I
    haven't been the worse for it. It isn't the language of
    painters so much as the language of nature that one should
    heed. I can understand better now than I could six months ago
    why Mauve said: don't talk to me about Dupr&eacute;, I'd rather
    you talked about the bank of that ditch, or something of that
    sort. That may sound a bit strong, and yet it is absolutely
    right. The feeling for things themselves, for reality, is of
    greater importance than the feeling for painting; anyway it is
    more productive and more inspiring.</p>

    <p>Because I now have such a broad, such an expansive feeling
    for art and for life itself, of which art is the essence, it
    sounds so shrill and false when people like Tersteeg do nothing
    but harry one.</p>

    <p>For my own part, I find that many modern pictures have a
    peculiar charm which the old ones lack. To me, one of the
    highest and noblest expressions of art will always be that of
    the English, for instance Millais and Herkomer and Frank Holl.
    What I would say with respect to the difference between old and
    present-day art is - perhaps the modern artists are deeper
    thinkers.</p>

    <p>There is a great difference in sentiment between, for
    instance, Chill October by Millais and Bleaching Ground at
    Overveen by Ruysdael. And equally between Irish Emigrants by
    Holl and the women reading from the Bible by Rembrandt.
    Rembrandt and Ruysdael are sublime, for us as well as for their
    contemporaries, but there is something in the moderns that
    seems to us more personal and intimate.</p>

    <p>It is the same with Swain's woodcuts and those of the old
    German masters.</p>

    <p>And so it was a mistake when the modem painters thought it
    all the rage to imitate the old ones a few years ago. That's
    why I think old Millet is right to say, `Il me semble absurde
    que les hommes veuillent para&icirc;tre autre chose que ce
    qu'ils sont. [It seems absurd to me that people want to seem
    other than they are.] That may seem trite, and yet it is as
    unfathomably deep as the ocean, and personally I am all for
    taking it to heart.</p>

    <p>I just wanted to tell you that I am going to get back to
    working regularly again, and must do so quand m&ecirc;me [at
    that] - and I'd just like to add that I look forward so much
    for a letter - and for the rest, I bid you goodnight. Goodbye,
    with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">Please remember the <i>thick</i> Ingres if you can, enclosed
    is another sample. I still have a supply of the thin kind. I
    can do watercolour washes on the <i>thick Ingres,</i> but on
    the sans fin, for instance, it always goes blurry, by no fault
    of mine.</label></p>

    <p>I hope that by <i>keeping hard at it</i> I shall draw the
    little cradle another hundred times, besides what I did
    today.</p>
