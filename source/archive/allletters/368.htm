  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have waited too long to answer your last letter, and I
    will tell you why. Let me begin by thanking you for your letter
    and the 200 francs enclosed. And then I want to tell you that
    today I just finished arranging a spacious new studio I have
    rented.</p>

    <p>Two rooms - a big one and a smaller one adjoining.</p>

    <p>That kept me pretty busy these last two weeks. I think I
    shall be able to work much better there than in the little room
    at home. And I hope you will approve of the step I have taken
    when you see it.</p>

    <p>For the rest, I have been very busy painting <art id=030>the large study
    of the weaver I told you of</art>, and I have also
    started to paint <art id=040>the little church steeple, you know</art>.</p>

    <p>What you write about the Salon is very important. As to what
    you say about Puvis de Chavannes, I am very glad to see his
    work thus, and I perfectly agree with your appreciation of his
    talent. As to the colourists, after all I think the same as you
    do about them. I can become quite absorbed in a Puvis de
    Chavannes, but for all that I should feel exactly the same as
    you do in front of a landscape with cows by Mauve, and
    paintings by Maris and Isra&euml;ls.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">As to my own palette, you will <i>not</i> find the silvery
    tones in my work done here, but rather brown ones (bitumen for
    instance and bistre), which I do not doubt some people will
    disapprove of.</label></p>

    <p>But you will see for yourself when you come here.</p>

    <p>I have been so busy painting that lately I haven't made a
    single drawing. Van Rappard writes me that he will come by the
    end of this week; I am very glad.</p>

    <p>Moreover I think he will come back this year for a longer
    time.</p>

    <p>He is bringing a number of my drawings with him, which I
    will then send on to you at once.</p>

    <p><i>After some time</i>, perhaps I shall agree with you that
    last year's change has improved my position, and that it has
    been a change for the better.</p>

    <p>But I shall always regret that at the time I had to give up
    a thing which I should have liked to carry through.</p>

    <p>I think that Mother is getting on very well; yesterday she
    came in her Bath chair to see my new studio.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.people">Recently I have been getting on better with people here than
    I did at first, which is of great importance to me, for one
    decidedly needs some distraction, and if one feels too lonely,
    the work always suffers from it; however, perhaps one must be
    prepared for it not to last.</label></p>

    <p>But I feel quite optimistic about it, it seems to me that in
    general the people in Nuenen are better than those in Etten or
    Helvoirt; there is more sincerity here, at least that is my
    impression after having been here for some time.</p>

    <p>It is true the people here look at things from a clergyman's
    point of view, but in such a way that I, for my part, don't
    feel any scruple in putting up with it.</p>

    <p><i>And the Brabant of one's dreams</i>, reality almost comes
    very near it sometimes.</p>

    <p>I admit that my original intention of settling in Brabant,
    which came to naught, again has a strong attraction for me. But
    knowing how such a plan can fail, we must wait and see whether
    it would prove an illusion or not; well, for the present I have
    enough to do. I again have space enough to be able to work with
    a model, but there's absolutely no saying how long it will
    last.</p>

    <p>Well, goodbye, the Salon will certainly give you a lot of
    work, but for all that, it will be an interesting time too.</p>

    <p>Once more, thanks for what you sent, which indeed I really
    needed because of this change. I hope you will approve of it
    when you see how I have arranged things. Goodbye, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Love from all at home, they ask you to write to them.</p>
