    <p>Hoogeveen, Tuesday evening</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just arrived here.</p>

    <p>From the train I saw some beautiful bits of the Veluwe, but
    everything was dark by the time we arrived in these parts. So I
    do not know much about it yet. I am sitting in a large
    inn-parlour, like those in Brabant, where a woman is sitting
    peeling potatoes, rather a pretty little figure.</p>

    <p>I have been talking to the people here, and one of these
    days I shall go by barge down the whole Hoogeveen canal,
    through the peat fields, straight across the southeastern
    corner of Drenthe.</p>

    <p>From here to the north there seems to be a beautiful heath
    right up to Assen. You can imagine I am rather curious to see
    it all.</p>

    <p>Everything came off well at The Hague. That land surveyor [Furn&eacute;e]
    came to say goodbye at the station.</p>

    <p>Of course the woman and her children were with me to the
    last, and when I left, the parting was not very easy.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.guilt">I have provided her with all kinds of things as well as I
    could, but she will have a hard time.</label></p>

    <p>I have taken only a very few colours with me, but
    nevertheless some, and I hope to begin the attack soon. The
    colour of the Veluwe was rich.</p>

    <p>I shall wait here for your next letter. I am staying at a
    village inn quite near the station.</p>

    <p>The address is: A. Hartsuiker, Innkeeper, Hoogeveen.</p>

    <p>Later I may go farther into the heart of the country, but I
    must wait till I have some stock of colours.</p>

    <p>I shall write more soon; for the moment I've seen nothing
    but what I tell you, the scene through the carriage window and
    the barroom here, which is nothing special.</p>

    <p>I only want to tell you I am here.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, tomorrow I am going out investigating. A
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>When you receive this, be so kind as to mail a postcard at
    once to see whether it reaches me all right. I got up very
    early this morning because I was rather curious. The weather is
    splendid, the air is clear and bracing, as in Brabant. Here at
    the inn I saw a stable fitted up differently from those in
    Brabant. Perhaps I shall make something of it someday, at least
    if I stay here.</p>

    <p>Well, the country around here is for the greater part
    meadowland, with little trees here and there. I think I did well
    to choose Hoogeveen as my starting point. At least it is rather
    curious that I already heard, on the very first evening, how I
    can travel through the whole peat district, as far as the
    Prussian frontier and the Black Lake on the barges. I shall
    soon write you more about it than I can today. As soon as I
    have more colours, I shall begin that excursion and will go
    from one village to another.</p>

    <p>But my address will still be here, and I shall leave my
    things here even if I am absent for some time and do not know
    exactly where I shall be.</p>

    <p>I have arranged to pay a guilder a day while I'm here, and I
    can leave my trunk, etc., in the garret while I'm away. In the
    village harbour I saw very quaint peat barges, and figures of
    bargemen's wives dressed as they are here in the hayfield -
    very picturesque.</p>

    <p>Further into the country it will be even more beautiful; but
    for the present I see very good things even here.</p>

    <p>So drop me a line soon at the address: A. Hartsuiker,
    Innkeeper at Hoogeveen.</p>

    <p>The village, or little town, is just a long row of houses
    along the harbour, many new houses and a few more beautiful old
    ones.</p>
