  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>I received your letter with enclosed 100 fr., and thank you
    most kindly for it. I want to write you at once because I think
    it is well to explain a few things to you and in all
    seriousness, because it is important that you <i>know</i> and
    <i>understand</i> them well. So I hope you will read this
    letter patiently and at your ease, for so much depends on it
    for me. Tomorrow morning I am going back to the hospital, and I
    shall be able to lay my head down peacefully if I know that you
    are informed about everything as explicitly and clearly as the
    distance allows. I wish you were here so much more; then I
    could show you everything and talk things over with you. But
    let us hope it will happen in August.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">Before beginning to write about various other things, I want
    to tell you that the part of your letter describing Paris by
    night touched me very much. Because it brought back to me the
    memory of when I too saw &ldquo;Paris tout gris,&rdquo;</label> and was
    struck by that very peculiar effect with the black figure and
    characteristic white horse which gave the full value to the
    delicacy of that unusual grey. That little dark note and that
    toneful white are the key to the harmony. But by chance, while
    I was in the hospital, I was greatly impressed by an artist who
    describes this &ldquo;Paris tout gris&rdquo; with a master
    hand. In Une Page d'Amour by Emile Zola I found some views of
    the city so superbly painted or drawn, quite in the same mood
    as the simple passage in your letter. And that little book
    prompts me to read everything by Zola; up to now I knew only a
    few short fragments of his works, for which I tried to make an
    illustration - Ce que je veux and another fragment which
    describes a little old peasant, exactly like a drawing by
    Millet.</p>

    <p>There is something confoundedly artistic in you, brother;
    cultivate it, first let it take root, and then let it branch
    out. Don't give it to everybody, but keep it seriously for
    yourself; think it over, and don't consider it a misfortune if,
    through this thinking, it concentrates itself and takes a more
    or less important place in your activity. But perhaps I am
    venturing on forbidden ground, so no more about it for
    today.</p>

    <p>One more thing, there is &ldquo;colour&rdquo; in your short
    description which is palpable and visible to me, though you did
    not carry your impression through till it assumed a more robust
    form, and stood visible and palpable to everybody. The real
    throes and anguish of creating begin at the point where you
    drop the description; but you possess a damn good creative
    intelligence. Right now you can go no further because you don't
    believe in yourself in this respect; otherwise you would jump
    the ditch, that is to say, you would venture further. But
    enough of this; there is a je ne sais quoi in your description,
    a fragrance, a memory, for instance, of a watercolour by
    Bonington - only it is still vague, as if in a haze. Do you
    know that drawing with <i>words</i> is also an art, which
    sometimes betrays a slumbering hidden force, like small blue or
    grey puffs of smoke indicate a fire on the hearth?</p>

    <p>I certainly appreciate what Father and Mother did during my
    illness - you know that I wrote you about it at once -
    likewise, I appreciated Tersteeg's visit. However, I did not
    write at once to Father and Mother about Sien or the like, but
    only kept them informed of my recovery with a few words. And
    this is why: something of what happened last summer and last
    winter seemed to put an iron barrier between the past and the
    present.</p>

    <p>I did not intend to ask Father and Mother for their advice
    and opinions <i>in the same way</i> as I did last year, because
    it was then proved to me that there is a decided difference in
    our thoughts and views on life. However, it is my greatest
    longing to keep peace, and to convince Father and Mother that
    they would do well not to oppose me, thinking me a person who
    is always dreaming and incapable of action - and that they
    would be mistaken if they thought I regarded things so
    impractically that it would be necessary for them to
    &ldquo;guide&rdquo; me.</p>

    <p>Look here, Theo, believe me I do not say this in bitterness,
    despising or depreciating Father and Mother - or in self-praise
    - but only to prove to you this fact: Father and Mother are not
    the people who understand me - neither in my faults nor in my
    good qualities - they cannot realize my feelings - it's no use
    arguing with them. What is to be done now??? This is my plan,
    which I hope you will approve of. I hope to be able to manage
    so that I can save 10 or 15 guilders next month. Then - but not
    before - I shall write Father and Mother that I have something
    to tell them. I shall beg Father to make another trip here at
    my expense, and to come and stay with me for a few days. Then I
    shall show him Sien and her little baby, which he will not
    expect - and the neat house and studio full of the things I am
    working on - and I myself quite recovered by then, I hope.</p>

    <p>I think all this will make a better and deeper and more
    favourable impression on Father than words or letters. In a few
    short words I will tell him how Sien and I struggled through
    the hard time of her pregnancy this winter - how faithfully you
    helped us, though you only heard about Sien afterward; that she
    is invaluable to me, first, by the love and affection which
    circumstances created between us, and second, because from the
    beginning she has devoted herself to helping me in my work with
    much good will, intelligence, and common sense. So that she and
    I sincerely hope that Father will approve my taking her to
    wife. I cannot say otherwise than &ldquo;taking her,&rdquo; for
    the ceremony of marriage is not what makes her my wife, but it
    is a bond which already exists - a feeling that on both sides
    we love each other, help each other, and understand each
    other.</p>

    <p>And as to what Father will say about my marrying, I think he
    will say, &ldquo;Marry her.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I wish Father could get a fresh, clear impression of a new
    future for me, that he could see me here in surroundings quite
    different from what he possibly expected, that he could be
    quite reassured about my feeling for him and might have good
    courage for my future and forget the business of putting me
    under guardianship or supervision. See, Theo, I know of no
    shorter, no more honest way or means to redress quickly and
    practically the good understanding between us than the ones I'm
    writing you about. Write and tell me what you think of it.</p>

    <p>Also, I do not think it superfluous to tell you once more,
    though it is difficult to say it, what I feel for Sien. I have
    a feeling of being at home when I am with her, as though she
    gives me my own hearth, a feeling that our lives are
    interwoven. It is a heartfelt, deep feeling, serious and not
    without a dark shadow of her gloomy past and mine, a shadow
    which I have already written you about - as if something evil
    were threatening us which we would have to struggle against
    continuously all our lives. At the same time, however, I feel a
    great calm and brightness and cheerfulness at the thought of
    her and the straight path lying before me.</p>

    <p>You know I wrote you a lot about Kee last year, so I think
    you know what went on in my mind. Don't think that I
    exaggerated my feelings then; I had a strong, passionate love
    for her, quite different from that for Sien. When I
    unexpectedly learned in Amsterdam that she had a kind of
    aversion to me, that she considered my behaviour as coercing
    her and refused even to see me, and that &ldquo;she left the
    house as soon as I entered it&rdquo; - then, but not before,
    that love for her received a death blow. And I only perceived
    this when I awoke to reality here at The Hague this winter.</p>

    <p><label content="health.psychological">I then felt an inexpressible melancholy inside, which I
    cannot possibly describe. I know that then I often, often
    thought of a manly saying of father Millet's: Il m'a toujours
    sembl&eacute; que le suicide &eacute;tait une action de
    malhonn&ecirc;te homme. [It has always seemed to me that
    suicide was the deed of a dishonest man.]</p>

    <p>The emptiness, the unutterable misery within me made me
    think, Yes, I can understand people drowning themselves.</label> But I
    was far from approving this, I found strength in the
    above-mentioned saying, and thought it much better to take
    heart and find a remedy in work. And you know how I put this
    into practice. It is hard, very hard, aye, quite impossible to
    consider last year's love an illusion, as Father and Mother do,
    but I say, &ldquo;<i>Though it will never be, it might have
    been</i>.&rdquo; It was not illusion, but our viewpoints
    differed, and circumstances took such a turn that our paths
    diverged farther and farther, instead of coming together.</p>

    <p>This is what I think of it: my clear and sincere thought is,
    <i>It might have been, but now it is no longer possible</i>.
    Was Kee right in feeling an aversion to me? Was I wrong in
    persisting? I declare, I do not know. And it is not without
    pain and sorrow that I recall and write about it. I only wish I
    could understand why Kee acted that way, and also why my
    parents and hers were so steadfastly and ominously against it -
    less by their words, though certainly by them too, than by
    their complete lack of warm, live sympathy. I cannot soften
    these last words, but consider it a feeling of theirs which I
    want to forget.</p>

    <p>Now, as things are, it is like a large, deep wound which has
    healed but is still sensitive.</p>

    <p>Then last winter could I feel a new &ldquo;love&rdquo;
    immediately? Most certainly not. But is it wrong that those
    human feelings were not extinguished or deadened within me -
    and that my sorrow awoke within me a need for sympathy for
    others??? I think not. So at <i>first</i> Sien was to me only a
    fellow creature as lonesome and unhappy as myself. However, as
    I was not discouraged, I was then just in the mood to be able
    to give her some practical support, which at the same time
    helped me stand fast. But gradually and slowly it became
    different between us - <i>a real need of each other</i>, so
    that she and I could not be separated - our lives became more
    and more united, and then it was <i>love</i>.</p>

    <p>The feeling between Sien and me is real; it is no dream, it
    is reality. I think it is a great blessing that my thoughts and
    energy have found a fixed goal and a definite direction. It may
    be that what I felt for Kee was a stronger passion, and that
    she was in some respects more charming than Sien; but certainly
    not that my love for Sien should be less true, for the
    circumstances are too serious, and everything depends on doing
    things and being practical, and this has been so ever since the
    beginning, when I met her.</p>

    <p>Theo, I am now obliged to touch on a subject which will
    perhaps be painful to you, but which will possibly make you
    understand what I mean. In the past you also had an
    &ldquo;illusion,&rdquo; as Father and Mother call it, about a
    woman of the people; and it was not because you <i>could</i>
    not have chosen that path in life that nothing came of it after
    all, but because things in general took another turn. Now you
    have adapted yourself to life in another social station and are
    solidly situated, and if you should want to marry a girl of
    your own station, it would not mean a new
    &ldquo;illusion&rdquo; for <i>you</i>. You would not be
    admonished; and though nothing came of the first affair,
    something would certainly come of a new love affair, and you
    would be successful. As I see it, it would not be at all the
    right thing for you to take a woman of the people - for
    <i>you</i> the woman of the people was the so-called
    <i>illusion</i> - for you reality has become finding a woman of
    the same station in life as Kee Vos.</p>

    <p>But for me the opposite is true; my <i>illusion (although I
    do not think this word or this definition the least bit
    appropriate or correct either in your case or in
    mine</i><i>)</i> was Kee Vos - reality became the woman of the
    people.</p>

    <p>In many respects there is a difference between your case and
    mine. Your failure happened when you were twenty years old,
    mine happened last year; and although you as well as I may have
    been in for an illusion, or failure, or whatever it was - I
    really have no idea what to call it - this does not alter the
    fact that there is something real for you as well as for me.
    For I am definitely of the opinion that neither of us is fitted
    by nature to remain a bachelor.</p>

    <p>What I want to explain is this - what exists between Sien
    and me is <i>real</i>; it is not a dream, it is <i>reality</i>!
    Look at the result. When you come, you will not find me
    discouraged or melancholy; you will enter an atmosphere which
    will appeal to you, at least it will please you - a new studio,
    a young home in full swing. No mystical or mysterious studio
    but one that is rooted in real life <i>-</i> <i>a studio with a
    cradle</i>, a baby's crapper - where there is no stagnation,
    but where everything pushes and urges and stirs to
    activity.</p>

    <p>Now, if anybody should come and tell me that I am a poor
    financier, I shall show him my domain. I have done my best,
    brother, to take care that you will see (and not only you, but
    anyone with eyes in his head) that I aim at and sometimes
    succeed in doing things practically. <i>How to do it</i>. This
    winter we had the woman's pregnancy, my expenses for getting
    settled; now the woman has been confined, I have been ill for
    four weeks and am not yet well. Notwithstanding all this, the
    house is neat and bright and clean and well kept, and I have
    most of my furniture, beds and painting materials. It has cost
    what it has cost - indeed, I shall not minimize it - but then
    your money has not been thrown away. It has started a new
    studio which cannot do without your help even now, but which is
    going to produce more and more drawings, and which is full of
    furniture and working materials that are necessary and retain
    their value.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, if you come here to a home full of life and
    activity and know that you are the founder of it, won't that
    give you a real feeling of satisfaction - much more than if I
    were a bachelor living in bars? Would you wish it otherwise?
    You know my life has not always been happy, but very often
    miserable; and now through your help my youth has returned and
    my real self is developing.</p>

    <p>I only hope that you will keep this great change in mind,
    even when people think it foolish of you to have helped me and
    to continue helping me. And I hope that you will continue to
    see the germ of the next drawings in the present ones. A little
    time in the hospital and then I set to work again, the woman
    posing for me with the baby.</p>

    <p>To me it is as clear as day that one must feel what one
    draws, that one must live in the reality of family life if one
    wishes to express that family intimately - a mother with her
    child, a washerwoman, a seamstress, whatever it may be. Through
    constant practice the hand must gradually learn to obey that
    feeling. But to try to kill that feeling - that strong wish to
    have a household of my own - would be suicide. Therefore I say
    &ldquo;Forward,&rdquo; notwithstanding dark shadows, cares,
    difficulties - alas, often caused by the meddling and gossip of
    people. Theo, know it well - though I <i>keep out of it</i>, as
    you rightly advise me to do, it often grieves me to the heart.
    But do you know why I do not contradict them any more and why I
    keep out of it? Because I must do my work, and all that gossip
    and worry must not cause me to deviate from my path. But I do
    not keep out of it because I am afraid of them or because I am
    at a loss for an answer. Also, I often notice that they do not
    say anything when I am present, and even pretend they never
    said anything.</p>

    <p>As to you, since you know that I keep out of it so as not to
    make myself nervous and because of my work, you will also
    understand my attitude and not think it cowardly of me, won't
    you?</p>

    <p>Do not imagine that I think myself perfect or that I think
    that many people taking me for a disagreeable character is no
    fault of mine. I am often terribly melancholy, irritable,
    hungering and thirsting, as it were, for sympathy; and when I
    do not get it, I try to act indifferently, speak sharply, and
    often even pour oil on the fire. <label content="attitude.people">I do not like to be in
    company, and often find it painful and difficult to mingle with
    people, to speak to them.</label> But do you know what the cause is -
    if not at all, of a great deal of this? Simply nervousness; I
    am terribly sensitive, physically as well as morally, the
    nervousness having developed during those miserable years which
    drained my health. Ask any doctor, and he will understand at
    once that nights spent in the cold street or in the open, the
    anxiety to get bread, a continual strain because I was out of
    work, the estrangement from friends and family, caused at least
    three-fourths of my peculiarities of temper, and that those
    disagreeable moods or times of depression must be ascribed to
    this. But you, or anyone who will take the trouble to think it
    over, will not condemn me, I hope, because of it, nor find me
    unbearable. I try to fight it off, but that does not change my
    temperament; and even though this may be my bad side, confound
    it, I have a good side too, and can't they credit me with that
    also?</p>

    <p>Now tell me if you approve of the following little plan for
    telling Father and Mother and bringing about a better
    situation. I haven't the slightest desire to write about it or
    go and talk about it, because then I should relapse into my old
    failing, namely putting it in such a way that they would be
    hurt by some expression or other. Well, I think when the woman
    comes back with her baby and I am quite recovered and back from
    the hospital and the studio is in full swing - then I would
    like to say to Father, Will you visit me again now, and stay a
    few days with me to talk some things over? And then as a little
    gesture, I should enclose the money for the journey. I do not
    know of a better plan.</p>

    <p>Adieu, thanks for everything, a handshake and believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
