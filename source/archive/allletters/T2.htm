    <p>Letter T 2<br>
     Paris, 23 October 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p><label content="health.illness">It is very distressing to me to learn that you are not
    feeling well. <sup>1</sup> It is to be supposed that you have
    worked too hard, and consequently have forgotten to take proper
    care of your body.</label> I am glad that your letter arrived today,
    for within a very short time I should have gone off to
    Brussels, in which case you would have had to wait at least two
    more days. What a financier you are! What causes me so much
    grief is that, notwithstanding all that, you are always so
    miserably hard up, because you cannot refrain from doing all
    kinds of things for others. I should greatly like to see you
    more egotistic, at least until your budget balances better.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">You will understand that Father Thomas has given me the cold
    shoulder; you should have approached him yourself and all that.
    Now let's try to wriggle out of the difficulty; the others will
    come to us of their own accord.</label> You will be pleased to learn
    that I sold the big picture of Gauguin's &ldquo;Les
    Bretonnes,&rdquo; which has been on exhibition at Diot's. I am
    sending him 500 francs, so for the moment he will be quite well
    off, but is he going to join you? De Haan is coming this week,
    and he will stay with me for some time, which is very pleasant
    for me, for he will probably become the central figure of a
    group of young people here after a while.</p>

    <p>From your previous letter I get the impression that you
    believe that these fellows know all the answers to all the
    questions, in the manner of the Dutch, but if you have formed
    such an opinion it's my fault. When I told you that they known
    how to analyze a picture, taking as their starting point a
    feeling for the technique and so on, I did not mean to say that
    they separate the qualities; what I really meant to allude to
    was their singular clarity of mind, which prevents them from
    mixing things up. Isa&auml;cson, particularly, gives me the
    impression of a true scholar. They have now received pictures
    and studies done in Holland - very good, only a bit dark. It is
    their intention to stay in Paris during the winter, and then to
    start for the country as soon as the weather permits them to
    travel out of town. I intend to return from Brussels on Friday
    or Saturday, and I hope to be able to write you a letter less
    hurriedly soon.</p>

    <p>I hope your indisposition is not serious, and that you will
    not lose courage, even if Gauguin should not come.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
