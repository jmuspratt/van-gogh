    <p>W18 <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Saint-R&eacute;my, c. 20 December 1889</p>

    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p>I'm adding a word to you in great haste;<label content="health.mental"> it is exactly a
    year ago that I had that attack; I have no reason to complain
    too much, as things are going better with me at the moment, but
    it is to be feared that it will come back from time to time.
    And this leaves the head in a latent state of sensibility.</label> I
    hope you will like <art id=0655>the canvas for you and Mother</art> which I am
    working on at present a little. It is a repetition of <art id=0654>a picture
    for Theo, women gathering olives.</art></p>

    <p>I have been working very hard and ceaselessly for two weeks.
    Do you know the poem I have written on the opposite page?</p>

    <p>Whistler painted a picture of his mother which is like that.
    But we find this especially in our old Dutch pictures now and
    then. When I think of Mother it seems to me that she is very
    like that too.</p>

    <p>Life is not always very gay here, and my companions in
    distress are very often bored, but there is much resignation
    and patience here. But many of them are doing nothing, and
    remain absorbed in thought all day long, and now and then I
    feel inclined to believe that they would be better off in an
    asylum where manual labour was obligatory.</p>

    <p>See you soon, and I embrace you in thought.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>[written on the opposite page]</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Who is the maid my spirit seeks<br>

    Through cold reproof and slanders blight?<br>

    Has she love's roses on her cheek<br>

    Is hers an eye of calm delight?<br>

    No, wan and sunk with midnight prayer<br>

    And the pale looks of her I love,<br>

    And if by times a light be there<br>

    That light was kindled from above.<br>

    I choose not her mine heart's elect<br>

    Amongst those that seek their maker's shrine<br>

    In gems and garlands proudly decked<br>

    As if themselves were things divine.<br>

    No, heaven but faintly warms the breast<br>

    That beats beneath a broidered veil,<br>

    And they who come in glittering dress<br>

    To mourn their frailty--yet are frail.<br>

    Not to the form of her I love,<br>

    And love because her bloom is gone,<br>

    But ne'er was beauty's bloom so bright,<br>

    So touching as that form's decay,<br>

    That in the altar's wavering light<br>

    In holy lustre fades away.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>
