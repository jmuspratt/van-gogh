  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I was very glad to get your letter and thank you warmly for
    what was enclosed. But I am very sorry that probably sending it
    to me after all inconvenienced you more than you say. I
    sincerely hope that you have got that money back since.
    <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>So Hendrik has also returned from the Indies. Were he and
    his family in good health? Or was ill health the cause for
    their return? In the past Hendrik made a much less favourable
    impression on me than his two brothers - is this your opinion
    too?</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Lately I have been working with printer's ink, which is
    diluted with turpentine and applied with a brush. It gives very
    deep tones of black. Diluted with some Chinese white, it also
    gives good greys. By adding more or less turpentine, one can
    even wash it in very thinly.</label></p>

    <p>I think it will give good results on that paper Buhot gave
    you.</p>

    <p>Sometime when you are here we'll talk that matter over, and
    I will show you drawings that might be made on it. A year ago
    it puzzled me, how to get some very deep tones of black, but I
    found a few of them in the printer's office. So now I can
    penetrate a little further into seeking for plastic effects and
    chiaroscuro.</p>

    <p>Thanks for the good wishes on my birthday. It happened to be
    a very pleasant day, as I just had an excellent model for a
    digger. One thing I can assure you of, the work gets more and
    more stimulating, and it gives me, so to speak, more vitality;
    and then I always think of you, because it is you who make it
    possible for me to work. That is, without fatal obstacles,
    without direct handicaps. Difficulties sometimes spur one on
    even more. Now the time has come to put more energy into
    it.</p>

    <p>My ideal is to work with more and more models, quite a herd
    of poor peoples to whom the studio would be a kind of harbour
    of refuge on winter days, or when they are out of work or in
    great need. Where they would know that there was fire, food and
    drink for them, and a little money to be earned. At present
    this is so only on a very small scale, but I hope it will grow.
    Right now I confine myself to a few models, and stick to them -
    I cannot spare one of them, but would have use for some
    more.</p>

    <p>You write about some art lovers who might take my work some
    time, even though it shouldn't become exactly a current
    article. Well, I really believe the same. If I should succeed
    in putting some warmth and love into my work, it will find its
    friends. The thing is to keep on working.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">I am glad your patient is progressing, though slowly. It is
    beautiful spring weather here, the evenings are indescribably
    beautiful. If the weather is the same in Paris, it will do her
    good. Is she up already?</label></p>

    <p>Today I have the old man again, and must go and get my
    things ready.</p>

    <p>This week I met Van der Weele again, and also expect him
    here one of these days.</p>

    <p>Probably you will be very busy with the Salon. I suppose you
    can't tell me approximately when you will come to Holland yet,
    can you? Have a good time, and if you have a moment to spare,
    write me again. Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
