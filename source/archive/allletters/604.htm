    <p>Saint-R&eacute;my, 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup>
    September 1889</p>

    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>I have already written to you, but there are still quite a
    few things you said to me that I haven't answered yet. Firstly,
    that you have rented a room in Tanguy's house and that my
    canvases are there, which is very interesting - provided you
    aren't paying too much for it - the expenses go on all the time
    and the canvases still take so long to bring anything in - it
    often frightens me.</p>

    <p>Be that as it may, I'm sure it's a very good step, and I
    thank you for taking it, as for so many other things. It is
    curious that Maus had the idea of inviting young Bernard and me
    for the next Vingtistes exhibition. I should like to exhibit
    with them very much, though I'm conscious of my inferiority by
    the side of so many tremendously talented Belgians.</p>

    <p>This Mellery, now, is a great artist. And has been one for a
    number of years. But I shall try my best to do something good
    this autumn.</p>

    <p>I am working away in my room without interruption which does
    me good and chases away what I imagine are abnormal ideas.</p>

    <p>Thus I've done <art id=0482>the painting of the Bedroom</art> <art id=0484>once more</art>.
    That's certainly one of my best studies - and sooner
    or later it must definitely be <i>relined</i>. <label content="art.technique">It was painted
    so quickly and has dried in such a way that the turpentine
    evaporated straight away and the paint hasn't stuck firmly to
    the canvas at all. That will also have happened with other
    studies of mine painted very quickly and with a very full
    brush.</label><label content="art.support"> Anyway, after some time this thin canvas deteriorates
    and cannot take a lot of impasto.</label> You've got some excellent
    stretchers, damn it, if I had some like that to work with, I'd
    be a lot better off than with these laths you get here which
    warp in the sun.</p>

    <p>They say - and I am very willing to believe it - that it is
    difficult to know oneself - but it isn't easy to paint oneself
    either. So I am working on two self-portraits at the moment -
    for want of another model.</p>

    <p>Because it is high time I did a little figure work. <art id=0626>In the
    one I began the first day I got up, I was thin and deathly
    pale. It is dark purple-blue, and the head whitish with yellow
    hair, thus with a colour effect</art>.</p>

    <p>But I have since started <art id=0627>another, three-quarter profile on a
    light background</art>.</p>

    <p>Then I'm retouching this summers studies - in fact, I am
    working morning, noon and night.</p>

    <p>Are you well? - damn it, I really wish that you were 2 years
    further on and that these early days of your marriage, however
    lovely they may be at times, were behind you. I'm quite
    convinced that a marriage grows better with time, and that it's
    <i>then</i> that your constitution will recover.</p>

    <p>So take things with a pinch of northern equanimity, and look
    after yourselves, both of you. This confounded life in the
    world of art is exhausting, it seems.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">Day by day my own strength is returning, and already I feel
    I have almost too much of it again. For one doesn't need to be
    a Hercules to remain hard at work at the easel.</label></p>

    <p>What you told me about Maus having been to see my canvases
    made me think a lot about the Belgian painters these last few
    days and also during my illness.<label content="feelings.homesick"> As a result I was overwhelmed
    with memories as by an avalanche, and I tried to recall the
    whole of that school of modern Flemish artists until I felt as
    homesick as a fish out of water.</label></p>

    <p>Which isn't any good, because our way lies - forwards - and
    retracing our steps is both impossible and impermissible. In
    other words one can think about the past without being swamped
    by an over-melancholic nostalgia.</p>

    <p>Anyway, Henri Conscience may not be a perfect writer by any
    means, but no two ways about it, what a painter! And what human
    kindness in what he said and hoped for. There's a preface in
    one of his books on my mind all the time (the one to Le
    Conscrit), where he writes that he had been very ill, and says
    that during his illness, despite all his efforts, he felt his
    affection for mankind draining away, but that his feeling of
    love returned on long walks in the countryside.</p>

    <p>The inevitability of suffering and despair - well, here I
    am, bucked up again for a time - and I thank him for it.</p>

    <p>I am writing you this letter bit by bit in the intervals
    when I am worn out with painting. The work is going pretty
    well. I'm struggling with <art id=0618>a canvas I started a few days before
    my illness - a reaper. The study is all yellow, extremely
    thickly painted, but the subject was beautiful and simple. For
    I see in this reaper - a vague figure toiling away for all he's
    worth in the midst of the heat to finish his task - I see in
    him the image of death, in the sense that humanity might be the
    wheat he is reaping. So it is, if you like, the opposite of the
    sower which I tried to do before. But there's no sadness in
    this death, this one takes place in broad daylight with a sun
    flooding everything with light of pure gold.</art></p>

    <p>Well, here I am, at it again. But I won't give in, and shall
    try once more on a new canvas. Ah, I could almost believe that
    I have a new spell of lucidity before me.</p>

    <p>So what next - carrying on here for the next few months, or
    moving elsewhere - I don't know. It's just that the attacks,
    when they come, are no joke, and running the risk of having a
    bout like that at your place or at anyone else's house is a
    serious business.</p>

    <p>My dear brother - I always write to you in between bouts of
    work, and I am working like one truly possessed, more than ever
    I am in the grip of a pent-up fury of work, and I'm sure it
    will help to cure me. Perhaps something along the lines of what
    Eug. Delacroix spoke of will happen to me - &ldquo;I discovered
    painting when I had neither teeth or breath left,&rdquo; in the
    sense that my sad illness makes me work in a pent-up fury- very
    slowly - but without leaving off from morning till night - and
    - that is probably the secret - to work long and slowly. But
    what do I know about it? Still, I think I've one or two
    canvases on the go which are not too bad, firstly, the reaper
    in the yellow wheat, and the portrait on a light background
    which should go to the Vingtistes, if indeed they remember me
    when the time comes. Actually, I care very little one way or
    another, it might be preferable if they did forget all about
    me.</p>

    <p>For my part, I do not forget how inspired I am whenever I
    give my memory of certain Belgians free rein. That is the
    positive side, and the rest is of no more than secondary
    importance.</p>

    <p>And here we are already in September, soon we will be in the
    middle of autumn, and then winter.</p>

    <p>I shall continue to work without let-up, and then if I have
    another attack around Christmas, we'll see, and when that's
    over, I can't see any objection to my telling the
    administration here to go to hell, and to my returning north
    for a fairly long time. To leave now, when I believe I may well
    have another attack this winter, that's to say in three months'
    time, would perhaps be too foolhardy.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.reclusive">It's been six weeks since I put a foot outdoors, even in
    the garden. Next week, however, when I've finished the canvases I'm
    busy with, I'm going to have a go.</label></p>

    <p>But another few months and I'll be so flabby and lethargic
    that a change will probably do me a lot of good.</p>

    <p>That's the way I'm thinking at the moment, though of course
    nothing is settled.</p>

    <p>But I do believe that one shouldn't stand on ceremony with
    the people of this establishment, any more than of the
    proprietors of a hotel. We have rented a room from them for a
    certain length of time, and they are well paid for what they
    provide, and that's absolutely all there is to it.</p>

    <p>Not to mention that they might like nothing better than for
    my condition to be chronic, and we would be unforgivably stupid
    to gave in to them. They make far too many inquiries, to my
    mind, not only about what I am, but also what you earn,
    etc.</p>

    <p>So let's not quarrel with them and simply give them the
    slip.</p>

    <p>I am continuing this letter again at intervals. Yesterday I
    began <art id=0629>the portrait of the chief attendant</art>, and
    I may do his wife as well, since he is married and lives in a
    little farmhouse a stone's throw from the institution.</p>

    <p>A most interesting face. There's a beautiful etching by
    Legros of an old Spanish grandee - if you remember it, it will
    give you an idea of the type.</p>

    <p>He was at the hospital in Marseilles during two cholera
    epidemics, in short, he is a man who has seen an enormous
    amount of suffering and death, and he has an indefinable
    expression of quiet contemplation, so that I am irresistibly
    reminded of Guizot's face - for there is something of that in
    his head, if different. But he is a man of the people and
    simpler. Anyway, you will see it if I succeed in doing it and
    if I make a copy of it.</p>

    <p>I am struggling with all my might to keep my work under
    control by telling myself that success would be the best
    lightning rod for my illness. I make sure I don't overdo
    things, and take care to keep myself to myself. It's selfish,
    if you like, not getting used to my companions in misfortune
    here and not going round to see them, but still, I feel none
    the worse for it, for my work is making headway, and that's
    what we need, for it is absolutely vital that I do better that
    before, as that was not enough.</p>

    <p>Supposing I get out of here one day, wouldn't it be far
    better if I came back definitely capable of doing a portrait
    with some character than if I came back as I started? That's
    clumsily put, for I'm well aware one cannot say, &ldquo;I know
    how to do a portrait,&rdquo; without telling a lie, because
    that is an infinite objective. Still you will understand what I
    mean, that I must do better than before.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">At the moment my mind is working in an orderly way, and I
    feel completely normal - and when I look at my present
    condition, in the hope of generally having, between the attacks
    - if, unfortunately, it is to be expected that they will return
    from time to time - of having in between times, periods of
    lucidity and of working - when I look at my present condition,
    then I do indeed tell myself that it won't do to become
    obsessed with being sick. And that I must firmly continue my
    humble career as a painter. And so, staying in an asylum for
    ever would probably be going too far.</label></p>

    <p>A few days ago, I was reading in the Figaro about a Russian
    writer who also suffered from a nervous illness of which,
    moreover, he sadly died, and which brought on terrible attacks
    from time to time [Dostoevsky]. But what is one to do? There is
    no remedy, or if there is one, it is to work with a will.</p>

    <p>I am dwelling on this more than I should.</p>

    <p>All in all, I prefer to be definitely ill like this than be
    the way I was in Paris when all this was brewing.</p>

    <p>You will also see that when you put the portrait with the
    light background that I have just done next to those portraits
    I did of myself in Paris, you really will see that I look saner
    now than I did then, indeed much more so.</p>

    <p>I am even inclined to believe that the portrait will tell
    you better than my letter how I am, and that it will reassure
    you - it took me a lot of trouble to do.</p>

    <p>And the &ldquo;Reaper&rdquo; is also going well, I think -
    it is very, very simple.</p>

    <p>By the end of the month I'd go so far as to say you can
    count on 12 size 30 canvases, but in most cases they will be
    the same picture twice over, a study and the final
    painting.</p>

    <p>Still, perhaps my journey to the south will yet bear fruit,
    for the stronger light and the blue sky teaches you to see,
    especially, or even only, if you see it all for a long
    time.</p>

    <p>The north will undoubtedly seem quite new to me, and I have
    looked at things so much here that I have become very attached
    to them, and I shall feel sad for a long time.</p>

    <p>Something odd occurs to me - in Manette Salomon there is a
    discussion of modern art, and some artist or other, talking of
    &ldquo;what will last,&rdquo; says that what will last is
    &ldquo;the landscape painters&rdquo; - that view has already
    been proved true to some extent, for Corot, Daubigny,
    Dupr&eacute;, Rousseau, and Millet do endure as landscape
    painters, and when Corot said on his deathbed, &ldquo;I saw
    landscapes in a dream with skies all pink, it was
    charming,&rdquo; well, yes, we see those skies all pink in
    Monet, Pissarro, and Renoir, so the landscape painters do last
    very well, it's quite true. We'll leave aside the figure
    painting of Delacroix and Millet.</p>

    <p>In any case, what is it that we are now beginning
    hesitatingly to recognize as original and long-lasting?
    <i>Portraiture</i>. You might say that it's old stuff, but it's
    also quite new. We'll talk about it again - but we must never
    stop being on the lookout for portraits, especially by artists
    such as Guillaumin - that portrait of the young girl by
    Guillaumin! - and take good care of my portrait by Russell
    which I'm so fond of. Have you framed<art id=avalsp> Laval's portrait? I don't
    think you told me what you thought of it. I thought it
    splendid, that gaze through the glasses, such a frank gaze.</art></p>

    <p>My urge to do portraits is very strong these days, in fact
    Gauguin and I talked about this and similar matters until our
    nerves were strained to the point of stifling all human
    warmth.</p>

    <p>But I dare say some good pictures will come out of it, and
    that's what we're after. And I should imagine they'll be doing
    some good work in Brittany. I got a letter from Gauguin, I
    think I already told you, and one day I should very much like
    to see what they are doing.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">I must ask for the following things for painting.</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    10 meters of canvas<br>

    <i>Large</i> tubes 6 tubes zinc white<br>

    2 tubes emerald green<br>

    2 tubes cobalt<br>

    <i>Small</i> tubes 2 carmine<br>

    1 vermilion<br>

    1 large tube crimson lake<br>

    6 marten brushes, black hair<br></label>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>Then I promised the attendant here a copy of Le Monde
    Illustr&eacute;, No. 1684, July 6, 1889, in which there
    is a pretty engraving after Demont-Breton.</p>

    <p>There! The reaper is finished. I think it'll be one of those
    you'll keep at home - it's an image of death as the great book
    of nature speaks of it - but the effect I've been looking for
    is - &ldquo;on the point of smiling.&rdquo; It's all yellow,
    except for a line of purple hills. A pale and golden yellow. I
    find it odd that I saw it like that through the iron bars of a
    cell.</p>

    <p>Well, do you know what I hope for, once I allow myself begin
    to hope? It is that the family will be for you what nature, the
    lumps of soil, the grass, the yellow wheat, the peasant, are
    for me, in other words, that you find in your love for people
    something <i>not only to work for</i>, but to comfort and
    restore you when you need it. So, I beg you not to let yourself
    get too exhausted by business, but to take good care of
    yourselves, both of you - perhaps there will still be some good
    in the not too distant future.</p>

    <p>I've a good mind to do the &ldquo;Reaper&rdquo; over again
    for Mother. If not, I'll do another picture for her birthday -
    it will be coming later, as I'll send it on with the rest.</p>

    <p>For I am convinced that Mother would understand it - since
    it is, in fact, as simple as one of those primitive woodcuts
    one finds in farmer's almanacs.</p>

    <p>Send me the canvas as soon as you can, for if I still want
    to do other copies for the sisters, and if I am to make a start
    on the new autumn effects, I'll have enough to fill my time
    from the beginning of this month to the end.</p>

    <p>I'm eating and drinking like a horse at present. I must say
    that the doctor is taking very good care of me.</p>

    <p>Yes, I do think that it's a good idea to do some pictures
    for Holland, for Mother and our two sisters. That will make
    three, that is to say the Reaper, the Bedroom, the Olive
    trees<i>,</i> Wheat Field and Cypress. It will even make four,
    for there's somebody else I'm going to do one for as well.</p>

    <p>I shall work at that, of course, with as much pleasure as
    for the Vingtistes, and more calmly. Since I feel strong, you
    may be sure that I shall get through a lot of work.</p>

    <p>I am choosing the best from the twelve subjects, so that
    what they'll get will have been thought about a bit and
    specially picked. And then, it's a good thing to work for
    people who don't know what a picture is.</p>

    <p>A good handshake for you and Jo.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I have re-opened this letter again to tell you that I have
    just seen M. Peyron. I hadn't seen him for six days.</p>

    <p>He told me that this month he expects to go to Paris, and he
    will see you there.</p>

    <p>This pleases me, because he has - this is certain - lots of
    experience and I know he will tell you frankly what he
    thinks.</p>

    <p>To me he only said &ldquo;Hope that it never comes
    back.&rdquo; But I expect it to return for a good long time, at
    least for several years.</p>

    <p>But I also expect that work, far from being impossible for
    me in the intervals, can go on as usual, and it may even be my
    remedy.</p>

    <p>And then once again I tell you - other than Mr. doctor
    Peyron - that with regard to the administration here it is
    probably necessary to be polite, but we must limit ourselves to
    that, and not bind ourselves to anything.</p>

    <p>It is a very serious thought that wherever I should live
    here for any length of time, I would perhaps be subject to
    popular prejudices - I do not even know what these prejudices
    are - that would make my life with them unbearable.</p>

    <p>But after all I will wait for what M. Peyron says to you, I
    have no idea of what his opinion may be. This afternoon I have
    been working on the portrait of the attendant, which is getting
    on. If it were not a good deal softened - completely softened -
    by an intelligent look and an expression of kindliness, it
    would be a veritable bird of prey. It is very much a Southern
    type.</p>

    <p>I wonder whether M. Peyron's intended journey will come off
    this time. I am very curious to know what may come of it.</p>

    <p>After another year I shall perhaps attain command of myself
    from the artistic point of view.</p>

    <p>And that is always a thing worth seeking. But for that I
    must have some luck.</p>

    <p>What I dream of in my best moments is not so much striking
    colour effects as once more the half tones. And certainly the
    visit to the Montpellier gallery contributed to turning my
    ideas this way. For what touched me there even more than the
    magnificent Courbets, which are marvels - the &ldquo;Village
    Girls,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Sleeping Spinner&rdquo; - were the
    portraits of Brias by Delacroix and by Ricard, then the
    &ldquo;Daniel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Odalisques&rdquo; by Delacroix,
    all in half tones. For these &ldquo;Odalisques&rdquo; are quite
    a different thing from those in the Louvre, mostly in violet
    tones.</p>

    <p>But in these half tones, what choice and what quality!</p>

    <p>It is time I sent off this letter at last - I could tell you
    in two pages what it contains, that is to say, nothing new, but
    then I haven't time to do it again.</p>

    <p>A good handshake once more and if it is not too much
    trouble, let me have the canvas as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent.</p>
