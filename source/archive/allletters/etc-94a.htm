    <p>[Reprinted from the column &ldquo;Among People" (Onder de
    mensen) by M. J. Brusse in the <i>Nieuwe Rotterdamse
    Courant</i>, a well-known Rotterdam newspaper, of May 26 and
    June 2, 1914.]</p>

    <p>VINCENT VAN GOGH AS BOOKSELLER'S CLERK</p>

    <p>Among a group of art lovers not long ago the conversation
    turned to Vincent van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo, which
    his sister-in-law, Mrs. J. van Gogh-Bonger, was busily and
    painstakingly arranging and annotating for publication in
    three heavy volumes. Dr. Jan Veth <sup>1</sup> told us about
    it. A long time ago, he said, he had been allowed to read them
    in manuscript. He was very impressed by the noble sentiment
    expressed in them and by their occasional utter simplicity.
    Those of his English period had struck him as especially
    powerful.</p>

    <p>For a while the conversation continued spontaneously about
    the artist and the art dealer, the close friendship between the
    two brothers, which, particularly on Theo's part was not less
    than heroic in its self-sacrifice.</p>

    <p>Johan de Meester <sup>2</sup> knew instances of this,
    observed during his own years in Paris. He also showed us the
    precious collection of Vincent's letters to their mutual
    friend, the young painter Van Rappard, most of them illustrated
    with pen drawings</p>

    <p>And in the course of this interesting discussion, in which
    among others the director of the Boymans Museum in Rotterdam,
    Mr. Schmidt Degener <sup>3</sup>, as well as that excellent
    young art critic Dirk Coster, took part, Jan Veth observed with
    a smile: &ldquo;I never spoke to Vincent van Gogh - however, as
    a boy in Dordrecht, I often used to see him when he sold those
    coloured halfpenny prints to the schoolchildren at
    Bluss&eacute; and Van Braam's bookshop.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;In case you should think it worth your while to
    investigate this Dordrecht episode,&rdquo; Dr. Veth suggested,
    &ldquo;just make a note of the name of Mr. Braat. His father
    was the owner of the bookshop where Van Gogh worked. It is
    certain that the son, Mr. D. Braat, witnessed Vincent's
    behavior there. And he still has an interest in the firm of
    Bluss&eacute; and Van Braam.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>That same night I wrote to the address given me, requesting,
    if possible, some particulars about Vincent van Gogh as a ...
    bookseller's clerk.</p>

    <p>Mr. Braat very kindly replied:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;On the strength of a letter from my brother Frans,
    who in those days was an employee of the firm of Boussod
    Valadon &amp; Co., where he often came into contact with Mr.
    Theo van Gogh (Vincent's brother), my father decided to give
    Vincent a job in the shop operated by the firm of
    Bluss&eacute; &amp; Van Braam.</p>

    <p>In those days it never occurred to anybody that Vincent van
    Gogh possessed so much talent; as for myself, he always made a
    queer impression on me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>A few days later I stood before the still imposing bookshop
    on the ground floor of the big old-fashioned house on Voor
    Street where Vincent van Gogh once wrote delivery notes,
    standing at his small desk. But I was urged to go upstairs to
    the enormous living room which resembled a hall, taking up the
    full width of this patrician house; in their sedate stateliness
    thc appointments were probably much the same as in the days
    when Vincent knew it.</p>

    <p>And my host, with his beautifully trimmed white beard,
    sitting at his old-fashioned writing desk, was already telling
    me some of his brother Frans's stories; he had often met Theo
    van Gogh in Paris, and had written to Father Braat about
    Vincent &ldquo;&hellip;For if you ask me, I am under the
    impression that the family did not really know what to do with
    the boy in those days. First he had been employed at Goupil's
    in The Hague, in which his uncle Vincent was a partner; then he
    was sent to England and Paris by them, and after he returned to
    Holland, his parents were extremely worried about him. In point
    of fact, there was no vacancy in my father's shop. The staff
    was quite sufficient&hellip; But you know how it is - my father
    did not like to turn down Frans's request, and so he came here;
    he had a little desk downstairs where he stood working</p>

    <p>But <i>when</i> all this happened, Mr. Braat could no more
    remember than Dr. Veth.</p>

    <p>However, perhaps there was somebody who knew; Mr. Rijken,
    now a retired corn chandler, with whom Vincent boarded in those
    days in Tolbrugstraatje [Tollbridge Alley] over the way.
    &ldquo;We might call on him after a while.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mr. Braat knew that Van Gogh had come as an apprentice and
    Theo had been very grateful to Mr. Braat's father for this. In
    theory Vincent had the show goods, and now and then the
    delivery goods, under his care&hellip; but when ever anyone
    looked at what he was doing, it was found that instead of
    working, he was translating the Bible into French, German and
    English, in four columns, with the Dutch text in addition.</p>

    <p>He was puttering at this mostly. At other times when you
    happened to look, you caught him making little sketches, such
    silly pen-and-ink drawings, a little tree with a lot of
    branches and side branches and twigs - nobody ever saw anything
    else in it. (Although it turned out that afterward, when this
    work had come so much into vogue, Mr. Braat had taken a good
    look through Vincent's little desk from top to bottom! ... But
    not the slightest vestige of his handiwork was to be found,
    neither outside nor in.)</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, as for business...&rdquo; My aged host laughed
    with a scarcely concealed twinkling of mockery in his eyes.
    &ldquo;For he had taken it into his foolish head to study
    theology and become a clergyman. At the time the Reverend Mr.
    Keller van Hoorn was at his peak in Dordrecht, and Van Gogh
    went to ask his advice. But the clergyman thought the
    preliminary study too hard for him. Not that he lacked the
    energy - but it was a fact that he had never been to a grammar
    school. The Reverend Mr. Van Hoorn wanted to show him the way
    to become a missionary, but Vincent did not care for this idea
    at all; he much preferred to study.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;For that matter, his father was a clergyman. `I want
    to be a shepherd like my father,' he would say to me sometimes.
    `But my dear boy,' I once warned him, `don't you think it's too
    bad that after so many years your father has not been able to
    get anything better than Etten and De Leur?'</p>

    <p>&ldquo;This was the only time I ever saw Van Gogh angry: His
    father was absolutely in the right place; a true shepherd.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Well, shortly afterward Vincent went to Amsterdam and
    was taken in by his uncle, the rear admiral, in whose house he
    started studying Latin and Greek in an attic. Since then I have
    lost sight of him I cannot say I was particularly interested.
    <label content="lifestyle.appearance">No, he was not an attractive
    boy, with those small, narrowed, peering eves of his and, in fact,
    he was always a bit unsociable.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And then I remember well that he always preferred to
    wear a top hat, a bit of respectability he had brought back
    from England; but such a hat - you were afraid you might tear
    its brim off if you took hold of it. I have often puzzled over
    his exact age, hut I cannot find out, for instance, whether he
    was old enough to he called up for the militia.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But he was certainly obliging, and physically very strong,
    though he did not look it.</label> During one of those frequent floods
    Mr. Braat had admired his physical strength and good nature. At
    the time he lived in Tolbrugstraatje - in a room with
    whitewashed walls, my informant believed, on which he had made
    all kinds of sketches and crude drawings. But his landlord, who
    did not like this at all, had repainted them later on. However
    this may have been - that particular night everything was
    flooded. Without hesitating for a moment, Van Gogh rushed out
    of the house and waded through the water to his employer's
    house in order to warn him. For Bluss&eacute; and Van
    Braam's storehouse was next door to his boarding-house All the
    next morning he was lifting those heavy wet stacks of paper and
    carrying them upstairs. After all these years Mr. Braat still
    spoke with admiration of so much physical strength.</p>

    <p>Also, Van Gogh was always as compliant as possible. For all
    that, he now and then could irritate the old gentleman into
    peevishness: &ldquo;Good heavens! that boy's standing there
    translating the Bible again.&rdquo; But he could not be trusted
    to serve the public and such, except perhaps to sell a quire of
    letter paper or a halfpenny print once in a while. For he had
    not the slightest knowledge of the book trade, and he did not
    make any attempt to learn....</p>

    <p>On the contrary, he was excessively interested in religion.
    &ldquo;On Sunday he always went to church, preferably an
    orthodox one&hellip; And during the week, well, we started work
    here at eight o'clock in the morning; at one o'clock he went
    home to lunch until three; and then he came back in the evening
    for a few hours.<label content="attitude.people"> For the rest,
    he had no intercourse with anybody; he led an absolutely solitary
    life. He took many walks all over the island, but always alone.
    In the shop he hardly spoke a word. In short, he was something of a
    recluse.&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.appearance">This was confirmed by Miss
    Braat, who lives with her brother over the book-shop. &ldquo;I
    never thought there was anything particular about him. Honestly,
    I always thought of him as a real dullard .... And as he was
    always working on his Bible by night, Father used to say, `That
    boy is no good to me, for he
    is always drowsy in the daytime....' &rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>&ldquo;But his behavior was beyond reproach. He went
    straight home from here. Think of it, not once did he visit the
    family upstairs; he never said a single word to me, when as a
    young girl I used to pass through the shop. And so, when he
    became obsessed with the idea of being a preacher, Pa told him,
    `My lad, if you believe your road in life lies that way, you
    should take it, by all means.' &rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Apart from this I do not believe there is anybody in
    Dordrecht who knew him,&rdquo; was Mr. Braat's opinion.
    &ldquo;Upon my word, he was such a queer fish. Intercourse with
    painters, for instance? Member of Pictura? Never! In our
    business, too, he was really next to useless... For he had been
    at Goupil's, the art dealer's, for quite a while before then.
    My father bought his prints from them. But never think that Van
    Gogh left his desk when the samples arrived. No, it looked as
    if he were suffering from a sense of injury - there was
    something lonesome about him. When you saw him, you pitied
    him&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

    <p>A moment later Mr. Braat pointed out to me in the shop,
    which was arranged a bit differently at the time, the spot
    where Vincent had stood through the day. And across the way, in
    the same little square, the ancient facade of the former public
    weighhouse behind the elms&hellip; To one side was the
    delicious view of the Voorstraat Harbor, surrounded by
    old-fashioned houses, with their picturesque little roofs and
    railings and skylights, standing in the water with wet feet, as
    it were - the lower walls juicily moist and weather-beaten.</p>

    <p>Vincent van Gogh could reach his home across this square in
    half a minute - that house in funny, narrow Tollbridge Alley.
    It is a little old alley in which there are some condemned
    houses. But the corn chandler's shop is still there, clean and
    neat, with trim, carefully painted flour bins and a nice little
    white archway leading to the back of the house. On the fanlight
    one may read, as of old, the words painted with graceful
    flourishes: &ldquo;All Corn Chandler's Wares, Wheaten and Rye
    Flour. P. Rijken.&rdquo; And this although the shop has been
    sold and Vincent's former landlord has retired and is now
    living at the Boerenvismarkt (Peasant Fish Market).</p>

    <p>Mr. Rijken received us kindly and hospitably. He is a
    well-preserved, lively man considering his years; a blithe
    &ldquo;retired gentleman&rdquo; in a small way, with side
    whiskers and a long Gouda clay pipe.... But we should realize
    that his wife often had some four or five young gentlemen as
    boarders; he had his business to attend to and could not take
    too much notice of them - though for that matter he remembered
    Mr. Van Gogh quite well.... He was a queer chap, and no
    mistake. Many a time during those days Mr. Rijken would go
    upstairs to his room, where he would be drawing in one of those
    blue smocks: &ldquo;Come on, Van Gogh, you should go to
    bed....&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He had his moods, you see? For instance, sometimes he did
    not go home to dinner in the afternoon. He simply kept on
    walking.... Well, such things would never do for Mrs. Rijken.
    For she was thoroughly generous - a true mother to the boys -
    and when he arrived at last, she would give him a piece of her
    mind. But somehow it made no impression. And he called eating a
    luxury!</p>

    <p>Consequently, the other young gentlemen made fun of him. But
    the landlord would not stand for it. As a matter of fact, he
    pitied Vincent a little. And the young fellow liked the Rijkens
    very much. Van Gogh liked talking to them about London once in
    a while best of all. But during dinner, for instance, he was
    singularly silent. If Mrs. Rijken were still alive, she might
    have told a lot about his peculiarities.</p>

    <p>As for Mr. Rijken himself - when he was in business, he
    never used to get up to go to the cornloft later than three
    o'clock in the morning. And then, again and again, there was
    that shuffling in Van Gogh's room. The walls were full of
    drawings; he simply fixed them with nails ruthlessly driven
    into the good wall-paper....</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Wasn't his room whitewashed?&rdquo; I ventured.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Dear me, no! Whoever told you such nonsense?&rdquo;
    he answered. &ldquo;In our house everything was neat and trim
    upstairs, and that was why I could not stand this Van Gogh
    covering the walls with those drawings and driving nails into
    the wallpaper.... In fact, in my heart I made fun of him, too,
    about those drawings. For they were not a bit good, you see.
    The most childish stuff. Kind of small landscapes -
    <i>images</i>, if you know what I mean.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Occasionally, well, speaking frankly, it was as if
    the fellow was out of his mind. And then I sometimes kicked up
    a row, for we really were like a father and mother to those
    boys&hellip; But that spooky business in the night. And he
    bought the candles for it himself - don't get the idea that he
    got so much light from me! Oil cost good money, too. Besides, I
    was afraid of a fire - because he was so queer. What young
    gentleman would ever think of sitting about in a smock? He
    looked like an immigrant....</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And yet those lads had a very cosy life together. At
    the back of the house they had a glorious view of some gardens.
    And especially during the second half of the month, when they
    hadn't a penny to bless themselves with, they would huddle
    together, smoking each other's tobacco, and having fun&hellip;
    Orelio <sup>4</sup> later came and sang there hundreds of
    times....</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You see, I had killed a fat pig, and the young
    gentlemen had to eat of it too.... But all the things this Van
    Gogh drew, well, I thought them just trash.... laughable. <label content="lifestyle.reclusive">And
    to tell the honest truth, I was never able to see through him.
    I was never able to discover what he was really after.... The
    only thing I know is that he avoided the other boys as much as
    possible; he always wanted to be alone.</label></p>

    <p>&ldquo; `Van Gogh, you ought to eat.' How often I used to
    say this to him.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;But no. `I am not in want of any food; eating is a
    luxury.'</p>

    <p>&ldquo;On the other hand, the others told me that during his
    walks he would buy a roll, munching it in the streets. This
    really mortified us - as if we didn't give him enough to eat!
    But after all, he was a bit like the Wandering Jew. And if they
    are buying those drawings of his now, all I can say is, One
    folly buys the other....</p>

    <p>&ldquo; `Mind my wallpaper; you ruin everything with your
    nails.' For he hammered away like mad. But nothing could
    influence him - not even the scoldings he got from my wife for
    staying away all through Sunday... on the other hand, he never
    got cross&hellip;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It was always the same: `I don't want food, I don't
    want a night's rest.' But then I had a word with your pa, Mr.
    Braat&hellip; for at first he said his late bouts were due to
    the pressure of business. Later on he told us he kept roaming
    about because he needed quiet... And yet I could not stand the
    young gentlemen teasing him. I don't know why, but I kept
    seeing him as a scapegoat....&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Rijken had told me that Mr. P. C. G&ouml;rlitz, then
    a young schoolmaster, now retired History Master of the
    Secondary School at Nimeguen, had been a fellow boarder of
    Vincent van Gogh's. I received from Nimeguen a most courteous
    reply to my letter on this subject, the greater part of which
    follows:</p>

    <p>At the time when I was an assistant teacher boarding with
    Mr. Rijken and his wife together with an apprentice in the book
    and art shop of the firm of Bluss&eacute; &amp; Van
    Braam, lodgings were applied for there by Mr. Vincent van Gogh,
    employed by the same firm as a bookkeeper and an art salesman.
    The boss, as we called our landlord, asked me, &ldquo;Would you
    object to sharing your room with Mr. Van Gogh, sir? Otherwise,
    I haven't enough room for him, and I should very much like to
    take him in.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, provided he is a decent fellow.&rdquo; So it
    came about that Mr. V. v. G. and I became fellow boarders and
    roommates.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.appearance">He was a singular man with a singular appearance into the
    bargain. He was well made, and had reddish hair which stood up
    on end; his face was homely and covered with freckles, but
    changed and brightened wonderfully when he warmed into
    enthusiasm, which happened often enough.</label> Van Gogh provoked
    laughter repeatedly by his attitude and behavior - for
    everything he did and thought and felt, and his way of living,
    was different from that of others of his age. At table he said
    lengthy prayers and ate like a penitent friar for instance, he
    would not take meat, gravy, etc. And then his face had always
    an abstracted expression - pondering, deeply serious,
    melancholy. But when he laughed, he did so heartily and with
    gusto, and his whole face brightened.</p>

    <p>He was thrifty by nature, and also from necessity, for his
    means were limited like mine - even more so, for he was only a
    novice in business. Besides, he did not want to ask his parents
    to supplement his income (his father was a clergyman at Etten
    and Leur).</p>

    <p>In the evening, when he came home, he used to find me
    studying - at the time I was working for my teaching
    certificate - and then, after an encouraging word to me, he
    would start working, too.</p>

    <p>And his work was not, as one might have expected, art, but
    religion. Night after night Van Gogh sat reading the Bible,
    making extracts from it, and writing sermons; for in those days
    (I presume he was twenty-five then), strict piety was the core
    of his being. Only when we took a walk together did the superb
    views and distant prospects in which Dordrecht is so rich
    occasion him to expatiate upon what seemed beautiful to
    him.</p>

    <p>His religious feelings were broad and noble, the reverse of
    narrow-minded; although in those days he was an orthodox
    Protestant, he not only went to the Dutch Reformed Church on
    Sunday, but also on the same day to the Jansenist, the Roman
    Catholic and the Lutheran churches. And when I once expressed
    my astonishment and lack of understanding, he answered with a
    good-natured smile, &ldquo;Do you really think, G., that God
    cannot be found in the other churches?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He lived like a kind of ascetic, and permitted him self only
    one luxury - a pipe. Cigars were too expensive, and, for that
    matter, he liked to smoke pipe tobacco and in large
    quantities.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">Gradually he got more melancholy, and his daily work cost
    him more and more effort; he was not fit for his job, and his
    job was not fit for him.</label> In the midst of his bookkeeping a
    beautiful text or a pious thought would occur to him, and he
    would write it down; he could not resist the impulse, ce fut
    plus fort que lui. And when he had to give ladies and other
    customers information about the prints, exhibited by Mr. Braat,
    he paid no attention to his employer's interests, but said
    explicitly and unreservedly what he thought of their artistic
    value. Once more: he was unfit for business. To be a minister
    of religion, that was his ideal, and it was an obsession with
    him; but he condemned, or at least did not approve of, the
    necessity of a knowledge of Latin and Greek for the
    ministry.</p>

    <p>So religion occupied all his spare time and thoughts - not
    art; though what he had to say about art now and then was
    sound, instructive and to the point. Religion had also inspired
    him when he was in London acting as a curate to an old
    preacher, who endeavored to educate neglected boys and worse.
    About this he would tell quite poignant stories.</p>

    <p>So he struggled on, deluding his parents into thinking he
    was contented. But when, in consequence of an application, I
    once stayed with his parents, I frankly told Mrs. Van Gogh what
    was wrong with him, and that V. was unhappy in his profession,
    though his employer was a kind sort of man; and that he had
    only one ardent desire, to become a preacher. I told him what I
    had done, and he said, &ldquo;I regret this, but it is
    true.&rdquo; His parents then forced him to tell the truth
    unreservedly, and he went to Amsterdam, to his uncle Van Gogh,
    the rear admiral. But we who knew his sober and simple ways
    realized he would feel extremely lonely there. His stay did not
    last long, which was to be expected.</p>

    <p>When he took leave of me, he gave me as a keepsake
    <i>L'oiseau</i> by Michelet, a book he passionately admired. At
    the time Spurgeon too was one of his favorite authors. Mr.
    Rijken and his wife were very kind to him, for they held his
    earnestness and gentleness in high esteem....</p>

    <p>&hellip; However, this modest investigation into Vincent van
    Gogh's stay in Dordrecht left a number of questions
    unanswered. And the more I heard about it, the more I was
    captivated by the subject.</p>

    <p>Therefore I wrote to Mrs. Van Gogh, Theo's widow, asking
    whether there were any letters pertaining to the Dordrecht
    episode which might shed more light on this period of Vincent's
    life. Part of Mrs. Van Gogh's reply follows:</p>

    <p>I should take the greatest of pleasure in letting you
    examine the Dordrecht letters, but I have not got here ... the
    proofs of the first volume&hellip; But the book may be
    published any day now....</p>

    <p>The letters written at that time are excellent. He tells
    about living with Rijken the corn chandler, and about Nico
    Mager, and a certain G&ouml;rlitz, a teacher. I still
    have a letter about Theo from Mr. Braat, the father; Theo had
    been an intimate friend of Frans Braat's in Paris.... The
    letters impart so much.... I have been working on them for
    years. The last two years I have been doing nothing else, often
    working on far into the night.</p>

    <p>Out of his 652 letters, jumbled together in utter confusion,
    with loose sheets, and hardly ever dated...</p>

    <p>And how many family letters have I not hunted through in
