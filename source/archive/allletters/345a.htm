    <p>Letter 345a<br>
     Nuenen, c. 7-8 December 1883</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is still early; I want to add a few words to yesterday's
    letter in order to try and make some things clearer to you. But
    I beg you to consider what I say in this letter something I
    should be silent about if I did not think I can always count on
    your discretion and intelligence.</p>

    <p>I have not said a single word to Father and Mother about the
    <i>real difficulty</i> of two years ago. However, I did mention
    a matter of <i>secondary</i> importance - on their part Father
    and Mother do not even mention <i>her</i>, all right.
    <i>They</i> need not speak to <i>me</i> about it, neither need
    <i>I</i> to <i>them</i>. Indirectly, however, I touched upon
    the matter; I told Father and Mother that in my opinion it was
    seriously wrong that at a certain moment, two years ago, I was
    forced to leave the house. I said that for me this not only
    brought about considerable financial trouble, but also that it
    drove me to extremes, and that I was forced into a much more
    stubborn attitude than I should have adopted of my own free
    will.</p>

    <p>By way of example I pointed out the contrast between the
    behaviour of the Van Rappard family and that of the Van Gogh
    family. I pointed out that at times Van Rappard also has a
    difference of opinion with his father about this or that, but
    that they always avoid extremes, not only for the world's
    benefit but also for their own sakes, and that Rappard, though
    he does not earn a cent from his work (which for all that is
    very sound and even very beautiful), can always face the world
    in a dignified manner, also as regards his outfit and studio
    and such things. And that the family always sees to it that
    there is no money owing to the colour dealers, and so on. I
    told Father how noble, how manly, how just I considered it of
    you, Theo, always to have come to my aid to the utmost of your
    powers. I pointed out that if Father had been less iron-like
    and obstinate at the time - in short, less unintelligent - your
    help would have been efficacious, whereas now your help is not
    efficacious, and we have only half succeeded.</p>

    <p>To this extent I certainly did touch upon the past. At the
    same time I pointed out that at present it is again difficult
    for me to avoid extremes, as the terms I feel I am on with the
    family are so bad that it becomes clear to me that the tie
    between you and me cannot last if matters are forever being
    left as they are.</p>

    <p>That on thinking it over, whether I do right or wrong in
    accepting money from you, I must take how it looks into
    consideration.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">I tell you frankly that more and more I think the spirit
    prevailing in our family, especially in Father, and for
    instance in C.M. is wrong.</label></p>

    <p>With regard to you my position is like this:</p>

    <p>On the one hand I believe there is yet a possibility of your
    character, like mine, repudiating many things we have been
    taught - aye, I say it is possible that a revulsion of feeling
    will come about in your mind, either gradually or suddenly, and
    that this will force you to adopt a new conception of life,
    which perhaps will finally result in your becoming a
    painter.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, in sharp contrast to this, there is, for
    instance, your saying last summer, &ldquo;I am getting more and
    more like Father.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If this were true - that is to say, if you were to become
    more and more a &ldquo;Van Gogh,&rdquo; a character like Father
    or C.M. and if by always being in business you should acquire a
    conception of life entirely different from mine - namely a
    commercial spirit - more or less a political personality -
    well, putting it bluntly, in this case I should prefer to have
    no intimate relations with you; then, instead of strengthening
    the ties between us, I would rather part company, both
    understanding that we are not well matched.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.father">At the moment I am right under Father's nose - I see, I
    hear, I feel what Father is, and I do not approve of it,
    decidedly not - if you are like that and getting more and more
    like it, then it would be wise to part company.</label></p>

    <p>Now to revert to the fact that I told Father it was wrong
    that two years ago we quarreled so violently that I was locked
    out of the house afterward (it does not matter so much whose
    fault it was - it would have been according to Father's own
    principles - if he had been consistent - to avoid this quarrel
    at all costs). And what does Father say to this? - Yes, but I
    cannot take back anything of what I did then; what I have done
    I have always done for your own good, and I have always
    followed my sincere conviction. To this I replied that it may
    happen that a person's conviction is completely at variance
    with <i>conscience</i>; I mean, <i>what one thinks one should
    do</i> may be diametrically opposed to <i>what one ought to
    do</i>.</p>

    <p>I told Father that in the Bible itself maxims can be found
    by which we may test our &ldquo;convictions,&rdquo; to see
    whether they are reasonable and just.</p>

    <p>And that Father was too much in the habit of omitting to do
    so, and of flying into a violent passion, in my opinion very
    unjustly and very arbitrarily - very reprehensibly - not as
    regards his &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; but as regards his
    conscience.</p>

    <p>Enough, so I was standing before a barrier of implacability
    indeed - although Father tried to divert my reasoning and to
    confuse the issue, and to prevent my pursuing the subject. But
    I did not allow myself to be diverted, and I said, &ldquo;Pa,
    here I am faced by your self-righteousness, which was and is
    fatal, for you as well as for me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then Father said, "Do you expect me to kneel before
    you?"</p>

    <p>And then I said that I took this very ill of Father, and
    that I thought it coarse of Father only to look at it that way,
    and that I should not waste my breath on the subject any
    longer.</p>

    <p>There is no need for Father to say that he committed an
    error in my case, but Father should have learned what <i>I</i>
    learned in these two years - that it was an error in itself,
    and that it should be rectified immediately, without raising
    the question of whose fault it was.</p>

    <p>Look, brother, in my opinion Father is forever lapsing into
    <i>narrow</i>-mindedness, instead of being bigger, more
    liberal, broader and more humane. It was clergyman's vanity
    that carried things to extremes at the time; and it is still
    that same clergyman's vanity that will cause more disasters now
    and in the future.</p>

    <p>I do not beg for your mediation, I do not beg for anything
    personal on your part; but I ask you point-blank how we stand -
    are you a &ldquo;Van Gogh&rdquo; too? I have always looked upon
    you as &ldquo;Theo.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In character I am rather different from the various members
    of the family, and essentially I am <i>not</i> a &ldquo;Van
    Gogh.&rdquo; If you become a &ldquo;personality&rdquo; - if you
    were going to play a part in the world - like Father or C.M. or
    even V. - all right, I should not try to interfere, I should
    take you at your own valuation. I should be silent about it;
    but our ways would diverge so much that I should not think it
    advisable to continue our financial relations. I hope you will
    understand what I want to express. If not, you'll have to give
    it time.</p>

    <p>Who knows whether in the course of the next three years you
    will not come to look upon certain questions the way I do. Why?
    Because you will be influenced by art and intercourse with
    artists, and, in short, in consequence you will get to be
    bigger and broader instead of smaller and narrower. Well, old
    fellow, try to help me get away from here if you can. Kind
    regards and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
