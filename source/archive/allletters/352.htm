    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>I just have to tell you something that has happened.</p>

    <p>Something has happened to Mother.</p>

    <p>On getting off the train at Helmond, Mother hurt her
    leg.</p>

    <p>Father says the doctor told him it was undoubtedly a
    fracture of the thighbone, near the pelvis and the hip
    joint.</p>

    <p>I was present at the setting, which came off comparatively
    well, so that I am almost inclined to think it more a
    dislocation.</p>

    <p>The doctor assures us there is no real danger, but
    considering Mother's age, it will take a long time.</p>

    <p>I wanted to tell you the exact truth, supposing that you
    would prefer that. But I give you my word of honour that it is
    not worse than I tell you. For the present I will let you hear
    every day. By the same mail I am writing to your address Rue de
    Laval, so that you may hear it as soon as possible, either at
    home or at your office. Tomorrow I shall write again as soon as
    the doctor has been here. It is a great misfortune indeed.</p>

    <p>I was painting at the farm when they sent for me.</p>

    <p>Mother is resting quietly now. Goodbye, boy. With a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
  </body>
