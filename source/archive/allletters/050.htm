    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have not again written to you since we saw each other.
    Meanwhile something happened to me that was not entirely
    unforeseen.</p>

    <p>When I saw Mr. Boussod again, I asked him His Excellence if
    he approved of my being employed in the house for another year,
    and told His Excellence that I hoped that he had nothing
    serious to reproach me with?</p>

    <p>But, alas, it was the case, and His Excellence has forced
    me, as it were, to say that I would leave on 1<sup>st</sup>.
    April, after having thanked the gentlemen for all that I might
    have learned with them.</p>

    <p>When the apple is ripe, a soft breeze will make it fall from
    the tree, and such was the case here. I have probably done
    things that in a certain sense have been very wrong, this is
    why I have never made a big thing to answer back.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.apprehension">Well, my boy, I am not at all clear what I should do next,
    but we shall try to maintain hope and courage.</label></p>

    <p>Oblige me by showing this to Mr. Tersteeg, His Excellence
    may know what has happened, but I believe that it is better if
    you do not tell it to anyone else; and to act as if nothing has
    happened. Write to me soon and believe me</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
