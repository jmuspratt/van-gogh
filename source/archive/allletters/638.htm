  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have been wanting to write you in a quiet moment for several
    days already, but I've been absorbed in my work. This morning
    your letter arrived, for which I thank you, and for the 50-fr.
    note it contained. Yes, I think that for many reasons it would
    be good if we could all be together again for a week of your
    holidays, if longer is impossible. I often think of you, Jo,
    and the little one, and I notice that the children here in the
    healthy open air look well. And yet even here it is difficult
    enough to bring them up, therefore it must be all the more
    terrifying at times to keep them safe and sound in Paris on a
    fourth floor. But after all, we must take things as they come.
    M. Gachet says that a father and mother must naturally feed
    themselves up, he talks of taking 2 liters of beer a day, etc.,
    in those quantities. But you will certainly enjoy furthering
    your acquaintance with him, and he already counts on all of you
    coming, and talks about it every time I see him. He certainly
    seems to me as ill and dazed as you or me, and he is older
    and lost his wife a few years ago, but he is very much the
    doctor, and his profession and faith still sustain him. We are
    great friends already, and as it happens, he already knew Brias
    of Montpellier and has the same idea of him that I have, that
    there you have someone important in the history of modern
    art.</p>

    <p>I am working on <art id=0753>his portrait, the head with a white cap,
    very fair, very light, the hands also a light flesh tint, a
    blue frock coat and a cobalt blue background, leaning on a red
    table, on which are a yellow book and a foxglove plant with
    purple flowers</art>. It is in the same sentiment as
    the self-portrait I did when I left for this place.</p>

    <p>M. Gachet is absolutely <i>fanatical</i> about <art id=0627>this portrait</art>,
    and wants me to do one of him, if I can, exactly like it, which I should like to myself.
    He has now managed to understand <art id=0541>the last portrait of the
    Arl&eacute;sienne</art>, of which you have <art id=0542>one in pink</art>; he
    always comes back to these two portraits when he comes to see
    the studies, and he accepts them completely, but completely,
    as they are.</p>

    <p>I hope to send you a portrait of him soon. Then I have
    painted two studies at his house, which I gave him last week,
    <art id=0755>an aloe with marigolds and cypresses</art>, then
    last Sunday <art id=0756>some white roses, vines and a white figure in it</art>.</p>

    <p>I shall most probably also do the portrait of his daughter,
    who is 19 years old, and with whom I can easily imagine Jo would
    quickly become friends.</p>

    <p>Then I am looking forward to doing the portraits of all of
    you in the open air; yours, one of Jo and one of the little one.</p>

    <p>I have not yet found anything interesting in the way of a
    possible studio, and yet we shall have to take a room to put
    the canvases in which are taking up too much of Tanguy's or
    your place. For I must still touch them up a lot. But anyway I
    am living from day to day - the weather is so beautiful. And I
    am well. I go to bed at 9 o'clock, but get up at 5 most
    of the time. <label content="health.general">I hope that it will not be unpleasant to meet
    myself again after a long absence. And I also hope that this
    feeling I have of being much more master of my brush than
    before I went to Arles will last. And M. Gachet says that he
    thinks it most unlikely that it will return, and that things
    are going quite well.</label></p>

    <p>But he also complains bitterly of the state of things
    everywhere in the villages where he has gone as a total
    stranger, that living there gets so horribly expensive. He says
    he is amazed that the people I lodge with can give me board and
    feed me for that amount, and that compared with others who have
    been here and whom he has known I am even comparatively lucky.
    And that if you come with Jo and the little one, you could not
    do better than stay at this same inn. Now nothing, absolutely
    nothing, is keeping us here but Gachet - but he will remain a
    friend, I should think. I feel that I can do not too bad a
    painting every time I go to his house, and he will continue to
    ask me to dinner every Sunday or Monday.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.diet">But till now, while it is pleasant to
    do a painting there,
    it is rather a burden for me to dine and lunch there, for the
    good soul takes the trouble to have 4 or 5 course
    dinners, which is as dreadful for him as for me - for he
    certainly hasn't a strong stomach. The thing that has
    somewhat prevented me from protesting against it is that it
    recalls the old times for him, when there were those family
    dinners which we ourselves know so well. But the modern idea of
    eating one - or at most two - courses is certainly progress, as
    well as a return to real antiquity.</label> Altogether father
    Gachet is very, yes very like you and me. I read with pleasure
    in your letter that M. Peyron asked for news of me when he
    wrote you. I am going to write him this very evening that all
    is well, for he was very good to me and I shall certainly not
    forget him.</p>

    <p>Desmoulins, the man who has some Japanese pictures at the
    Champ de Mars, has come back here and I hope to meet him.</p>

    <p>What did Gauguin say of the last portrait of the
    Arl&eacute;sienne, which is done after his drawing? You
    will see in the end, I think, that this is one of the least bad
    things I have done. Gachet has a Guillaumin, a nude woman on a
    bed, that I think very beautiful; he also has a very old
    self-portrait by Guillaumin, very different from ours, dark but
    interesting.</p>

    <p>But you will see that his house is full, full like an
    antique dealer's, of things that are not always interesting.
    But nevertheless there is this advantage, there is always
    something for arranging flowers in or for a still life. I did
    these studies for him to show him that if it is not a case for
    which he is paid in money, we will still compensate him for
    what he does for us.</p>

    <p>Do you know the etching by Bracquemond, the Count's
    portrait? It is a masterpiece.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">I shall need as soon as possible 12 tubes zinc white
    from Tasset and 2 medium tubes geranium lake.</label></p>

    <p>Then as soon as you can send them, I am terribly anxious to
    copy once more all the charcoal studies by Bargue, you know,
    the nude figures. I can draw the 60 sheets comparatively
    quickly, say within a month, so you might send a copy on
    approval; I will be sure not to stain or soil it. If I neglect
    to study proportion and the nude again, I shall be badly
    muddled later on. Don't think this absurd or useless.</p>

    <p>Gachet also told me, that if I wished to give him great
    pleasure, he would like me to do again <art id=0630>the &ldquo;Pieta&rdquo;
    by Delacroix</art> for him, he looked at it for a
    long time. In the future he will probably lend me a hand in
    getting models; I feel that he understands us perfectly and
    that he will work with you and me to the best of his power,
    without any reserve, for the love of art for art's sake. And he
    will perhaps get me portraits to do. <label content="business.selling">Now in order to get
    some clients for portraits, one must be able to show different
    ones that one has done. That is the only possibility I see of
    selling anything. Yet notwithstanding everything, some canvases
    will find purchasers someday.</label> Only I think that all the babble
    that has been started on account of the high prices paid for
    Millets, etc., lately has made the chances of merely getting
    back one's painting expenses even worse. It is enough to make
    you dizzy. So why think about it? - it would exhaust us.
    Better perhaps to seek a little friendship and to live
    from day to day.</p>

    <p>I hope that the little one continues well and you two the
    same. Till I see you again, goodbye for now. A good
    handshake</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
