    <p>Thursday</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="health.venereal">It is now the evening before I go back to hospital again,
    and I don't know what they are going to tell me there - perhaps
    I'll only be in for a short while, perhaps they'll bring out
    their probes again and I'll have to keep to my bed for
    days.</label></p>

    <p>That's why I am writing once again from home. It is so quiet
    and peaceful here in the studio right now - it is already late
    - but it is stormy and rainy outside - and that makes the calm
    inside even greater.</p>

    <p>How I wish you had been here with me during this quiet hour,
    brother - how much I should have shown you. The studio looks so
    much like the real thing, or so it seems to me, plain
    grey-brown wallpaper, scrubbed floorboards, muslin stretched on
    slats across the windows, everything bright. And, of course,
    the studies on the wall, an easel on either side and a large
    unpainted wooden work-table. The studio gives on to a sort of
    alcove, where the drawing boards, portfolios, boxes, sticks,
    etc. are kept, as well as all the prints. And in the corner a
    cupboard with all the pots and bottles and on top of that all
    my books.</p>

    <p>Then the little living room with a table, a few kitchen
    chairs, an oil stove, a large wicker armchair for the woman in
    the corner by the window overlooking the yard and the meadows
    that you know from the drawing, and next to it a small iron
    cradle with a green cover.</p>

    <p>This last piece of furniture is something I cannot look at
    without emotion - because a man is gripped by a strong and
    powerful emotion when he sits down next to the woman he loves
    with a baby in the cradle beside them. And although it was a
    hospital that she lay and I sat next to her - it is always that
    eternal poetry of Christmas night with the infant in the
    stable, as the old Dutch painters conceived it, and Millet and
    Breton - a light in the darkness, a brightness in the middle of
    a dark night. And so I hung the large etching after Rembrandt
    over it, the two women by the cradle, one of them reading from
    the Bible by candlelight, while the great shadows cast a deep
    chiaroscuro over the whole room.</p>

    <p>I've hung a few other prints there, all of them very
    beautiful, the Christus Consolator by Scheffer, a photograph
    after Boughton, Le semeur and Les b&ecirc;cheurs by Millet, Le
    buisson by Ruysdael, splendid large wood engravings by Herkomer
    and Frank Holl, and Le banc des pauvres by De Groux.</p>

    <p>Now then, in the small kitchen I have only the barest
    necessities, but such that if the woman recovers before me she
    will find all the essentials and be able to get a meal ready in
    10 minutes, in short, such as will show her, when she steps
    into a house which has flowers in the window where she will be
    sitting, that someone has been giving her a great deal of
    thought. And upstairs in the large attic, a big bedstead for
    the two of us and an old one for the child, with all the
    bedding in good order.</p>

    <p>But please don't think I bought all this in one fell swoop.
    We had already started buying a few bits and pieces here and
    there during the winter, although at the time I didn't know how
    things would turn out and where we would finish up. And the
    result is now, thank God, that this little nest is ready for
    her after all her pain.</p>

    <p>How her mother and I have been exerting ourselves these last
    few days, especially her. And the most difficult thing was the
    bedding, everything made or altered by ourselves - we bought
    straw, sea-grass, coarse linen, etc., and stuffed the
    mattresses ourselves in the attic. Otherwise it would have been
    too expensive.</p>

    <p>And now, after having paid my old landlord, I still have 40
    guilders left out of what you sent me. True, I have to pay 10
    guilders of that tomorrow to the hospital, but for that I'll
    get food and medical treatment there for 14 days. So that this
    month, although it includes the full cost of moving and
    settling in and Sien's return after her confinement with all
    that entails, the cradle, etc., I shall be able to manage
    without your sending me more than the usual.</p>

    <p>On est s&ucirc;r de p&eacute;rir &agrave; part, on ne sauve
    qu'ensemble [United we stand, divided we fall] - I believe this
    saying to be the truth and I base my life on it, might that be
    a mistake or a miscalculation?</p>

    <p>You see, brother, I think of you a very great deal these
    days, in the first place because everything, all that I have,
    is really yours, my lust for life and my energy, too, for I am
    able to get going now with your help and can feel my capacity
    to work flowing back.</p>

    <p>But I think of you so often for another reason, too. I
    remember that only a short while ago I came back to a house
    that was not a real home - not full of warmth as it is now -
    where two great voids stared at me night and day. There was no
    woman, there was no child, and though I do not believe there
    was any the less grief, I do believe there was less love. And
    those two voids kept me company to left and right, in the
    street, at work, everywhere and always. There was no woman,
    there was no child.</p>

    <p>Look, I don't know if you've ever had that feeling which
    sometimes forces a sort of sigh or groan from one when one is
    alone: oh God, where is my wife, oh God, where is my child - is
    being alone really living? Thinking of you, I'm sure I'm not
    mistaken in supposing that some of this same melancholy is in
    you, too, perhaps less passionately and nerve-wrackingly than
    in me, but nevertheless to some extent and at certain moments.
    And I don't know whether you will approve of it or not, whether
    you will judge it right or wrong of me, when I tell you that
    now and then that is how I think of you.</p>

    <p>This much, however, I believe about you, and this much I
    know about myself, notwithstanding my nervousness, that in both
    our characters there is a foundation of serenity - serenity
    quand bien m&ecirc;me [despite everything], so that neither of
    us is unhappy, our serenity being based on the fact that we
    truly and sincerely love our trade and our work, and that art
    occupies a large part of our thoughts and makes life
    interesting. So I most certainly do not want to make you
    melancholy, but only to explain my conduct and philosophy of
    life by dint of something in your own temperament.</p>

    <p>And that brings me to Father - do you think Father would go
    on being cold and finding fault - beside a cradle? You see, a
    cradle is not like anything else - there is no trickery about
    it.<label content="feelings.love"> And no matter what Sien's past may have been, I know no
    other Sien than the one from last winter, than that mother in
    the hospital whose hand pressed mine as we looked with tears in
    our eyes at the baby for whom we had both been toiling all
    winter.</label></p>

    <p>And look here - entre nous, soit dit [just between us] -
    without sermonizing - if there is no God, there is nevertheless
    one very close by somewhere, and one feels His presence at
    moments like this. Which is tantamount to saying something for
    which I would happily substitute the straightforward statement:
    I believe in a God, and that it is His will that man does not
    live alone but with a wife and child, if everything is to be
    normal.</p>

    <p>And it is my hope that you will understand the way I have
    behaved and take it for what it is, namely natural, and that
    you will not think of it as tricking me or being tricked. And,
    my dear fellow, when you do come - and if you can, come soon to
    have a look - then please take Sien, just as I do, for a mother
    and an ordinary housewife and for nothing else. For that is
    what she really is and in my opinion all the better for having
    known le revers de la medaille [the other side of the
    coin].</p>

    <p>The last thing I did was to get a few plates, forks, spoons
    and knives - for neither Sien nor I had any until now. I
    thought, 3 people, so 3 sets, but then I had another thought -
    an extra set for Theo or for Father when they come and have a
    look. So your little spot by the window and your place at our
    table are ready and waiting for you &hellip; So, I only want to
    say - you are definitely coming, aren't you&hellip;and Father
    as well?</p>

    <p>I thought it sensible and tactful of you not to have spoken
    about it to Father and Mother as yet - now the confinement is
    over and the flowers are out again - and it was better for
    Father and Mother not to be mixed up in it before now. I mean,
    I thought it best to keep the thorns to myself and to let
    Father and Mother see nothing but the rose. Thus when the woman
    is back and I am better, I should like to talk about it in the
    way I told you, so should they ask you anything now, you could
    well drop a hint. Goodbye, good-night,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
