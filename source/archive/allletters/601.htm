    <p>Letter 601<sup>1</sup><br>
     Saint-R&eacute;my, 22 August 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I thank Jo very much for having written, and know that
    you want me to drop you a line, <label content="health.mental">I must let you know that it is
    very difficult for me to write, my head is so deranged. So I
    am taking advantage of an interval. Dr. Peyron is very kind to
    me and very patient. You can imagine that I am terribly
    distressed because the attacks have come back, when I was
    already beginning to hope that it would not return.</label></p>

    <p>It would be a good thing if you perhaps wrote a word to
    Dr. Peyron to tell him that working on my pictures is almost a
    necessity for my recovery, for these days without anything to
    do, and without being able to go to the room they have allotted
    me to do my painting in, are almost intolerable.</p>

    <p>(Friend Roulin has written me too.)</p>

    <p>I have received a catalogue of the Gauguin, Bernard,
    Schuffenecker, etc., exhibition, which I find interesting.
    G.has also written a kind letter, as always a little vague
    and obscure, but after all I must say that I think they are
    right to have an exhibition among themselves.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">For many days I  have been <i>absolutely wandering</i>,
    as in Arles, quite as much if not worse, and presumably the
    attacks will come back again in the future, it is
    <i>abominable</i>.</label></p>

    <p><label content="health.general">For 4 days I was unable to eat because of a swollen
    throat.</label></p>

    <p>I hope it is not complaining too much if I tell you these
    details, but I do it to prove that I am not yet in a
    condition to go to Paris or to Pont-Aven, unless it were to
    Charenton. It seems that I gather dirt and eat it, although
    my memory of these bad moments are vague, and it seems to me
    there is something shady in it.For this reason I don't know
    what it will mean for my painting.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">I no longer see any possibility of having courage or
    hope, but after all, it wasn't just yesterday that we found
    this job of ours wasn't a cheerful one.</label></p>

    <p>All the same I am pleased that you have got the package from
    here: the landscapes. Thank you especially for this etching
    after Rembrandt. <sup>2</sup> It is amazing, and yet it reminds
    me once more of the man with the staff in the Lacaze Gallery.</p>

    <p>If you want to give me very, very great pleasure, then send a
    copy to Gauguin. Further, the brochure on Rodin and Claude
    Monet is very interesting.</p>

    <p>This new attack, my dear brother, took me in the fields, on a
    windy day, when I was painting. I will send you <art id=0744>the
    canvas, which I nevertheless finished</art>.</p>

    <p>And truly it was a more sober attempt, mat in colour without
    showing it, in broken greens, and reds and rusty yellow ochre,
    just as I told you that sometimes I felt a great desire to
    begin again with a palette as of the North. I'll send you this
    canvas as soon as I can.</p>

    <p> Good days, thank you for all your kindness. A good handshake
    to you and Jo, and naturally to Cor if he is still there.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>[Written in the margins] </p>

    <p>Mother and Wil also wrote me a very nice letter.</p>

    <p>While I have no extravagant liking for Rod's book, all the
    same I have made <art id=0622>a canvas of the passage where he speaks of the
    mountains and the dark huts</art>.</p>
