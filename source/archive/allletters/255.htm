  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Before the year is up, I feel I have to thank you again for
    all your help and friendship.</p>

    <p>I haven't sent you anything for a long time, but I am saving
    up for the time when you will come here.</p>

    <p>I am sorry that I haven't succeeded in making a saleable
    drawing this year. I really do not know where the fault
    lies.</p>

    <p>I wish you could come to the studio sometime. I think I
    wrote you in my last letter that I am at present drawing large
    heads because I felt the need of a more intimate study of the
    structure of the skull and the interpretation of the
    physiognomy. The work absorbs me greatly, and I found a few
    things lately for which I had been seeking for a long time.
    Well, whenever you come, you will see everything.</p>

    <p><label content="health.dental">These days I am troubled with a bad toothache which
    sometimes affects my right eye and ear; however, it may be
    partly due to nerves. If one has toothache, one becomes
    indifferent to many things, but it is curious that, for
    instance, Daumier's drawings are so true that they almost make
    one forget the toothache. </label>I have two new prints of his,
    &ldquo;Un Train de Plaisir&rdquo; [Excursion Train], travellers
    with pale faces and black coats in rough weather arriving on
    the platform too late, among them women with crying babies.</p>

    <p>Do you know the little book Croquis &agrave; la Plume
    [Pen-and-ink Drawings], written by the draughtsman Henri
    Monnier (who created Mr. Prudhomme)? In it I read the
    &ldquo;Journey by Coach,&rdquo; amazingly real.</p>

    <p>I suppose you are still busy with your inventory, and I will
    not keep you from your work.</p>

    <p>My very best wishes for a Happy New Year.</p>

    <p>In the New Year shall I succeed better in making saleable
    drawings? or in getting some work from an illustrated paper? Of
    one thing I am sure, wrestling with nature is no idle work, and
    though I do not know what the result will be, there must be
    some result.</p>

    <p>I wish you could come to the studio again - not because I
    can't go on or don't know what to do, but mainly because I am
    so afraid you will think I am not making progress. And though I
    cannot show you any definite result, you would see that it is
    slowly developing, and you would see that I am aiming high.</p>

    <p>I perfectly agree with what you wrote recently, &ldquo;There
    comes a time when one has mastered drawing so well that the
    size makes no difference and one knows the proportions by
    heart, so that one can work as well on a large as on a small
    scale.&rdquo; Not only do I absolutely agree with you in this,
    but, besides that, I believe that one must, and can, work till
    one is master of composition and the effects of light and
    shadow, so that in the sphere one has chosen, one can conquer
    the most diverse subjects: for instance, draw a first-class
    waiting room today, a rainy day in a poor quarter tomorrow,
    another time a workhouse, then again a saloon or a soup
    kitchen. I am not yet that far - but perhaps it takes a long
    time just because I look for the common root or origin of so
    many things.</p>

    <p>Thanks for all your faithful friendship, boy, which has
    again upheld me for a whole year. I wish that for my part I
    could give you some pleasure, too. <i>Sometime I shall succeed
    in this</i>.</p>

    <p>A handshake in thought. Write me again if you have a moment.
    Once more best wishes.</p>

    <p>Believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
