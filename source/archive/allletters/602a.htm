  <body>
    <p>Dear Sir,</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I add a few words to your brother's letter to inform you
    that he has quite recovered from his crisis, that he has
    completely regained his lucidity of mind, and that he has
    resumed painting just as he used to do. His thoughts of suicide
    have disappeared,</label><label content="psychology.nightmares"> only disturbing dreams remain,
    but they tend to disappear too, and their intensity is less great.</label></p>

    <p>His appetite has returned, and he has resumed his usual mode
    of life.</p>

    <p>With my best compliments,</p>

    <p>Yours Faithfully, Dr. Peyron</p>
