  <body>
    <p>Dear Mother,</p>

    <p>When you say you are a mother nearly seventy years old, it
    must be true, but one would not notice it from your
    handwriting, for it struck me as being very firm. Also Theo and
    Wil wrote me that you seem to be getting young again, and I
    think this is very good, and is sometimes necessary in life.
    The news about Cor - no wonder that you are preoccupied with
    it, and it will be hard for both sides to have to separate. He
    is right though, I think, not to hesitate to accept this
    position, as it seems that one can get on better and be happier
    in the world by being at a distance from these big cities, not
    only Paris, but Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and so many others in
    Europe. There is more that is natural and good in the world
    than one would suppose here in our continent.</p>

    <p>I have often heard talk, not exactly about the Transvaal,
    but for instance about Australia, by people who came from there
    and were always longing to go back. Also about Haiti, for
    instance, and Martinique, where Gauguin, who stayed with me in
    Arles, has been. And I suppose that the Transvaal will have
    several things in common with Australia. One has the chance to
    develop oneself better there and to use one's energy better
    than in this European circumlocution.</p>

    <p>As far as the sorrow, dear Mother, is concerned, which we
    have and continue to have in separation and loss, it seems to
    me it is instinctive, that without that we could not resign
    ourselves to separations, and that probably it will help us to
    recognize and find each other again later. It seems impossible
    for things to remain in their place.</p>

    <p>And yet apples do not fall far away from the tree, nor will
    stinging nettles grow from their pips. Beyond that I know
    nothing. <label content="Theo.health">I have good news from Theo and Jo; yet I am not
    surprised that he is coughing, etc. Sometimes I have wished
    that they lived outside Paris, and not on a fourth or fifth
    floor, etc., and yet I should not want to take the
    responsibility of urging him to change, because Theo needs
    action, business and friends in Paris itself. Let his wife take
    care that he gets back to his old Dutch food as much as
    possible, for he has been deprived of this for about ten years,
    and has been fed with restaurant food without any family life.</label>
    I have every hope that she will understand this, and perhaps
    has understood it already.</p>

    <p>The main thing is perhaps this: do you remember the story in
    that book De Pruuvers <sup>1</sup>, in which there was the tale
    of someone who was ill, who used to look every morning at the
    maid who was sweeping the floor and think that she had
    &ldquo;something reassuring&rdquo; about her.</p>

    <p>This is the main thing to which, in the most different and
    the most divergent cases of sickness, recovery can largely be
    attributed. Therefore I should, cruel as it may seem, leave the
    anxiety about the strength of Theo's constitution to her, and
    let her worry and struggle for a year before we have to be
    concerned about him. And it seems to me, if we do not worry
    about it, this is a sign of our own confidence, and of
    &ldquo;something reassuring&rdquo; in nature in general.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that it is not much warmer here in summer
    than at home, as far as being oppressed by it is concerned, as
    the air is much clearer and purer here. Further, we very often
    have a strong wind, the &ldquo;mistral.&rdquo; I have been
    painting in the wheat fields during the hottest part of the
    day, without being unduly troubled by it.</p>

    <p>But sometimes one notices that the sun is rather powerful,
    as the grain gets yellow very soon, but the fields with us are
    cultivated more intensely and more regularly than here, where
    in many places the rocky soil is not fit for everything. Here
    there are very beautiful fields with olive trees, which are
    silvery grey in leaf, like pollard willows.</p>

    <p>Then I never get tired of the blue sky. One never sees
    buckwheat or rape here, and perhaps there is in general less
    variety than with us. And I should so much like to paint a
    buckwheat field in flower, or the rape in bloom, or flax, but
    maybe I will have an opportunity for this later on in Normandy
    or Brittany. Also, here one never sees those moss-covered roofs
    on the barns or cottages as at home, nor the oak coppices, nor
    spurry, nor beech hedges with their white tangled old stems.
    Nor the real heather, nor the birches which were so beautiful
    in Nuenen. But what is beautiful in the South are the
    vineyards, but they are in the flat country or on the
    hillsides. I have seen some, and even sent a picture of them to
    Theo, in which <art id=0495>a vineyard was quite purple,
    fire-red, and yellow and green and violet, like the Virginia
    creeper in Holland.</art> I like to see a vineyard as much as a wheat
    field. Besides, the hills full of thyme and other aromatic
    plants are very nice here, and because of the clearness of the
    air, from the heights one can see so much farther here than at
    home.</p>

    <p>Now I close by saying that I believe you will be glad that
    your son Theo has at last got married. If I were you, I should
    not worry about his health, but in your place I should take
    care to make an arrangement with him that he and his wife come
    to visit you twice a year instead of once. This would be good
    for you and for them, especially when Cor goes away. As far as
    his business is concerned, it will do him no harm to get some
    other thoughts, and as far as his wife is concerned, you may be
    sure that she will not blame you if you stimulate his desire to
    go to Holland with her from time to time. Don't forget that we
    have as much reason for unthankfulness as for thankfulness
    toward the Paris business, and you in your quality of a mother
    of nearly seventy may take this into account.</p>

    <p>I embrace you in thought and with a handshake for Cor I wish
    him courage in his enterprise.</p>

    <p>Believe me always,</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
