    <p>[Letter written in English by Vincent van Gogh to the
    English painter Horace M. Livens, whom he had met in Antwerp.
    The text is reproduced without alterations.]</p>

    <p>Paris, Aug-Oct. 1887</p>

    <p>My dear Mr. Levens,</p>

    <p>Since I am here in Paris I have very often thought of
    yourself and work. You will remember that I liked your colour,
    your ideas on art and literature and I add, most of all your
    personality. I have already before now thought that I ought to
    let you know what I was doing, where I was. But what refrained
    me was that I find living in Paris is much dearer than in
    Antwerp and not knowing what your circumstances are I dare not
    say, come over to Paris from Antwerp without warning you that
    it costs one dearer, and that if poor, one has to suffer many
    things - as you may imagine - . But on the other hand there is
    more chance of selling. There is also a good chance of
    exchanging pictures with other artists. In one word, with much
    energy, with a sincere personal feeling of colour in nature I
    would say an artist can get on here notwithstanding the many
    obstructions. And I intend remaining here still longer.</p>

    <p>There is much to be seen here - for instance Delacroix, to
    name only one master. In Antwerp I did not even know what the
    impressionists were, now I have seen them and though <i>not</i>
    being one of the club yet I have much admired certain
    impressionists' pictures - <i>Degas</i> nude figure - <i>Claude
    Monet</i> landscape.</p>

    <p>And now for what regards what I myself have been doing, I
    have lacked money for paying models else I had entirely given
    myself to figure painting. But I have made a series of colour
    studies in painting, simply flowers, red poppies, blue corn
    flowers and myosotys, white and rose roses, yellow
    chrysanthemums-seeking oppositions of blue with orange, red and
    green, yellow and violet seeking <i>les tons rompus et
    neutres</i> to harmonize brutal extremes. Trying to render
    intense colour and not a grey harmony. Now alter these
    gymnastics I lately did two heads which I dare say are better
    in light and colour than those I did before.</p>

    <p>So as we said at the time: in <i>colour</i> seeking
    <i>life</i> the true drawing is modelling with colour.</p>

    <p>I did a dozen landscapes too, frankly <i>green</i> frankly
    <i>blue</i>.</p>

    <p>And so I am struggling for life and progress in art.</p>

    <p>Now I would very much like to know what you are doing and
    whether you ever think of going to Paris.</p>

    <p>If ever you did come here, write to me before and I will, if
    you like, share my lodgings and studio with you so long as I
    have any. In spring - say February or even sooner I may be
    going to the South of France, the land of the <i>blue</i> tones
    and gay colours.</p>

    <p>And look here, if I knew you had longings for the same we
    might combine.</p>

    <p>I felt sure at the time that you are a thorough colourist
    and since I saw the impressionists I assure you that neither
    your colour nor mine as it is developping itself, is
    <i>exactly</i> the same as their theories. But so much dare I
    say we have a chance and a good one finding friends. I hope
    your health is all-right. I was rather low down in health when
    in Antwerp but got better here.</p>

    <p>Write to me in any case. Remember me to Allen, Briet, Rink,
    Durant but I have not often thought of them as I did think of
    you - almost daily.</p>

    <p>Shaking hands cordially. Yours truly Vincent</p>

    <p>My present address is</p>

    <p>Mr. Vincent van Gogh</p>

    <p>54 Rue Lepic, Paris.</p>

    <p>With regard my chances of sale look here, they are certainly
    not much but still <i>I do have</i> a beginning.</p>

    <p>At the present moment I have found four dealers who have
    exhibited studies of mine. And I have exchanged studies with
    many artists.</p>

    <p>Now the prices are 50 francs. Certainly not much - but - as
    far as I can see one must sell cheap to rise and even at
    costing price. And mind my dear fellow, Paris is Paris. There
    is but one Paris and however hard living may be here, and if it
    became worse and harder even - the french air clears up the
    brain and does good - a world of good. I have been in Cormons
    studio for three or four months but I did not find that so
    useful as I had expected it to be. It may be my fault however,
    anyhow I left there too as I left Antwerp and since I worked
    alone, and fancy that since I feel my own self more.</p>

    <p>Trade is slow here. The great dealers sell Millet,
    Delacroix, Corot, Daubigny, Dupr&eacute;, a few other masters
    at exorbitant prices. They do little or nothing for young
    artists. The second class dealers contrariwise sell those at
    very low prices. If I asked more I would do nothing, I fancy.
    However I have faith in colour. Even with regards the price the
    public will pay for it in the long run. But for the present
    things are awfully hard. Therefore let anyone who risks to go
    over here consider there is no laying on roses at all.</p>

    <p>What is to be gained is <i>progress</i> and what the deuce
    that is, it is to be found here. I dare say as certain anyone
    who has a solid position elsewhere let him stay where he is.
    But for adventurers as myself, I think they lose nothing in
    risking more. Especially as in my case I am not an adventurer
    by choice but by fate, and feeling nowhere so much myself a
    stranger as in my family and country. - Kindly remember me to
    your landlady Mrs. Roosmalen and say her that if she will
    exhibit something of my work I will send her a small picture of
    mine.</p>

    <p>[According to John Rewald of New York, this letter was first
    published in the Sunday Times, London, February 17, 1929 (ed.
    F.V. Lucas). Livens painted mainly &ldquo;farmyards." The
    letter was written in 1886 (not 1887).]</p>
