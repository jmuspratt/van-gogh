  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>While waiting for more information on the process, I have,
    with the help of Smulder's printer, made <art id=1658>a lithograph of which
    I have the pleasure of sending you the very first print</art>. I drew
    this lithograph on a piece of prepared paper, probably the same
    as that which Buhot mentioned to you.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">Meanwhile, I long very much to compare the paper of the Vie
    Moderne with that which I bought from Smulders. S.'s is very
    expensive, 1.75 guilders a sheet, but it is pleasant to work
    on.</label></p>

    <p>You see, I scratched this sheet as simply as possible. I
    shall be quite satisfied if there is something in it which
    reminds you of the old lithographs from the period when there
    was in general more enthusiasm for this branch of art than
    there is now.</p>

    <p>I can get a hundred prints for 5 guilders, and for a little
    more the stone becomes my property.</p>

    <p>Is this worth while, do you think? I should love to make
    more of them. For instance, a series of about thirty
    figures.</p>

    <p>But in the matter of printing, I must first know your
    opinion.</p>

    <p>But this is what I should like: if we could show, without a
    third party's intermediary, a series of about thirty pages, not
    too elaborate, but vigorously done, which we had got printed at
    our own expense. This would give us more prestige in the eyes
    of the people whom we shall need later, namely the editors of
    the magazines. But in business matters you see more clearly
    than I, and sometime we shall talk it over together.</p>

    <p>Do try to give me all the information you can about the
    process. On what must one work with autographic ink? Can
    everything be printed that is drawn with autographic ink?
    Etc.</p>

    <p>Here is my model, <art id=979a>a sweeper from the Bezuidenhout
    </art>, so with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>If at all possible, do not send me the money later than the
    tenth, for I have had some extra expenses because of one thing
    and another.</p>

    <p>I want to add a few words to this letter.</p>

    <p>I think Buhot, for instance, will be able to tell you
    something constructive about the technique more clearly with
    this sheet in hand.</p>

    <p>Wouldn't it be great if this proved a success? But for me,
    what is a hundred times more important than the process is the
    drawings themselves. I work with the model as much as my purse
    allows. For you understand one must have ammunition in the form
    of studies once one starts illustrating if one wants to
    continue it for any length of time. And more important things
    will follow from it. So I cannot stress this enough: it is of
    <i>more</i> importance to me to have a supply of drawings on
    hand than to hurry to get employment, though such would be
    quite welcome to me.</p>

    <p>But if they do not readily accept them, well, nothing's
    lost, and I think that later I shall get better results with
    the larger stock of drawings. Also because I shouldn't wonder
    if the need for draughtsmen became more and more manifest.</p>

    <p>I am very sorry that I did not know this process before.
    When I was in Brussels, I tried to find employment with some
    lithographer, but was rebuffed everywhere. I asked there for
    any kind of work, as I only wanted to see something of
    lithography and especially to learn. But they didn't want
    people like that.</p>

    <p>Simmonneau and Fouvey were the least unwilling. They said
    that the young men they had tried to instruct had given them
    little satisfaction, and business was so slack that they had
    enough employees. I went on and mentioned De Groux's and Rop's
    lithographs, but they said, Yes, but such draughtsmen do not
    exist any more. The impression I received there and in other
    establishments was that lithography was definitely dying
    out.</p>

    <p>However, this new invention proves that they are trying to
    revive it.</p>

    <p>What beautiful things have been lithographed - Charlet,
    Raffet, Lemud, besides the others whom we talked about
    recently.</p>

    <p>Last night I looked over the Gavarnis with renewed
    pleasure.</p>

    <p>I hope you see from this specimen that I am very eager to
    try my best to make something.</p>

    <p>I wrote you, didn't I, how I came to make this as a result
    of my telling Smulders what you wrote me about that paper, and
    his saying that he still had some of it in stock?</p>

    <p>He seemed rather astonished when I came back with a drawing
    a few hours after I had bought it.</p>

    <p>Do you want another copy with a wider margin?</p>

    <p>I have just finished drawing two diggers.</p>

    <p>If this size is too large (but I hardly think so, as it is
    rather vigorously drawn) I could - but first I must know how to
    erase something on that paper - reduce them by a half or a
    third without losing accuracy, namely by means of
    quadrangles.</p>

    <p>Well, we'll see about this.</p>

    <p>At the same time you see on this sheet one of the studies
    which I have several of and which I wrote you about.</p>
