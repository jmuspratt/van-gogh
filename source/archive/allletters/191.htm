  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I want to explain somewhat more clearly my answer to your
    line, &ldquo;Tersteeg has been almost like an older brother to
    us, try to stay friends with him.&rdquo; My answer was that he
    might be that to you, but for years I personally have seen only
    his unfriendly and harsh side.</p>

    <p>In all those years, between the time when I left, or got my
    dismissal from Goupil and the time when I began to draw (which
    I acknowledge was a mistake not to have done at once), in those
    years when I was abroad without friends or help, suffering
    great misery (so that in London I often had to sleep in the
    open air, and did so three nights in succession in the
    Borinage), did he ever give me a piece of bread? Did he ever
    encourage me, he who knew me of old, did he ever lend me a
    helping hand when I almost broke down?</p>

    <p>I think not. Did he ever help me in any way? No, except when
    he lent me the Bargues after I had literally implored him four
    times.</p>

    <p>When I sent him my first drawings, he sent me a paintbox but
    not a cent of money. I readily believe those first drawings
    were not worth any money; but, you see, a man like Tersteeg
    might have argued, &ldquo;I know him of old, and I will help
    him get on,&rdquo; and he might have known I needed it so badly
    in order to live.</p>

    <p>When I wrote him from Brussels, &ldquo;Wouldn't it be
    possible for me to work in The Hague awhile and have some
    intercourse with painters?&rdquo; he tried to put me off, and
    wrote, &ldquo;Oh no, certainly not, you have lost your
    rights&rdquo;; I had better give lessons in English and French;
    of one thing he was sure, I was no artist. Or I had better try
    to get <i>copying work</i> from Smeeton and Tilly, though the
    latter was not exactly in my neighbourhood, and besides, in
    Brussels several lithographers had refused me this; there was
    no work, business was slow, was the answer.</p>

    <p>When I showed him drawings again last summer, he said:
    &ldquo;I hadn't expected this.&rdquo; But he didn't <i>help</i>
    me, and didn't take back what he had said before. When I came
    to The Hague after all, without asking his advice, he tried to
    cut me out; I hear he laughed at my becoming a painter.</p>

    <p>I perceived that Mauve thought me a greenhorn, and Mauve was
    quite astonished to find me a different person from what he had
    heard. I did not ask Mauve for money, but of his own accord
    Mauve said, You need money, I will help you earn money, you may
    be sure that now your hard years are over and the sun is rising
    for you - you have worked hard and honestly deserve it. And the
    first thing Mauve did was help me get settled. And then all
    this changed - Mauve's sympathy, which was like water to a
    parched plant to me, ran dry.</p>

    <p>Because Tersteeg poisoned Mauve's ear by saying, &ldquo;Be
    careful, you can't trust him with money. Let him go, don't help
    him any longer; as a dealer I see no good coming of it&rdquo; -
    or at least something like this.</p>

    <p>And when I said to him, Tersteeg, take it easy with that
    slander of yours, he looked astonished, he hadn't said a thing;
    he pretended I had only imagined it. Until one fine day he
    threatened me, &ldquo;Mauve and I will see to it that you don't
    receive any more money from Theo.&rdquo; Then I no longer
    doubted, but realized he was betraying me. Because I knew what
    Mauve had told me about the money I get from you - that it
    would be very good for me to receive it for at least another
    year.</p>

    <p>When you forsake somebody in the winter and then try to take
    his bread away from him, is that <i>forcing</i> a person or
    not?</p>

    <p>It is not considerate, not delicate, it is not good manners,
    it is not humane. And what am I? - only a man who has
    difficult, trying work to do, for which he needs quiet and
    peace and some sympathy; otherwise the work is impossible.</p>

    <p>Theo, think these things over and write me soon. Though I
    felt terribly grieved at Mauve's neglecting me, I have
    struggled through this winter as best I could. But can you
    wonder that it was a shock to me, and that it sometimes seems
    as if my heart would break?</p>

    <p>The likes of Tersteeg &ldquo;laugh&rdquo; at that; but you
    are my brother, and I hope you will not laugh.</p>

    <p>I still have more to tell you about my plans for the future,
    how I intend to carry on my work. But first you must come here,
    and so I won't write about it now, as I hope it will not be so
    very long before you come. You have seen the two drawings I
    sent you. These were not made by accident; I can produce such
    work regularly, and it improves as I go on. So it is not
    unreasonable for me to insist upon its being arranged so that I
    no longer need be afraid that what is strictly necessary will
    be taken from me, nor always feel as if it were the bread of
    charity.</p>

    <p>Bread, clothes, rent, models, and drawing materials are
    strictly necessary. And the way I arrange it, this is not so
    very much, and I can make drawings in return if people will
    only take them. I have no desire to become rich, but of course
    I can't do without those necessary things. A workman is worthy
    of his hire.</p>

    <p>I wish it might be arranged so I could receive the money
    weekly, because it is so hard to reckon a month in advance.</p>

    <p>If Tersteeg takes back the worst of what he has said, I will
    assume he said it unintentionally, and then all will be
    forgiven and forgotten. If he persists, I won't consider him a
    friend, but an enemy who begrudges me the very light of my
    eyes.</p>

    <p>Do not be angry with me, Theo, for troubling you with this.
    But this is the way things have been all winter long, and what
    have I done to deserve all this trouble? <label content="lifestyle.appearance">All the anxiety and
    worry cannot but make me nervous and flurried in speech and
    manner. When Mauve imitated me, saying, &ldquo;This is the sort
    of face you make,&rdquo; &ldquo;This is the way you
    speak,&rdquo; I answered, My dear friend, if you had spent
    rainy nights in the streets of London or cold nights in the
    Borinage - hungry, homeless, feverish - you would also have
    such ugly lines in your face and perhaps a husky voice too.</label></p>

    <p>Adieu, Theo, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>It was impossible to make the views of the city for C. M.
    because of all the rain and wind, so I didn't receive the money
    for them. Therefore, as I have to pay the rent on the first of
    May, if you could send something about that time, it would be
    very welcome.</p>
