    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>The path is narrow, therefore we must be careful. You know
    how others have arrived where we want to go, let us take that
    simple road too.</p>

    <p><i>Ora et Labora</i>, [Pray and work] let us do our
    daily work, whatever the hand finds to do, with all our
    strength and let us believe that God will give good gifts, a
    part that will not be taken away, to those who ask Him for
    it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new
    creature: old things are passed away; behold all things are
    become new!&rdquo; [2 Cor. v.17.]</p>

    <p>I am going to destroy all my books by Michelet, etc. I wish
    you would do the same.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">How I am longing for
    Christmas, but let us have patience, it will come soon enough.</label></p>

    <p>Courage, lad; my compliments to all the friends, and believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>As soon as possible I will send the money for the frames.
    When I write to Mr. Tersteeg, I will tell him that for the
    moment I am rather short of cash; I asked our cashier to hold
    back every month a part of my salary as I shall want a lot of
    money around Christmas for my journey, etc., however I hope to
    send it before long.</p>
  </body>
