  <body>
    <p>My dear Aurier,</p>

    <p>Your absence from Paris means that you have not heard the
    dreadful news which however I am obliged to tell you without
    delay:</p>

    <p>Our dear friend Vincent died four days ago.</p>

    <p>I think that you will have already guessed the fact that he
    killed himself.</p>

    <p>On Sunday evening he went out into the countryside near
    Auvers, placed his easel against a haystack and went behind the
    chateau and fired a revolver shot at himself. Under the
    violence of the impact (the bullet entered his body below the
    heart) he fell, but he got up again, and fell three times more,
    before he got back to the inn where he was staying (Ravoux,
    place de la Mairie) without telling anyone about his injury. He
    finally died on Monday evening, still smoking his pipe which he
    refused to let go of, explaining that his suicide had been
    absolutely deliberate and that he had done it in complete
    lucidity. A typical detail that I was told about his wish to
    die was that when Dr. Gachet told him that he still hoped to
    save his life, he said, &ldquo;Then I'll have to do it over
    again.&rdquo; But, alas, it was no longer possible to save
    him&hellip;.</p>

    <p>On Wednesday 30 July, yesterday that is, I arrived in Auvers
    at about 10 o'clock. His brother, Theodore van ghohg [sic], was there
    together with Dr. Gachet. Also Tanguy (he had been there since
    9 o'clock). Charles Laval accompanied me. The coffin was
    already closed, I arrived too late to see the man again who had
    left me four years ago so full of expectations of all
    kinds&hellip; The innkeeper told us all the details of the
    accident, the offensive visit of the gendarmes who even went up
    to his bedside to reproach him for an act for which he alone
    was responsible&hellip;etc&hellip;</p>

    <p>On the walls of the room where his body was laid out all his
    last canvases were hung making a sort of halo for him and the
    brilliance of the genius that radiated from them made this
    death even more painful for us artists who were there. The
    coffin was covered with a simple white cloth and surrounded
    with masses of flowers, the sunflowers that he loved so much,
    yellow dahlias, yellow flowers everywhere. It was, you will
    remember, his favourite colour, the symbol of the light that he
    dreamed of as being in people's hearts as well as in works of
    art.</p>

    <p>Near him also on the floor in front of his coffin were his
    easel, his folding stool and his brushes.</p>

    <p>Many people arrived, mainly artists, among whom I recognized
    Lucien Pissarro and Lauzet, the others I did not know, also
    some local people who had known him a little, seen him once o
    twice and who liked him because he was so good-hearted, so
    human&hellip;</p>

    <p>There we were, completely silent all of us together around
    this coffin that held our friend. I looked at the studies; a
    very beautiful and sad one based on <art id=0757>Delacroix's La vierge et
    Jesus</art>. Convicts walking in a circle surrounded by high prison
    walls, <art id=0669>a canvas inspired by Dor&eacute;</art> of a terrifying
    ferocity and which is also symbolic of his end. Wasn't life
    like that for him, a high prison like this with such high walls
    - so high&hellip;and these people walking endlessly round this
    pit, weren't they the poor artists, the poor damned souls
    walking past under the whip of Destiny?&hellip;</p>

    <p>At three o'clock his body was moved, friends of his carrying
    it to the hearse, a number of people in the company were in
    tears. Theodore Van ghohg who was devoted to his brother, who
    had always supported him in his struggle to support himself
    from his art was sobbing pitifully the whole time&hellip;</p>

    <p>The sun was terribly hot outside. We climbed the hill
    outside Auvers talking about him, about the daring impulse he
    had given to art, of the great projects he was always thinking
    about, and of the good he had done to all of us.</p>

    <p>We reached the cemetery, a small new cemetery strewn with
    new tombstones. It is on the little hill above the fields that
    were ripe for harvest under the wide blue sky that he would
    still have loved&hellip;perhaps.</p>

    <p>Then he was lowered into the grave&hellip;</p>

    <p>Anyone would have started crying at that moment&hellip;the
    day was too much made for him for one not to imagine that he
    was still alive and enjoying it&hellip;</p>

    <p>Dr. Gachet (who is a great lover and possesses one of the
    best collections of impressionist painting of the present day)
    wanted to say a few words of homage about Vincent and his life,
    but he too was crying so much that he could only stammer a very
    confused farewell&hellip;(the most beautiful way, perhaps).</p>

    <p>He briefly outlined Vincent's achievements, stating how
    sublime his goal was and how great an admiration he felt for
    him (though he had only known him a short time). He was, Gachet
    said, an honest man and a great artist, he had only two aims,
    humanity and art. It was art that he prized above everything
    and which will make his name live.</p>

    <p>Then we returned. Theodore Van ghog was broken with grief;
    everyone who attended was very moved, some going off into the
    open country while others went back to the station.</p>

    <p>Laval and I returned to Ravoux's house, and we talked about
    him&hellip;</p>

    <p>But that is quite enough, my dear Aurier, quite enough,
    don't you think, about this sad day. You know how much I loved
    him and you can imagine how much I wept. You are his critic, so
    don't forget him but try and write a few words to tell everyone
    that his funeral was a crowning finale that was truly worthy of
    his great spirit and his great talent.</p>

    <p>With my heartfelt wishes</p>

    <p>Bernard</p>
