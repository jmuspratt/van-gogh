  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>The last time I wrote you I was in such a hurry. Right now I
    need all my time, because I am working a full two hours from
    here. What I want is to have some more beautiful hovels far
    away on the heath. I have four now, as large as the two I last
    sent you, and a few smaller ones. They are not yet dry, and I
    think I shall give them the finishing touches in the studio.
    But then I want to send them to you together with some figure
    studies, to show the latter to Serret. But now I want to tell
    you that for the present, as there are about six rather large
    paintings, I intend to make only small ones. Especially because
    according to what Raffaelli and Mantz and others' articles say,
    at the last Salon and in general there were a great many
    enormous canvases.</p>

    <p>Though I have not read this in one of the articles, this
    Salon might perhaps be called &ldquo;Le Salon des marchands de
    couleur.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I should like to send you this lot before you come here,
    because otherwise so much time will be lost.</p>

    <p>And then I shall take up quite different subjects again.</p>

    <p>I think that you will see from the things I brought from the
    heath that it is very characteristic there. The interiors are
    splendid, and now I have made some friends there among the
    people, with whom I am always welcome.</p>

    <p>How did it go with the money this month? I hope a little
    better than you expected, for it worried me when you wrote that
    you were hard up yourself. I had to pay so much in the
    beginning of this month and have only just 5 guilders left. And
    it is still a long time before the end of the month.</p>

    <p>And next month I shall again have much to pay. I cannot and
    may not do otherwise than spend relatively much on models.</p>

    <p>It is the same here as everywhere, people do not like to
    pose, and if it weren't for the money, <i>nobody</i> would.</p>

    <p>But as they are for the most part very poor, and especially
    many weavers are out of work, I can somehow manage to get them.
    But painting what I want, and especially improving the figures,
    is a question of money.</p>

    <p>Did you read in Sensier's book that when Millet had the good
    fortune to inherit some thousand francs, instead of using it to
    make himself a little more comfortable - indeed, he was poor
    enough - he immediately set out on a trip to his native
    village, in order to paint the peasants there again, and it
    swallowed up his whole legacy, and <i>Millet was right</i>.</p>

    <p>Others did the same - for instance, Paul Dubois, who spent
    his whole patrimony on models, and was for a time quite
    melancholy because of money worries.</p>

    <p>But I haven't any legacy to expect - and I cannot do as I
    should like.</p>

    <p>But pardon me when I say that, if Serret and you - and very
    rightly too - want to see other qualities in my figures, I
    shall have to spend more on my models. I do not know how people
    manage to fill the Salon with yards and yards of canvas. Well,
    among those cottages there are a few that I have painted in a
    much brighter tone; but I repeat, however much I may like grey
    pictures, more and more I appreciate the people who also paint
    the more gloomy effects beside the silver-grey colour
    scale.</p>

    <p>What I shall do now - if the month turns out a little better
    than you expected, and if you can send something extra, however
    little - is to send you the four pictures. Otherwise - I shan't
    have the money to send them. But in that case I will send them
    as soon as I have the money for next month, and, at all events,
    before that time, the figure studies to show Serret.</p>

    <p>But I hope you will bring those figure studies back when you
    come. For I am going to add others which I need for
    painting.</p>

    <p>I shall want them for figures that are definitely not larger
    than, for instance, a span and even less - so that everything
    in it will become even more concentrated.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
