    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>I wish you were able to see that in several things I must be
    consistent.</p>

    <p>You know what an &ldquo;erreur de point de vue&rdquo; [error
    in one's point of view] represents in painting, viz. something
    far different and far worse than a faulty drawing of such or
    such a detail. A single point decides the greater or lesser
    gradient: the development more to the right or left of the
    sideplanes of the objects throughout the whole composition.</p>

    <p>Well, in life there is something like this.</p>

    <p>When I say I am a poor painter and have still years of
    struggle ahead - my everyday life I must arrange
    &ldquo;&agrave; peu pr&egrave;s&rdquo; [approximately] like a
    farm labourer or a factory hand does; then this is a fixed
    point, from which many things result, which one tears from
    their roots, when one considers them otherwise but
    comprehensively. There are painters in other circumstances who
    can and must act differently.</p>

    <p>Everyone must decide for himself. If I had had other
    chances, had been in different circumstances, and if no
    decisive things had happened, of course that would have
    influenced my actions. Now however, and &ldquo;&agrave; plus
    forte raison,&rdquo; [with all the more reason] if there were
    even the slightest question of it being considered arrogance
    on my part to assume a right to which I had no claim - even if
    I had this right as a matter of course - the mere suggestion of
    the thing would have made me withdraw of my own accord from any
    intercourse with people who occupy a certain rank in life, even
    my own people.</p>

    <p>So this is the fact: My firm resolve is to be dead to
    anything except my work. But it is very hard for me to speak
    about those things, simple in themselves, but which
    unfortunately link up with much deeper things.</p>

    <p>There is no anguish greater than the soul's struggle
    between duty and love, both in their highest meaning. When I
    tell you I choose my duty, you will understand everything.</p>

    <p>A simple word said about it during our walk, made me feel
    that absolutely nothing is changed in me in that respect, that
    it is and remains a wound which I carry with me, while it lies
    deep and cannot be healed. After years it will be the same as
    it was the first day.[Kee Vos].</p>

    <p>I hope you understand what battle I have had to fight within
    myself of late.</p>

    <p>The upshot was this: <i>quoiqu'il en soit</i> [be that as it
    may] (not taking the <i>quoi</i> as interrogative, for I have
    not the right to consider it so) I will do my utmost to remain
    an honest man and doubly attentive to <i>duty</i>.</p>

    <p>I have never suspected <i>her</i>, nor do I suspect her now,
    nor shall I ever suspect her, of having had any but right and
    proper financial motives. She went as far as was reasonable,
    other people exaggerated. But for the rest, you understand that
    I do not hold any delusive convictions about love for me, and
    what we talked of on the road remains between us. Since then,
    things have happened that would not have taken place, if at a
    certain moment I had not had to face in the first place a
    decided &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and secondly a promise that I would
    not stand in her way. I respected in her a sense of duty - I
    never have suspected, shall never suspect her of anything
    mean.</p>

    <p>Of myself I know this one thing, that it is of the greatest
    importance not to deviate from one's duty, and that one should
    not compromise with duty. Duty is absolute. The consequences?
    We are not responsible for them, but for the choice of
    <i>doing</i> or <i>not doing</i> our duty, we are responsible.
    This is the direct opposite of the principle: The end
    justi-fies the means.</p>

    <p>And my own future is a cup that may not pass away from me
    except I drink it.</p>

    <p>So &ldquo;Fiat voluntas.&rdquo; [Thy will be done]</p>

    <p>Regards - good luck on your journey - write soon - but you
    know now how I shall face the future, with serenity, and
    without a line on my face to betray the struggle in my very
    depths -</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>You will understand, however, that I must avoid everything
    which might tempt me to hesitate, so that I <i>must</i> avoid
    everything and everybody that would remind me of
    <i>her</i>. In fact that idea has made me this year
    sometimes more resolute than I otherwise would have been, and
    you see that I can do it in such a way that nobody understands
    the real motive.</p>
