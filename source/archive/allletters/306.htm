  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>To my surprise, I received another letter from you yesterday
    with a bank note enclosed. I needn't tell you how glad I was,
    and I thank you heartily for it. But they refused to change the
    bank note because it was too torn. However, they gave me 10
    guilders on it, and it has been forwarded to Paris. If the bank
    refuses it, I'll have to pay back the 10 guilders - for which I
    had to sign a receipt - but if the bank changes it, I'll get
    the rest later.</p>

    <p>In your letter you write about the conflict one sometimes
    has about whether one is responsible for the unfortunate
    results of a good action - if it wouldn't be better to act in a
    way one knows to be wrong, but which will keep one from getting
    hurt - I know that conflict too. If we follow our conscience -
    for me conscience is the highest reason - the reason within the
    reason - we are tempted to think we have acted wrongly or
    foolishly; we are especially upset when more superficial people
    jeer at us, because they are so much wiser and are so much more
    successful. Yes, then it is sometimes difficult, and when
    circumstances occur which make the difficulties rise like a
    tidal wave, one is almost sorry to be the way one is, and would
    wish to have been less conscientious.</p>

    <p>I hope you don't think of me as other than having that same
    inner conflict continually, and often very tired brains too,
    and in many cases not knowing how to decide questions of right
    and wrong</p>

    <p>When I am at work, I have an unlimited faith in art and the
    conviction that I shall succeed; but in days of physical
    prostration or when there are financial obstacles, I feel that
    faith diminishing, and a doubt overwhelms me, which I try to
    conquer by setting to work again at once. It's the same thing
    with the woman and the children; when I am with them and the
    little boy comes creeping toward me on all fours, crowing for
    joy, I haven't the slightest doubt that everything is
    right.</p>

    <p>How often that child has comforted me.</p>

    <p>When I'm home, he can't leave me alone for a moment; when
    I'm at work, he pulls at my coat or climbs up against my leg
    till I take him on my lap. In the studio, he crows at
    everything, plays quietly with a bit of paper, a bit of string,
    or an old brush; the child is always happy. If he keeps this
    disposition all his life, he will be cleverer than I.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">Now what shall we say about the fact that at times one feels
    there is a certain fatality which makes the good turn out wrong
    and the bad turn out well.</p>

    <p>I think one may consider these thoughts partly the
    consequence of overwrought nerves, and if one has them, one
    must not think it one's duty to believe that things are really
    as gloomy as one supposes; if one did, it would make one mad.
    On the contrary, it is reasonable to one's physique then, and
    later set to work like a man; and even if that doesn't help,
    one must still always continue to use those two means, and
    consider such melancholy fatal. Then in the long run one will
    feel one's energy increase, and will bear up against the
    troubles.</label></p>

    <p>Mysteries remain, and sorrow or melancholy, but that eternal
    negative is balanced by the positive work which is thus
    achieved after all. If life were as simple, and things as
    little complicated as a goody-goody's story or the hackneyed
    sermon of the average clergyman, it wouldn't be so very
    difficult to make one's way. But it isn't, and things are
    infinitely more complicated, and right and wrong do not exist
    separately, any more than black and white do in nature. One
    must be careful not to fall back on opaque black - on
    deliberate wrong - and even more, one has to avoid the white as
    of a whitewashed wall, which means hypocrisy and everlasting
    Pharisaism. He who courageously tries to follow his reason, and
    especially his conscience, the very highest reason - the
    sublime reason - and tries to stay honest, can hardly lose his
    way entirely, I think, though he will not get off without
    mistakes, rebuffs and moments of weakness, and will not achieve
    perfection.</p>

    <p>And I think it will give him a deep feeling of pity and
    benevolence, broader than the narrow-mindedness which is the
    clergyman's specialty.</p>

    <p>One may not be considered of the slightest importance by
    either of the parties, and one may be counted among the
    mediocrities and feel like a thoroughly ordinary man among
    ordinary people - for all but one will retain a rather steady
    serenity in the end. One will succeed in developing one's
    conscience to such a point that it becomes the voice of a
    better and higher self, of which the ordinary self is the
    servant. And one will not return to skepticism or cynicism, and
    not belong among the foul scoffers. But not at once. I think it
    a beautiful saying of Michelet's, and in those few words
    Michelet expresses all I mean, &ldquo;Socrate naquit un vrai
    satyr, mais par le d&eacute;vouement, le travail, le
    renoncement des choses frivoles, il se changea si
    compl&egrave;tement qu'au dernier jour devant ses juges et
    devant sa mort il y avait en lui je ne sais quoi d'un dieu, un
    rayon d'en haut dont s'illumina le Parth&eacute;non.&rdquo;
    [Socrates was born as a true satyr, but by devotion, work and
    renouncing frivolous things he changed so completely that on
    the last day before his judges and in the face of death, there
    was in him something, I do not know what, of a god, a ray of
    light from heaven that illuminated the Parthenon.]</p>

    <p>One sees the same thing In Jesus too; first he was an
    ordinary carpenter, but raised himself to something else,
    whatever it may have been - a personality so full of pity,
    love, goodness, seriousness that one is still attracted by it.
    Generally, a carpenter's apprentice becomes a master carpenter,
    narrow-minded, dry, miserly, vain; and whatever it may be said
    of Jesus, he had another conception of things than my friend
    the carpenter of the backyard, who has raised himself to the
    rank of house owner, and is much vainer and has a higher
    opinion of himself than Jesus had.</p>

    <p>But I must not become too abstract. What I want to do first
    is renew my strength, and I think when it has risen again from
    below par, I shall get ideas from my work, for trying to
    overcome that dryness.</p>

    <p>When you come here, we shall talk it over. I don't think
    it's a question of a few days.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">In a few days, when I shall have had some more nourishing
    food than recently, I think I shall get rid of my <i>worst
    depression</i>; but it is more deeply rooted than that, and I
    wish I could get to the point where I had plenty of health and
    strength, which is after all not impossible when one is
    out-of-doors a great deal and has a task one loves.</label></p>

    <p>For it is a fact that now all my work is <i>too meager and
    too dry</i>.</p>

    <p>Recently this has become as clear as daylight to me, and I
    haven't the slightest doubt that a general thorough change is
    necessary. I intend to talk over with you, <i>after you have
    seen this year's work</i>, whether you agree with me about some
    measures; and if you agree with me, I think we shall succeed in
    overcoming the difficulties. We must not hesitate, but
    &ldquo;avoir la foi de charbonnier.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I hope they will change the banknote. I'm so glad you have
    managed to send something, for I think it saves me from
    illness. I'll let you know how the story of the banknote ends.
    And it would be a good thing if you could send the usual again
    by the first of August. I always think that it is possible that
    we shall hit on another plan for the future when looking
    through the work together. I don't know what, as yet - but
    somewhere there must be work which I can do just as well as
    anybody else. If London were nearer, I should try there.</p>

    <p>Know it well that I should be enormously pleased if I could
    make something that was salable. In that case I should have
    less scruples about the money I get from you, which after all
    you need as much as I. Once more many thanks, goodbye.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
