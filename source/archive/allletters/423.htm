  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and the enclosed 150 francs. I also
    received the two Lhermittes today. He is the absolute master of
    the figure, he does what he likes with it - proceeding neither
    from the colour nor from the local tone but rather from the
    light - as Rembrandt did - there is an astonishing mastery in
    everything he does, above all excelling in modelling, he
    perfectly satisfies all that honesty demands.</p>

    <p>People talk a great deal about Poussin. Bracquemond also
    speaks of him. The French call Poussin the very greatest
    painter among the old masters. Well, it is certainly true that
    what is said about Poussin, of whom I know so very little, is
    also true of Lhermitte and Millet. But with this difference,
    that Poussin seems to me the original grain; the others, the
    full ear. As for me, I think the modern ones the <i>most
    superior</i>.</p>

    <p>These last two weeks I have had a lot of trouble with the
    reverend gentlemen of the clergy, who gave me to understand,
    albeit with the best intentions and believing like so many
    others that they were obliged to intervene - that I ought not
    to be too familiar with people below me in station. But while
    they put the matter to me in these terms, they used quite a
    different tone with the &ldquo;people of lower station,&rdquo;
    namely, threatening them if they allowed themselves to be
    painted. This time I went straight to the Burgomaster and told
    him all about it, pointing out that it was no business of the
    priests, and that they ought to stick to their own sphere of
    more abstract concerns. In any case, for the moment I am having
    no more opposition from them and I hope it will stay like
    that.</p>

    <p>A girl I had frequently painted was about to have a baby and
    they suspected me, though I had nothing to do with it. But I
    heard what had really happened from the girl herself, namely
    that a member of the priest's own congregation in Nuenen had
    played a particularly ugly part in the affair, and so they
    could not get at me, at least not on that occasion. But you can
    see that it isn't easy to paint people in their own home or to
    draw them going about their business.</p>

    <p>Well, they will not easily get the better of me in this
    case, and this winter I hope to keep the very same models, who
    are thoroughly typical of the old Brabant race.</p>

    <p>I again have a few new drawings, but I could by no means get
    anybody to pose for me in the fields these days.</p>

    <p>Happily for me, the priest is getting rather unpopular. But
    it is a bad thing, and if it continued, I should have to move.
    You will ask, What's the use of making yourself disagreeable? -
    but sometimes it cannot be avoided. If I had argued gently with
    them, they would undoubtedly have got the better of me. And
    when they hinder me in my work, I sometimes do not see any
    other way than an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. The
    priest even went so far as to promise the people money if they
    refused to be painted: but they answered quite spiritedly that
    they would rather earn money from me than beg some from
    him.</p>

    <p>But you see they do it only for the sake of earning money,
    and they do <i>nothing</i> for <i>nothing</i> here.</p>

    <p>You ask me if Rappard has ever sold anything. I know that at
    present he is better off than he used to be, that, for
    instance, for some time he took models from the nude every day,
    that now, for the picture of a brickyard, he rented a small
    house on the spot itself, and had it improved with a skylight;
    I know that he made another trip through Drenthe, and that he
    will also go to Terschelling. All these things are rather
    expensive, and the money for it must come from somewhere.
    Though he may possess some money of his own, he must certainly
    earn something too, otherwise he couldn't do what he does.
    Perhaps his family buys, or friends - that may be - but
    somebody must.</p>

    <p>But tonight I am much too occupied with Lhermitte's drawings
    to go on writing about other things. When I think of Millet or
    of Lhermitte, I find modern art as great as Michelangelo and
    Rembrandt - ancient art is infinite, modern art infinite too -
    the ancient masters are <i>geniuses</i> - the modern ones are
    <i>geniuses</i> too. A person like Chenavard does not think so
    perhaps. But I, for my part, am convinced that in this respect
    one can have faith in modern art.</p>

    <p>The fact that I have a definite belief about art makes me
    sure of what I want in my own work, and I shall try to reach it
    even at the risk of my own life.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
