    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half September 1884</p>

    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I wrote you today and your letter from Terschelling crossed
    mine.</p>

    <p>I am greatly pleased to hear that you are going to bring
    back rather a lot of things from your trip, and from what you
    say about your studies I am confident that you will bring along
    <i>useful</i> things. I still regret that I have not seen that
    picture &ldquo;Fish Market,&rdquo; even in its first stage.
    <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">As I told you already, what I said about it may be wrong in
    so far as my words - &ldquo;<i>If</i> you keep the division of
    the space substantially as it is now, it is my opinion that it
    can be saved only by a division of light and brown, a vigorous
    effect of chiaroscuro&rdquo; - may apply to something quite
    different, may flatly contradict your intention - if you wanted
    to make a grey picture, for instance. And yet - I suppose your
    sketch conforms to the picture with regard to the amount of
    <i>canvas space</i> taken up by your figures as compared to the
    canvas space taken up by the houses, street, sky. And then it
    struck me at once that the figures would be crushed by the
    rest, and that there would be too much of a <i>struggle</i>
    between the figures and the surroundings.</label></p>

    <p>Well, I'm damned sorry I didn't see the picture itself in
    its first stage.</p>

    <p>All the same I did not lose sight of the fact - as you
    suppose - that it is <i>you</i> who are making the picture, not
    I - but I base my argument on something you will hardly deny,
    namely <i>that you are making a</i> PICTURE.</p>

    <p>And a picture - whoever the artist may be - you or anyone
    else - should express preferably one thing only and that
    <i>quite clearly</i>.</p>

    <p>Speaking of Van der Weele, I remember saying to him about
    the picture which he got a medal for in Amsterdam - and this
    contrary to the opinion of others - that I greatly appreciated
    his having succeeded so well in preserving the <i>unity of</i>
    STYLE despite all the different things that appeared in it, and
    that it really and truly <i>was a picture</i>, i.e<i>.</i>
    something quite different from a realistic study <i>from</i>
    nature.</p>

    <p>But - after all - I know nothing of your original concept,
    except from that hasty little sketch, and I don't doubt in the
    least that there will be praiseworthy things in it. But all the
    same I stick to what I said, and I want to point out again that
    I am <i>afraid</i> that your <i>foreground</i>, for instance,
    <i>cannot carry</i> all the things standing in it - it will
    either become <i>paint</i> or else unfixed and woolly - what is
    called <i>mou</i>. This very summer the same thing happened to
    me with a weaver's interior that I could not go on with because
    the whole thing came too much to the forefront - because the
    picture began with what ought to have been the <i>second</i>
    plane - the first plane, the solid foundation, was missing. And
    I reproached myself in the same way that I am now speaking to
    you.</p>

    <p>It is something that happens <i>very often</i> to nearly all
    painters, and it may happen that it can be remedied only by
    transferring the whole to a <i>larger</i> canvas.</p>

    <p>By the way, do you know &ldquo;Ordered off&rdquo; by Frank
    Hol in the London News? I brought it back from Utrecht together
    with a &ldquo;Shepherd&rdquo; by Thompson.</p>

    <p>Good-by. I hope you will come in October; if possible, write
    in advance the exact date when you are coming.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
