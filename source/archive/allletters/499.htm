  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am at last writing to you from Stes-Maries on the shore of
    the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean has the colours of
    mackerel, changeable I mean. You don't always know if it is
    green or violet, you can't even say it's blue, because the next
    moment the changing light has taken on a tinge of pink or
    gray.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">A family is a queer thing - quite involuntary and in spite
    of myself I have been thinking here between whiles of our
    sailor uncle, who must have seen the shores of this sea many a
    time.</label></p>

    <p>I brought three canvases and have covered them - <art id=0415>two</art>
    <art id=0417>marines</art>, <art id=0416>a view of the village</art>, and then some drawings
    which I will send you by post when I return to Arles tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I have board and lodging for 4 francs a day and they began
    by asking 6.</p>

    <p>As soon as I can, I shall probably come back again to make
    some more studies.</p>

    <p>The shore here is sandy, neither cliffs nor rocks - like
    Holland without the dunes, and bluer.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">You get better fried fish here than on the Seine. Only fish
    is not available every day, as the fishermen go off and sell it
    in Marseilles. But when there is some, it's frightfully
    good.</p>

    <p>If there isn't - the butcher is not much more appetizing
    than the fellah butcher of M. G&eacute;r&ocirc;me's - if there
    is no fish, it is pretty difficult to get anything to eat, as
    far as I can see.</label></p>

    <p>I do not think there are 100 houses in the village, or town.
    The chief building, after the old church and an ancient
    fortress, is the barracks. And the houses - like the ones on
    our heaths and peat bogs in Drenthe; you will see some
    specimens of them in the drawings.</p>

    <p>I am forced to leave my three painted studies here, for of
    course they are not dry enough to be submitted with safety to
    five hours' jolting in the carriage.</p>

    <p>But I expect to come back here again.</p>

    <p>Next week I'd like to go to Tarascon to do two or three
    studies.</p>

    <p>If you have not written yet, I shall naturally expect the
    letter at Arles.</p>

    <p>A very fine gendarme came to interview me here, and the
    cur&eacute; too - the people can't be very bad here, because
    even the cur&eacute; looked almost like a decent fellow.</p>

    <p>Next month it will be the season for open-air bathing here.
    The number of bathers varies from 20 to 50. I am staying till
    tomorrow afternoon, I still have some drawings to do.</p>

    <p>One night I went for a walk by the sea along the empty
    shore. It was not gay, but neither was it sad - it was -
    beautiful. The deep blue sky was flecked with clouds of a blue
    deeper than the fundamental blue of intense cobalt, and others
    of a clearer blue, like the blue whiteness of the Milky Way. In
    the blue depth the stars were sparkling, greenish, yellow,
    white, pink, more brilliant, more emeralds, lapis lazuli,
    rubies, sapphires. The sea was very deep ultramarine - the
    shore a sort of violet and faint russet as I saw it, and on the
    dunes (they are about seventeen feet high) some bushes Prussian
    blue.</p>

    <p>Besides half-page drawings I have <art id=1439>a big drawing</art>, the pendant
    of the last one. Good-by for the present only, I hope, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
