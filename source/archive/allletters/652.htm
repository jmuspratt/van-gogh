  <body>
    <p>[Jo's note: 'This letter, evidently his penultimate one to
    Theo, was found on Vincent's body after his suicide on the
    27th. There is a note at the top in Theo's handwriting on it:
    &ldquo;Letter he was carrying on him July 29&rdquo;'. In fact, it is obviously a rough draught of
    letter 651].</p>

    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your kind letter and for the 50 fr. note it contained</p>

    <p>There are many things I should like to write you about, but
    I feel it is pointless. I hope you have found these
    gentlemen favorably disposed toward you.</p>

    <p>Your reassuring me as to the state of peace of your household
    was not worth the trouble, I think, having seen the other
    side of it for myself. And I quite agree with you that rearing a
    boy on a fourth floor is a hell of a job for you as well as
    Jo.</p>

    <p>Since it is going well, which is the main thing,
    I should insist on things of less importance. My word, before we
    have a chance of talking business more calmly, there is
    probably a long way to go.That is all I want to say, that I noted it with a certain
    fright and I cannot hide it. But that is all there is to it.</p>

    <p>The other painters, whatever they think of it, instinctively
    keep themselves at a distance from discussions about actual trade.</p>

    <p>Well, the truth is, we cannot speak other than by our paintings. But
    still, my dear brother, there is this that I have always told
    you, and I repeat it once more with all the earnestness that
    can be imparted by an effort of a mind diligently fixed on
    trying to do as well as one can - I tell you again that I shall
    always consider that you are something other than a simple
    dealer in Corots, that through my mediation you have your part
    in the actual production of some canvases, which even in the
    cataclysm retain their calm.</p>

    <p>For this is what we have got to, and this is all or at least
    the chief thing that I can have to tell you at a moment of
    comparative crisis. At a moment when things are very strained
    between dealers in paintings by dead artists, and living
    artists.</p>

    <p>Well, my work to me, I risk my life on it, and my reason has half foundered
    - all right - but you are not one of those dealers in men, as far as I know, and
    you can take sides, I find, truly acting with humanity, but what is the use?</p>
