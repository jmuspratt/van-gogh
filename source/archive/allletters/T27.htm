    <p>Letter T27<br>
     Paris, 31 January 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">Dr. Peyron wrote to tell me that you had had a paroxysm of
    your malady once again. My poor brother, I am infinitely sorry
    that things do not go with you as they ought to. Fortunately it
    did not last long the last time, and we hope ardently that you
    will recover quickly this time too.</label> This is the only cloud in
    the sky of our happiness, for, my dear brother, the bad moment
    for Jo is past. She has brought into the world a beautiful boy,
    who cries a good deal, but who looks healthy. My poor little
    wife suffered a lot, because the waters came too soon, but
    fortunately we had an excellent doctor, who had extraordinary
    patience, for anyone else in his place would certainly have
    used forceps. Jo is very well, and has not had any fever, but
    it might come on yet. The child has started crying already.</p>

    <p>How happy I should be if after some time, when Jo has
    recovered, you could come to see her and our little fellow. As
    we told you at the time, we are going to name him after you,
    and I devoutly hope that he will be able to be as persevering
    and as courageous as you. Please write to me as soon as you can
    to tell me how you are, and whether there have been occurrences
    which may have provoked the new crisis.</p>

    <p>We speak of you frequently and we think of you still more
    frequently. I hope with all my heart that you will get better
    in the near future.</p>

    <p>Be of good heart!</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Theo</p>
