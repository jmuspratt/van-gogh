  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I did not quite dare to hope for your new money order for 50
    francs so soon, and I thank you very much for it.</p>

    <p>I have a lot of expenses, and it worries me a good deal
    sometimes when I realize more and more that painting is a
    profession carried on most likely by exceedingly poor men, and
    it costs so much money.</p>

    <p>But the autumn still continues to be so beautiful! It's a
    queer place, this native land of Tartarin's! Yes, I am content
    with my lot, it isn't a superb, sublime country, this; it is
    only a Daumier come to life.</p>

    <p>Have you reread the Tartarins yet? Be sure not to forget. Do you
    remember that wonderful page in Tartarin, the complaint of the
    old Tarascon diligence? Well, <art id=0478a>I have just painted that red and
    green vehicle in the courtyard of the inn.</art> You will see it.</p>

    <p>[<art id=681_V-T_5520>A sketch of the Tarascon Diligence appears here.</art>]</p>

    <p>This hasty sketch gives you the composition, a simple
    foreground of grey sand, background very simple too,
    pink and yellow walls, with windows with green shutters, and a
    corner of blue sky. The two carriages very colourful,
    green and red, the wheels yellow, black, blue and orange.
    Again a size 30 canvas. The carriages are painted like a Monticelli, thickly laid
    paint. You used to have a very fine Claude Monet showing four coloured
    boats on a beach. Well, here they are carriages, but the
    composition is in the same style.</p>

    <p>[<art id=681_V-T_5521>A sketch of "Poet's Garden III" appears here.</art>]</p>

    <p><art id=0479>Now imagine an immense greenish-blue pine, spreading
    its branches horizontally over a bright green lawn, and gravel
    splashed with light and shade. This very simple patch of garden
    is brightened by beds of geraniums, lead orange in the background
    under the black branches. Two figures of lovers in the shade of
    the great tree; size 30 canvas.</art></p>

    <p>Then two other size 30 canvases,<art id=0481> the Trinquetaille bridge</art>
    and <art id=0480>another bridge, along the road passing under the railway.</art></p>

    <p>[<art id=681_V-T_5522>Two sketches of "The Railway Bridge" and "The Trinquetaille Bridge" appear here.</art>]</p>

    <p>This canvas is a little like a Bosboom in colour.</p>

    <p>The Trinquetaille bridge with all these steps is a canvas done on a
    grey morning, the stones, the asphalt, the pavements are grey;
    the sky, pale blue, the figures, coloured; and there is a
    sickly tree with yellow foliage. Two canvases in gray and
    blended tones, and two highly coloured ones.</p>

    <p>Forgive these very bad sketches, I am half dead with painting
    that Tarascon diligence, and I see that I am not in the right
    mood for drawing.</p>

    <p>I am just going to have dinner and I'll write you again this
    evening.</p>

    <p>But these decorations are getting on a bit, and I think that
    they will broaden my way of seeing and doing things.</p>

    <p>There will be a thousand things to criticize in it, but
    that's all right provided I can manage to get some verve into
    it.</p>

    <p>But here's to the country of good old Tartarin, I am
    enjoying myself in it more and more, and it is going to be our
    second fatherland. Not that I forget Holland, the very
    contrasts make one think of it many a time. I will go on with
    this letter directly.</p>

    <p>I am going on with it now. I so much wish I could show you
    the work that I am doing.</p>

    <p>I am really so tired that I can see my writing isn't
    much.</p>

    <p>I'll write better another time, because the idea of this
    decoration is beginning to take shape.</p>

    <p>I wrote Gauguin again the day before yesterday to say once
    again that he would probably recover more quickly here.</p>

    <p>And he will do such beautiful things here.</p>

    <p>He will need time to recover, I tell you.<label content="food-and-drink.diet"> I assure you, I
    believe that if ideas for my work come swarming over me now,
    and more clearly too, eating decent cooked food has a lot to do
    with it, and that is what everyone who paints ought to
    have.</label></p>

    <p>What a lot of things there are that ought to be changed.
    Isn't it true that all painters ought to live like workmen? A
    carpenter or a blacksmith is accustomed to producing infinitely
    more than they do. And in painting too we should have large
    studios where each man would work with greater regularity.</p>

    <p><label content="health.fatigue">I am really falling asleep and I can't see any more, my eyes
    are so tired.</label></p>

    <p>Good-by for the present, because I still have a lot to say,
    and I must make you some better sketches. I shall probably make
    them tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Thank you again very much for your money order. A good
    handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>That's 5 canvases I have in progress this week, that brings
    the number of these size 30 canvases for the decoration to 15, I think.</p>
