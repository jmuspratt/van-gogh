  <body>
    <p>My dear comrade Bernard,</p>

    <p>Perhaps you will be inclined to forgive me for not replying
    to your letter immediately, when you see that I am sending you
    a little batch of sketches along with this letter.</p>

    <p>In <art id=1450>the sketch &ldquo;The Garden&rdquo;</art> maybe there is
    something like</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    &ldquo;Des tapis velus<br>

    De fleurs et de verdures tissus&rdquo;<br>

    <p></p>

    [Shaggy carpets woven<br>

    Of flowers and greenery]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>by Crivelli or Virelli, it doesn't matter much which.</p>

    <p>Well, anyway, I wanted to answer your quotations with the
    pen, but not by writing down words. Today too I am hardly in a
    mood for discussions; I am up to my ears in work.</p>

    <p>I have done some large pen-and-ink drawings. Two: <art id=1420>an immense
    stretch of flat country, a bird's-eye view of it seen from the
    top of a hill</art> - vineyards and fields of newly reaped wheat. All
    this multiplied in endless repetitions, stretching away toward
    the horizon like the surface of a sea, bordered by the little
    hills of the Crau.</p>

    <p><art id=1446>It does not have a Japanese look, and yet it is really the
    most Japanese thing I have done; a microscopic figure of a
    ploughman, a little train running across the wheat field - this
    is all the animation there is in it.</art></p>

    <p>Listen, one of the first days after I came to this spot I
    talked to a painter friend of mine, who said, &ldquo;How boring
    it would be to do this.&rdquo; I didn't say anything, but I
    thought it so astounding that I didn't even have the strength
    to give that idiot a piece of my mind. And I am still going
    there, over and over again. All right! I have done two drawings
    of it - of that flat landscape, where there was nothing but ...
    infinity - eternity.</p>

    <p>All right! While I was drawing, there came along a fellow
    who is not a painter but a soldier [Milliet]. I said to him &ldquo;Does
    it amaze you that I think this as beautiful as the
    sea?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Now this fellow knew the sea. &ldquo;No, it doesn't amaze
    me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you think this as beautiful as
    the sea, but I myself think it even more beautiful than the
    ocean; because it is <i>inhabited&rdquo;</i></p>

    <p>Which of the two spectators was more of an artist, the first
    or the second, the painter or the soldier? Personally I prefer
    the soldier's eye - am I right or not?</p>

    <p>Now it is my turn to say to you, Answer me quickly - this
    time by return mail - to let me know whether you will consent
    to make some sketches after your Breton studies for me. I have
    a package ready to be forwarded, but before it goes off I want
    to do at least halt a dozen new subjects for you, pen-and-ink
    sketches.</p>

    <p>Having little doubt of what you will do for your friends, I
    myself shall start working all the same, even if I don't know
    whether or not you want to do it. You see, I am going to send
    these sketches to my brother to persuade him to take some of
    them for our collection. As a matter of fact I have already
    written to him on the subject; but we have started on an
    enterprise which leaves us absolutely without a penny. The fact
    is that Gauguin, who has been very ill, is probably going to
    spend next winter with me here, in the South. And it is the
    cost of his journey which causes us a lot of worry. Once he is
    here - my goodness, when you are two you spend less than when
    you are alone. All the more reason why I want to have some of
    your things here. <label content="feelings.ambition">Once Gauguin is here, the two of us will try
    to do something in Marseilles, and will probably have an
    exhibition there.</label> Now I should like to have some things of
    yours too - without spoiling your chances of making a sale in
    Paris, however. At any rate I don't think you will lose by it,
    if I can persuade you to make a mutual exchange of sketches
    after painted studies. And we shall strike another bargain as
    soon as I can, but I am rather hard up at the moment.</p>

    <p>I am sure of one thing - namely, if sooner or later Gauguin
    and I have an exhibition in Marseilles, Gauguin as well as I
    myself will invite you to participate in it. At last Thomas has
    bought Anquetin's study, &ldquo;The Peasant.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>A cordial handshake; more before long,</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Vincent</p>
