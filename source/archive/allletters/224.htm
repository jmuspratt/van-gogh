  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>During the few days since you left, I have made some
    experiments with painting. And I thought you might be curious
    to know how it turned out. I wish you could spend an hour with
    me in the studio again, that would be the best way to tell you
    how it went. But as this is of course impossible, I shall only
    tell you that I now have three painted studies. One of a row of
    pollard willows in a meadow (behind the Geest bridge); then a
    study of the cinder path near here; and today I was at the
    vegetable gardens on Laan van Meerdervoort again, and saw a
    potato field with a ditch; a man in a blue smock and a woman
    were picking up potatoes, and I put their figures in.[Paintings lost]</p>

    <p>It was a white, sandy field, partly dug up, partly still
    covered with rows of dried stalks, with green weeds in between.
    In the distance, dark green trees and a few roofs.</p>

    <p>I did this last study with special pleasure. I must tell you
    that painting does not seem so strange to me as you would
    perhaps suppose; on the contrary, I like it very much, as it is
    a very strong means of expression. And at the same time one can
    express tender things with it too, let a soft grey or green
    speak amid all the ruggedness.</p>

    <p>I am very glad I have the necessary materials, for already I
    had often suppressed the desire to paint. It opens a much
    broader horizon.</p>

    <p>Now I should prefer to go on making quite a number of
    painted studies, and hang them in my studio without speaking to
    anybody about the change. And in case someone wonders at seeing
    things painted by me, I should say, Did you think that I had no
    sentiment for it, or was unable to do it?</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">But I have attached great value to drawing and will continue
    to do so, because it is the backbone of painting, the skeleton
    that supports all the rest. I like it so much, Theo, that it is
    only because of the expenses that I shall have to restrain
    myself rather than urge myself on. These studies are of medium
    size, a little larger than the cover of an ordinary paintbox,
    because I do not work inside the cover, but thumbtack the paper
    for the study onto a frame which has canvas stretched on it,
    and which I can carry easily in my hand. I will <i>draw</i>
    larger things before I paint them, or I will make grisailles of
    them if I can discover the technique - I will try to find
    it.</label></p>

    <p>It becomes too expensive if one is not economical with the
    paint; but, boy, it is so delightful to have so many new and
    good materials; once more, many, many thanks. I will certainly
    try and take care that you never regret it, but have the
    satisfaction of seeing progress. I write you just this little
    word to tell you I have made a beginning. Of course the studies
    must get even better. I know they have many faults, but I
    believe that in these first ones you will already see something
    of the open air, which proves that I love nature and that I
    have a painter's heart. Enclosed, a small scratch of the Laan
    van Meerdervoort. Those vegetable gardens there have a kind of
    old Dutch character which always appeals to me greatly.</p>

    <p>Well, goodnight, it is already late, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I am reading Zola's La Cur&eacute;e</p>

    <p>When I finished this letter, it seemed to me something was
    missing.</p>

    <p>I thought, I ought to be able to write him that I have started
    to paint a scene of sand, sea and sky like the one we saw
    together at Scheveningen.</p>

    <p>[<art id=251_V-T_2240>A sketch of the work was drawn here.</art>]</p>

    <p>So I kept my letter, and this morning I marched to the beach
    and have just returned from there with a rather large-sized
    <art id=002>painted study of sand, sea and sky, a few fishing smacks, and
    two men on the beach</art>. There is some dune sand
    in it, and I assure you that this will not be the last one. I
    thought you would like to hear that I had started it.</p>

    <p>I repeat, I shall see to it that when you come back in half
    a year or in a few months or a year, the studio will have
    become a painter's studio. These pen-and-ink sketches have been
    made in a great hurry, as you can see. Now that I am making
    some progress, I will try and strike while the iron is hot -
    that means I shall go on painting. If you can send the usual
    amount about the twentieth, I can certainly go on painting for
    some time. I think that after a month of steady painting, the
    studio will have quite a different aspect. Hoping this will
    please you, I shake hands with you again and warmly wish you
    prosperity in everything.</p>
