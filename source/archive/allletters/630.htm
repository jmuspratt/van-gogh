    <p><br>
     My dear brother,</p>

    <p>As M. Peyron returned today, I have read your kind letters,
    and also the letters from home, <label content="health.fatigue">and that has done me an
    enormous amount of good in giving me back a little energy, or
    rather a little desire to climb again out of the present state
    of prostration I am in. </label>Thank you very much for the etchings -
    you have chosen just the ones I have liked for a long time now,
    the &ldquo;David,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Lazarus,&rdquo; the
    &ldquo;Samaritan Woman&rdquo; and the big etching of the
    &ldquo;Wounded,&rdquo; you have added to them the &ldquo;Blind
    Man&rdquo; and the other very little etching, the last one, so
    mysterious that I am afraid of it and do not wish to know what
    it is: I did not know it, the little &ldquo;Goldsmith.&rdquo;<br>
     But the &ldquo;Lazarus&rdquo;! Early this morning I looked at
    it and I remembered not only what Charles Blanc said of it, but
    in fact even everything he didn't say. The unfortunate thing
    about it is that these loafers here are too curious and too
    ignorant of painting for me to practice my profession. The one
    thing we can always claim is that you and I did make an attempt
    here in the same direction as some others, who were understood
    no better and whose hearts were broken by circumstances.<br>
     If ever you go to Montpellier, you will see that what I say
    here is true.<br>
     Now you propose, and I accept, a return to the North instead.<br>
     I have led too hard a life to die of it or to lose the power
    to work.<br>
     So Gauguin and Guillaumin, both of them, want to exchange
    something for <art id=0662>the landscape of the Alps. Well, there are two of
    them</art>, only I think that <art id=0661>the one done last, which I have just
    sent you, is done with more decision and is truer in
    expression</art>. I am perhaps going to try to work from Rembrandt, I
    have especially an idea for doing the &ldquo;Man at
    Prayer,&rdquo; in the scale of colour from light yellow to
    violet.<br>
     Enclosed is Gauguin's letter, do what you think best about the
    exchange, take what you like yourself, I am sure that more and
    more our taste is becoming the same. Oh, if I could have worked
    without this accursed disease - what things I might have done,
    isolated from others, following what the country said to me.
    But there, this journey is over and done with. <label content="feelings.homesick">Anyway, what
    consoles me is the great, the very great desire I have to see
    you again, you and your wife and child, and the many friends
    who remembered me in my misfortune, as indeed I too never cease
    thinking of them.</label><br>
     I am almost certain that in the North I shall get well
    quickly, at least for a fairly long time, even while still
    apprehensive of a relapse in some years' time but not at once.
    That is what I imagine after having observed the other patients
    here, some of whom are considerably older than I, or else in
    their young days were more or less idlers - students. Anyway,
    what do we know about it?<br>
     Fortunately the letters from our sister and from Mother were
    very calm. <label content="attitude.sisters">Our sister wrote extremely well and described a
    landscape or a view of the town in such a way that it might
    have been a page out of a modern novel. I always urge her to
    occupy herself with household matters rather than artistic
    things, for I know that she is already too sensitive, and at
    her age she would find it difficult to develop herself
    artistically. I am much afraid that she also suffers from a
    thwarted artistic desire, but she is so full of vitality that
    she will get over it.</label><br>
     I have talked to M. Peyron about the situation and I told him
    that it was almost impossible for me to endure my lot here, and
    that not knowing at all with any clearness what line to take, I
    thought it preferable to return North.<br>
     <i>If you think well of it and if you mention a date on
    which you would expect me in Paris, I will have
    myself accompanied part of the way, either to Tarascon, or to
    Lyons, by someone from here. Then you can wait for
    me or get someone to wait for me at the station in
    Paris.</i><br>
     Do what seems best to you. I will leave my furniture
    temporarily where it is in Arles. It is with friends, and I am
    sure that they will send it when you want it, but the carriage
    and packing would be almost as much as it is worth. I think of
    it as a shipwreck - this journey. Well, we cannot do what we
    like, nor what we ought to do, either.<label content="art.technique"> As soon as I got out
    into the park, I got back all my lucidity for work; I have more
    ideas in my head than I could ever carry out, but without it
    clouding my mind. The brush strokes come like clockwork.</label> So
    relying on that, I dare think that I shall find my balance in
    the North, once delivered from surroundings and circumstances
    which I do not understand or wish to understand.<br>
     Peyron was very kind to write you, he wrote you again today; I
    leave him regretting that I have to leave him.<br>
     A good handshake for you and Jo, I thank her very much for her
    letter.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
