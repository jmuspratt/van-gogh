    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am writing a line to tell you that on account of the
    arrangement with Father and Mother to let me use the present
    laundry room as a studio and storeroom for my things, I went to
    The Hague to pack up and send off my studies, prints, etc.,
    etc. A thing I must attend to myself.</p>

    <p>I also spent the day with Rappard, who was very cordial, and
    rather reassured me as to some scruples I had regarding the
    possible duration of the arrangement.</p>

    <p>Well, I saw drawings (watercolours) and painted studies of
    his which I thought <i>very good</i>.</p>

    <p>Especially those of the workhouse at Terschelling. What a
    change you would find in his work.</p>

    <p>I have seen the woman again, a thing I had greatly longed
    for.</p>

    <p>I feel that it would indeed be difficult to begin anew. But
    for all that, I do not want to act as if I had forgotten her
    entirely.</p>

    <p>And I wish that Father and Mother would realize that pity is
    not limited in the way the world thinks. You were the one to
    understand me in this matter. She has behaved bravely under the
    circumstances, a reason for me to forget the difficulties I had
    with her at times. And just because I can hardly do anything
    for her now, I must at least try to encourage and fortify
    her.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.women">I see in her a woman, I see in her a mother, and I think
    every man who has the least manliness in him must protect such
    a one if there is an occasion for doing so. I have never been
    ashamed of it, nor ever shall be.</label></p>

    <p>Well, I am writing in a hurry. A handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>My address is: Kosthuis No. 1</p>

    <p>Assendelftstrasse 16</p>

    <p>But of course I shall not stay here long.</p>
