    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>When you were here we spoke about a certain little drawing
    which I would send you, so I then sent you the <art id=951>one of the
    little bench</art>. To show you that I myself
    seriously intend to work on in that style, I am enclosing a few
    little sketches.</p>

    <p>I am doing a watercolour of the flocks of orphans with their
    spiritual shepherds, which probably will not succeed well
    enough to be saleable.</p>

    <p>But to show you that it is not so easy to get some character
    into the figures, and that I am trying hard to overcome this
    difficulty, I am also sending you sketches of figure studies
    which I made recently, and which are of course more elaborate
    than these sketches.</p>

    <p>If I had remained on good terms with Mauve, and had done a
    watercolour like the one of the little bench, or now the one of
    these orphans, I think that he would have pointed something out
    to me which would have made it saleable, and which would have
    given it quite a different aspect.</p>

    <p>It is a fact that many a painter's watercolours or pictures
    are worked up by another painter - and sometimes even
    completely altered.</p>

    <p>That is what I miss now - but though I don't exactly
    disapprove of more experienced painters either making
    suggestions or working it up themselves (especially because it
    is so necessary for the younger ones to earn money in order to
    be able to keep going), I think it is not exactly a misfortune
    to struggle on alone.</p>

    <p>What one learns from personal experience is not learned so
    quickly, but it is imprinted more deeply on the mind.</p>

    <p>I went to see the drawings in the Gothic Hall; I thought the
    ones by Rochussen were splendid. It was a thing from Napoleon's
    time: French officers in an old town hall, who seemed to be
    asking for papers and information from the mayor and town
    council. It was so typical, that little old mayor and then
    those generals, exactly the way Erckmann-Chatrian, for
    instance, describes it in Madame Th&eacute;r&egrave;se. I
    enjoyed it immensely.</p>

    <p>There were also some very beautiful things by Alleb&eacute;
    [Dutch painter], drawings from the Zoological Gardens, and a
    landscape with fir trees on the rocks by the seashore, through
    which one sees a fisherman's cottage in the valley. By
    Hoeterinks there were beautiful town and beach views with small
    figures. But however much I like his current drawings, it seems
    a pity to me that he didn't stick to his origional style, when
    he did characters taken from the people (for instance, a
    picture &ldquo;Le Mont de Pi&eacute;t&eacute;.&rdquo;) [The
    Pawnshop.]</p>

    <p>It is the same with drawing as it is with writing. When a
    child learns to write, it seems almost impossible to him that
    he will ever learn, and seeing the teacher write so quickly
    seems almost like a miracle. But nevertheless, in time every
    child learns. And I really believe one must learn to draw in
    such a way that it becomes as easy as writing, and that one
    must know the proportions as well, and learn to see so
    accurately that one can reproduce whatever one sees on a larger
    or smaller scale.</p>

    <p>We are having very beautiful bad weather here at present,
    rain, wind, thunderstorms, but with splendid effects; that's
    why I like it, but for the rest, it is rather chilly. The time
    for working in the open air is drawing to a close, and the main
    thing is to profit as much as possible before the winter
    comes.</p>

    <p>Toward winter I shall clean up the studio - that is, I shall
    take the studies down from the walls and remove everything that
    takes up too much room - so that I shall have plenty of room to
    work with models. I feel that I need a great many figure
    studies - also of Scheveningen fisherwomen. I should like to
    get some of the studies you have back sometime, the ones you do
    not care to keep (of course, if you have a chance to send
    them). If there is anything you want to keep, if there is
    anything I have here you would like to have, just say so, for I
    consider everything as belonging to you. If I ask it back, it
    is because what is made directly from the model is often
    necessary for watercolours, for instance. But there is no hurry
    - just don't throw them away, even though they are not so very
    well done, for everything may be useful. I do not think I am
    mistaken in believing that being and remaining productive
    depends on the studies one has and continues to make. The more
    variety there is in them, the more one drudges on them, the
    more easily one works later when it comes to making real
    pictures or drawings. In short, I reckon the studies to be the
    seed, and the more one sows, the more one may hope to reap.</p>

    <p>Lately I read Les Deux Fr&egrave;res by Erckmann-Chatrian,
    and I liked it. It must have been a pleasant time when there
    were so many artists in the Alsace - Brion, Marshall, Jundt,
    Vautier, Knaus, Schuler, Saal, Van Muyden and a great many more
    - together with many others who worked in the same line, like
    Chatrian and Auerbach. I myself like them better than
    Tapir&oacute; or Capibianchi, or those hordes of other Italians
    who seem to go on multiplying.</p>

    <p>Adieu, believe me, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
