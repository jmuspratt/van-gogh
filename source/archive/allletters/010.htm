  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter, which was very welcome. I am glad
    you are doing well and that you like living with Mr. Schmidt,
    Mr. Obach was very pleased to have met you. I hope that in the
    future we shall do much business with each other. That picture
    of Linder's is very beautiful.</p>

    <p>As to the photo engravings, I have never seen them being
    made; I know a little about how they are done, but not enough
    to explain.</p>

    <p>At first English art did not appeal to me; one must get used
    to it. But there are clever painters here, among others,
    Millais, who has painted: &ldquo;The Huguenot,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Ophelia,&rdquo; etc., of which I think you know the
    engravings; his things are beautiful. Then there is Boughton,
    whose &ldquo;Puritans Going to Church&rdquo; is in our Galerie
    Photographique; I have seen wonderful things by him. Among the
    old painters, Constable was a landscape painter who lived about
    thirty years ago; he is splendid - his work reminds me of Diaz
    and Daubigny. Then there are Reynolds and Gainsborough, whose
    forte was very beautiful ladies' portraits, and Turner, whose
    engravings you must have seen.</p>

    <p>Some good French painters live here, including Tissot, of
    whose work there are several photographs in our Galerie
    Photographique; and Otto Weber and Heilbuth. The latter is at
    present painting exquisitely beautiful pictures in the manner
    of Linder.</p>

    <p>Sometime you must write me if there are any photographs of
    Wauters's work other than &ldquo;Hugo Van der Goes&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;Mary of Burgundy,&rdquo; and if you know about any
    photographs of pictures by Lagye and De Braekeleer. I don't
    mean the elder Braekeleer, but, I think, a son of his who had
    three beautiful pictures called &ldquo;Antwerp,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;The School&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Atlas&rdquo; at the
    last exhibition in Brussels.</p>

    <p>I am quite contented here; I walk a lot and the neighborhood
    where I live is quiet, pleasant and fresh - I was really very
    lucky to find it.<label content="Feelings.homesick"> Still,
    I often think with regret of the delightful Sundays at
    Scheveningen and other things, but what's
    the use of worrying?</label></p>

    <p>Thanks for what you wrote me about pictures. If you happen
    to see anything by Lagye, De Braekeleer, Wauters, Maris,
    Tissot, George Saal, Jundt, Zeim, or Mauve, you must not forget
    to tell me; those are the painters I am very fond of, and whose
    work you will probably see something of.</p>

    <p>Enclosed is a copy of the poem about the painter who
    &ldquo;entered `The Swan,' the inn where he was lodging,&rdquo;
    which I am sure you remember. It is typical Brabant, and I am
    fond of it. L. copied it for me the last evening I was home
    <sup>1</sup>.</p>

    <p>How I should like to have you here.<label content="Feelings.nostalgia"> What pleasant days we
    spent together at The Hague; I think so often of that walk on
    the Rijswijk road, when we drank milk at the mill after the
    rain. When we send back the pictures we have from you, I will
    send you a picture of that mill by Weissenbruch; perhaps you
    remember him, his nickname is Merry Weiss. <i>That Rijswijk
    road holds memories for me which are perhaps the most beautiful
    I have. If we meet again, maybe we shall talk about them once
    more.</i></label></p>

    <p>And now, boy, I wish you well. Think of me from time to time
    and write me soon, it is such a delight to get a letter.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
