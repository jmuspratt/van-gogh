    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am glad you've been reading Michelet and that you
    understand him so well. If that kind of book teaches us
    anything it is that there is much more to love than people
    generally suppose. To me, that book has been both a revelation
    and a Gospel.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.women">'Il n'y a pas de vielle femme!'[There are no old women.]
    (That does not mean that there are no old women, only that a
    woman does not grow old as long as she loves and is loved.) And
    then a chapter like &ldquo;The Aspirations of Autumn,&rdquo;
    how rich that is &hellip; That a woman is a 'quite different
    being' from a man, and a being that we do not yet know, or at
    best only superficially, as you put it, yes, that I am sure of.
    And that a man and a woman can become one, that is to say, one
    whole and not two halves, I believe that too.</label></p>

    <p>Anna is bearing up well, we go on marvellous walks together.
    It is so beautiful here, if one just has a good and single eye
    without too many beams in it. And if one does have that eye,
    then it is beautiful everywhere.</p>

    <p>Father is far from well, although he and Mother say that
    he's better. <label content="attitude.father">Yesterday we received a letter with all sorts of
    plans (wouldn't we just try this and that) which will prove to
    be unworkable and certainly useless and at the end Father said
    once again that he leaves it all to us, etc., etc. Rather petty
    and disagreeable, Theo, and it reminded me so much of
    Grandfather's letters, but qu'y faire [What can you do?].</label> Our
    beloved Aunts are staying there now and are no doubt doing much
    good! Things are as they are and what can a person do about it,
    as Jong Jochem said.</p>

    <p>Anna and I look at the newspaper faithfully every day and
    reply to whatever advertisements there are. On top of that we
    have already registered with a Governess agency. So we are
    doing what we can. More haste less speed.</p>

    <p>I'm glad that you go round to see the Haanebeeks so often,
    give them all my kindest regards and tell them some of my
    news.</p>

    <p>The painting by Thijs Maris that Mr. Tersteeg has bought
    must be beautiful, I had already heard about it and have myself
    bought and sold one quite similar.</p>

    <p>My interest in drawing has died down here in England, but
    maybe I'll be in the mood again some day or other. Right now I
    am doing a great deal of reading</p>

    <p>On 1st of January 1875 we shall probably be moving to
    another, larger shop. Mr. Obach is in Paris at the moment
    deciding whether or not we should take that other firm over.
    Don't mention it to anybody for the time being.</p>

    <p>Best wishes and write to us again soon. Anna is learning to
    appreciate paintings and has quite a good eye, admiring
    Boughton, Maris and Jacquet already, for instance, so that is a
    good start. <i>Entre nous<b>,</i></b> I think we are going to
    have a difficult time finding something for her, they say
    everywhere that she is too young, and they required German,
    too, but be that as it may, she certainly has a better chances
    here than in Holland. Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>You can imagine how delighted I am to be here together with
    Anna. Tell H. T. [Herman Tersteeg] that the pictures have duly
    arrived and that I shall be writing to him soon.</p>
