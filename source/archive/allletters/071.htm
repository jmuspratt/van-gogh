    <p>C/o Jones Esq., Holme Court</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Your letter and the prints were a delightful surprise; they
    came this morning while I was busy weeding the potatoes in the
    garden. Many thanks; both the engravings, &ldquo;Christus
    Consolator&rdquo; and &ldquo;Remunerator,&rdquo; are hanging
    over the desk in my little room. God is righteous, and He will
    lead all who err onto the right path; you were thinking of that
    when you wrote, &ldquo;May this happen, I am erring in many
    ways, but I don't despair. Do not be unhappy about your
    &ldquo;luxurious&rdquo; life, as you call it; go quietly on
    your way. You are more simple-hearted than I am, and probably
    you will reach your goal quicker and to a greater extent.</p>

    <p>Don't delude yourself about the liberty I have; I am bound
    in different ways, some even humiliating, and these will become
    still worse in time; but the words engraved above the image of
    Christus Consolator, &ldquo;He has come to proclaim liberty to
    the captives&rdquo; are true to this day.</p>

    <p>Now I must ask you something.<label content="feelings.ambition"> While in The Hague I had
    lessons from a Bible teacher, Hille, who then lived in the
    Bagijnestraat. He took great pains over me. Though I didn't
    show it, what he told me made an impression on me, and I should
    like to send him a word and, if possible, do him some small
    favour. Go and visit him if you have a moment and if you can
    find his address, and tell him that I have become a
    schoolmaster and am looking out for some other situation in
    connection with the church.</label> He is a very simple man who, I
    think, has had many struggles in life; involuntarily I
    sometimes thought when looking at him: the end of that man will
    be peace.</p>

    <p>And give him the enclosed little drawing from me.</p>

    <p>How I should like to have a glimpse of Mauve's place; I can
    see distinctly what you described seeing that evening you were
    there.</p>

    <p>Write again soon, best wishes, believe me always,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Give my kind regards to Mr. Tersteeg and his wife and Betsy,
    and the Roos family, and to other friends if you see them. But
    do not speak about me. As you see, I landed in that other
    school after all; enclosed you will find two prospectuses. If
    you can recommend the school to anybody who wants to send his
    boy to England, please do.</p>
