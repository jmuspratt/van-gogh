  <body>
    <p>Dear Father and Mother,</p>

    <p>I received your letter, which made me very happy, as I was
    already looking forward to it, especially because of Father's
    illness. I was glad to hear that there is some improvement.</p>

    <p>I am getting on pretty well with my work, though it is still
    far from perfect, and must become much better still.</p>

    <p>In the studio of that painter I found a very good
    reproduction of a skeleton. As those things are rather
    difficult to get, I asked him if he would lend it to me for a
    few days to copy. At first he raised some objection, probably
    because he thought I could not do it or that it would take me
    too long, but I insisted on having it, and he consented. That
    happened last Sunday afternoon, and as soon as I came home I
    began it; it was finished Monday night, and to his surprise I
    brought it back to him on Tuesday morning. He thought my
    drawing good, and indeed, it is not so bad after all. I shall
    profit more from his instruction if only he has time to spare.
    On some points, especially perspective, he is very well
    informed, and I at least can learn a great deal from him.</p>

    <p>Now I must tell you another thing that I have done. <label content="lifestyle.clothing">As I
    told you, about a month ago I bought a pair of trousers and a
    coat, secondhand. It turned out so well that I bought another
    coat and pair of trousers from the same man. It's true that the
    first suit would have been quite sufficient, but it is much
    better to have two suits because they last longer when one can
    alternate them. Enclosed is a sample of the material. And I
    also had to replenish my underwear with three pairs of drawers,
    and paid 2.75 fr. apiece for them; besides, I bought a pair of
    shoes for 4 fr. </label>The things I bought were really not
    superfluous. But altogether they have made a big hole in this
    month's money, and I shall have to stint myself in consequence,
    especially as I paid 5 fr. to that painter in advance for the
    lessons.</p>

    <p>Do not worry about these expenses, however, and do not
    accuse me of extravagance, for really the contrary is rather my
    fault of character, and if I could spend more, I should get on
    quicker and make more progress. If you can send me something
    extra this month without depriving yourselves, I hope you will.
    But if you cannot, there is no immediate hurry. I told my
    landlord that I should be rather hard up this month, and he
    agreed that I could pay at my convenience because he now knows
    me well enough not to demand my paying in advance, at least not
    for a full month.</p>

    <p>I bought that suit for a reason other than wearing it myself
    as long as possible: when I can wear it no longer, it will
    serve me in another way. For you should know that eventually I
    must have a small collection of workmen's clothes in which to
    dress the models for my drawings. For instance, a Brabant blue
    smock, the grey linen suit that the miners wear and their
    leather hat, then a straw hat and wooden shoes, a fisherman's
    outfit of yellow oilskin and a sou'wester. And certainly also
    that suit of black or brown corduroy which is very picturesque
    and characteristic - and then a red flannel shirt or undervest.
    And also a few women's dresses, for instance, that of De Kempen
    [region in Brabant] and from the neighbourhood of Antwerp,
    along with the Brabant bonnet and, for instance, that of
    Blankenberg, or Scheveningen or Katwijk.</p>

    <p>I certainly do not intend to buy all this at once, but to
    collect it gradually piece by piece, when I have a chance. And
    as those clothes can be bought second-hand, they are not at all
    difficult to get. I shall only be able to manage this well when
    I have some kind of studio of my own.</p>

    <p>Drawing the model with the necessary costumes is the only
    true way to succeed. Only if I study drawing thus seriously and
    thoroughly, always trying to portray truly what I see, shall I
    arrive; and then, notwithstanding the inevitable expenses, I
    shall make a living by it. For a good draughtsman can certainly
    find work nowadays: such persons are in great demand, and there
    are positions that are very well paid. So the thing is to try
    and become as skilled as possible. In Paris many a draughtsman
    earns from 10 to 15 francs a day, and in London and elsewhere
    the same and even more; but one does not reach this at once,
    and I am not so far advanced as yet. But I may become so if I
    have some good luck and can renew relations with persons like
    Mr. Tersteeg and Theo and others, especially with good painters
    and draughtsmen. But I must work and study very hard, that is
    the condition.</p>

    <p>You will not be surprised when I tell you that I am eager to
    hear what Theo's proposition might be, or to hear something
    from Mr. Tersteeg. For one way or the other, before the month
    of March I must know what I can expect and how and where I
    shall be able to work during the spring and summer.</p>

    <p>And if I should gradually succeed in earning something, that
    would not be unpleasant at all, though the principal thing is
    that I make progress and that my drawing becomes stronger -
    then everything will come right sooner or later. Models are
    expensive, at least relatively expensive, and if I had money
    enough to have them often, I should be able to work much
    better. But then a studio becomes indispensable. And people
    like Mr. Tersteeg, Theo, and others know that quite well. Well,
    I must wait until they write me what they think, and meanwhile
    do what I can.</p>

    <p>I made another drawing of miners in the snow which is
    somewhat better than last winter's - there is more character
    and effect in it. I am also collecting wood engravings again,
    like those albums that Theo and Willemien once had. For if I
    can more or less complete the collection, they will be of use
    to me, as it is quite possible that I shall work from wood
    engravings sometime.</p>

    <p>I must tell you that those clothes I bought are well cut and
    look better on me than any others that I can remember. I tell
    you this because you might think they were something unusual or
    showy; this material is often worn in studios especially.</p>

    <p>And now I finish, with greetings to all, and my best wishes
    for A.'s birthday, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>

    <p>The painter who gives me lessons now is making a very good
    picture of a Blankenberg fisherman.</p>
