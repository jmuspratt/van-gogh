  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Herewith some of Copp&eacute;e's poems which I promised to
    send you. &ldquo;Tristement&rdquo; reminds me of a Poplar
    Avenue by Hippolyte Boulanger - I think it is called &ldquo;La
    Vall&eacute;e de Josaphat.&rdquo; How much of an autumn
    atmosphere there is in it! I thought you would admire them too.
    There are many more in the same little volume; I chose only a
    few at random.</p>

    <p>These past few days I have made a number of studies in the
    open air; I am sending you a little sketch of one of them.</p>

    <p>My mother is recovering steadily; the fracture is healed
    now, and the plaster cast has been taken off. But she will
    still have to keep her leg in a horizontal position for about
    six weeks. Yesterday, however, we carried her to the living
    room on a kind of litter as a trial, and later on we shall be
    able to carry her into the open air too once in a while.</p>

    <p>I am adding to Copp&eacute;e's poems an Arabian fable that I
    found this week in an article by De Lesseps, &ldquo;Voyage dans
    le Soudan.&rdquo; I thought the idea subtle, and I believe it
    <i>may</i> be so. Seen from this point of view, human males do
    not play a very noble part - oh well, that may happen too
    sometimes. But in general it won't do, for after all... does
    the candle burn for the moth's sake? If one knew that for
    certain - well - it might be worth while to commit suicide in
    this way.</p>

    <p>But what if the candle itself should snigger at the burned
    wings...?</p>

    <p>I was struck by it, whatever the truth of it may be. And - I
    firmly believe that there are things like that in the depths of
    our souls - and that they would cut us to the quick if we knew
    about them. At times we are quite disenchanted by mankind - our
    own selves included, of course - and yet - seeing that we are
    going to pop off soon enough after all - it would hardly be
    worth while to stick to our displeasure, even if it were well
    founded.</p>

    <p>And in case our ideas about the worthlessness of mankind
    were unfounded, our mistake would be all the worse for us. In
    my opinion the worst evil of all evils is self-righteousness,
    and exterminating it in ourselves is an everlasting weeding
    job...all the more difficult for us Dutchmen, as so often our
    very education must induce us inevitably to become highly
    self-righteous. But let's stop harping on the subject.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">I repeat that my idea about my drawings, and the reason I
    asked you to show them to people if you have a chance, is based
    on circumstances which are to a great extent not my fault - I
    am reproached quite often with &ldquo;not selling
    anything.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup> I am asked quite often,
    &ldquo;Why do others <i>sell</i> and you don't?&rdquo; I answer
    that I certainly hope to sell in the course of time, but that I
    think I shall be able to influence it most effectively by
    working steadily on, and that at the present moment making
    desperate &ldquo;efforts&rdquo; to force the work I am doing
    now upon the public would be pretty useless - and consequently
    that the problem leaves me rather cold, as I am concentrating
    on getting on. But all the same, because I am so often
    reproached with it, and because I am so often hard pressed to
    make both ends meet, I must not fail to do anything that gives
    me the slightest chance to sell something. But, I repeat, as a
    matter of course I am reconciled to the fact that it won't
    succeed all at once.</label></p>

    <p>But, speaking for myself, this showing of my work to others
    once in a while is something that stimulates me, now that I
    have started to do so (perhaps it is very foolish of me).</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
