    <p>Many particulars of his stay in Antwerp and the work Vincent
    made there are contained in the solid dissertation by Doctor
    Mark Edo Tralbaut, published under the title <i>Vincent van
    Gogh in zijn Antwerpse Periode</i> (V. v. G. in his Antwerp
    period) by A. J. G. Strengholt's Publishing Company, Amsterdam,
    1948.</p>

    <p>The following details are reprinted from this book, with the
    exception of an interview with Hageman, which is reprinted - as
    it is by Dr. Tralbaut too - from Louis Pierard's <i>La vie
    tragique de Vincent van Gogh,</i> Editions Correa &amp; Cie,
    Paris, 1939<b>.</b></p>

    <p>Vincent arrived in Antwerp on November 27 or 28, 1885. He
    lived in Beeldekensstraat (Rue des Images, Little Images
    Street!) at No. 194, now [i.e. in 1952] changed to 224 Lange
    Beeldekensstraat. On January 18, 1886, he was entered at the
    academy (Tralbaut reproduces a facsimile of the register).
    Karel Verlat, the director, saw Vincent's work and admitted
    him. He followed the evening classes led by Eugene Siberdt
    <sup>1</sup> for drawing after the live model, and those led by
    Frans Vinck for the drawing of ornaments. Moreover, he
    participated in the day classes led by Piet van Havermaet, for
    drawing from life and antique subjects.</p>

    <p>Vincent drew at two evening clubs, apart from the academy.
    Tralbaut says of this, on pp. 171-172 of his book:</p>

    <p>As Richard Baseleer [note: Richard Baseleer was a well-known
    marine painter, a contemporary of Vincent's] confided to us,
    one day the whole painting class went on strike - not exactly
    an everyday sort of strike, this! - because Verlat, whom the
    pupils liked very much notwithstanding, was always giving them
    the same models. As a result of this &ldquo;palace
    revolution,&rdquo; a studio was fitted up in what is now
    &ldquo;Winkler's House&rdquo; in the High Market. And ... it is
    quite possible, so Baseleer asserted, that it was in this very
    studio that Levens painted the portrait of Vincent, a
    reproduction of which was published in <i>Van Nu en Straks</i>
    [<i>The Present and Presently</i>]. He was unable to prove
    this, but the statement appeared to rest on a strong
    impression.</p>

    <p>By the way, let it be mentioned in passing that Vincent made
    a picture of the so-called &ldquo;Winkler's House&rdquo; when,
    during his stay on the banks of the Scheldt, he did a drawing
    of the High Market (Grote Markt), with the Cathedral tower in
    the background.</p>

    <p>The stinginess with models also found expression in another
    field, namely the study from the nude, the very object of
    Vincent's quest.</p>

    <p>According to Richard Baseleer the pupils were not allowed to
    paint or draw from the completely nude model, at least not in
    the day classes; on the other hand, it was permitted in the
    evening, but in that case never from a female specimen! The
    utmost limit of propriety and moral decency, which it was under
    no circumstances allowed to overstep, was the head of a woman,
    but never a torso!</p>

    <p>However, in the clubs, mostly got up by the students of the
    higher classes, they were free in the choice of their models.
    In his correspondence Vincent called them &ldquo;drawing
    clubs,&rdquo; whereas the Antwerp people were in the habit of
    calling them &ldquo;sketching clubs.&rdquo; Not the faintest
    trace could be found of a regulated organization. At the end
    of the week each member paid his share of the expenses, which
    were strictly limited to the remuneration of the models, for
    they got the room &ldquo;free for nothing,&rdquo; as the
    members drank a pint of beer each every evening.</p>

    <p>At the time Baseleer was also a member of a drawing club,
    which was located in Reynders Street, and which owed its
    existence to the reaction against&hellip;Siberdt, with the
    object of getting a free choice of models. Seeing that Vincent
    mentions two drawing clubs, where he went to work in the
    evening, it is not impossible, on the contrary it is highly
    probable, that these two clubs were the sketching clubs here
    described. However, this is not absolutely certain, and seeing
    that these clubs were not organized in the accepted sense of
    the word and therefore possessed neither registers of members
    nor records of the proceedings, nor cash books, one may
    suppose there is little chance of discovering new evidence in
    any records that may yet be unearthed.</p>

    <p>Because of Vincent's membership in two such clubs, he at
    last fulfilled his ardent wish, for which his artist's soul had
    been craving painting from the nude.</p>

    <p>As to Vincent's entrance into the academy, Richard Baseleer,
    who was also present, told Tralbaut the following details
    <i>(see</i> Tralbaut, pp. 138 - 139):</p>

    <p>Both the drawing and the painting class were housed in the
    covered courtyard, but they were separated by a wooden
    partition. One-third of the space was reserved for the drawing
    class, the remaining two-thirds at the disposal of the painting
    class. As a result of this arrangement, one was obliged to
    cross the whole painting class in order to reach the drawing
    class.</p>

    <p>Considered apart, this was a decidedly unfortunate solution
    of the ticklish problem of the <i>Lebenstraum</i>, at least as
    far as the youthful draftsmen and painters of the Antwerp
    academy were concerned. But the acme of what may be looked upon
    as a miniature babel of confusion was reached every time there
    was an interval between the lessons, for then the whole crowd
    of young people would swarm about, like a disturbed anthill, in
    bustling tumult. True, there was a kind of supervisor to
    maintain order among Mr. Verlat's pupils, and, in his absence,
    of Mr. Havermaet's, in the shape of a retired Flemish gendarme,
    who felt obliged to jabber at all costs some sort of lingo,
    which he himself took to be French, and which for instance
    would culminate in his favourite repartee: &ldquo;Moi, je
    frotte ma cu &agrave; toutes vos blagueries! [I wipe my
    ass with all your humbug.]</p>

    <p>But on the day when Vincent came rushing in like a bull in a
    china shop, and at once began to spread all over the floor a
    roll of studies that he had brought under his arm - to the
    uninitiated an extremely eccentric method, but in the world of
    artists a highly normal way of exhibiting work for professional
    inspection - the one-time gendarme was wholly incapable of
    exercising his, under other circumstances already dubious,
    authority.</p>

    <p>They all formed a jostling crowd around the newly-arrived
    Dutchman, who looked more like an itinerant oilcloth merchant,
    unfurling and unfolding at the bargain market his cheap
    remnants of extra-pliable tablecloths than like an artist - not
    to mention the now world-famous master, who at that moment was
    already through with the Nuenen episode, with the universally
    admired &ldquo;Potato Eaters.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, it was a funny spectacle! And don't ask me if there
    was an uproar in consequence! The majority of the young fellows
    split their sides with laughter. Richard Baseleer distinctly
    remembered that the Englishman Pimm, who instructed his
    colleagues in the art of boxing, the Dutchman Briette, and also
    the Antwerp artist Karel Berckmans, who later sang the part of
    Tamino in Mozart's <i>Magic Flute</i> and other star parts of
    the light tenor repertoire, all attended the painting
    class.</p>

    <p>Very soon the news spread like wildfire all over the
    building complex that some sort of savage had dropped in, and
    people looked round at Vincent as if he were a rare specimen
    out of a collection of human freaks belonging to some traveling
    circus.</p>

    <p>However, Vincent himself did not perceive this, or rather
    behaved as if he did not, for a man with such acute powers of
    observation as his could hardly have failed to notice it, and
    later on he withdrew into that stoical taciturnity that soon
    gained him a reputation for self-centeredness.</p>

    <p>On another occasion Van Baseleer gave the following
    description of Vincent's arrival at the academy (in an
    interview by Charles Bernard in the Antwerp paper <i>Le
    Matin</i> of November 13, 1927, Tralbaut, p. 140):</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.appearance">And there Van Gogh appeared on the scene - the Van Gogh, who
    was the spitting image of the portrait the Englishman Levens
    made of him, and which was reproduced in the first number of
    <i>The Present and Presently.</i> A flat, pink head with yellow
    hair, an angular mask, a pointed nose, a short pipe stuck in
    the midst of a tough, ill-cut beard.</label> Van Gogh unfurls his
    drawings, at which we look with something like a shuddering
    terror, and immediately afterward starts painting the nude
    model, who at that moment appears before the class.</p>

    <p>Tralbaut publishes a reproduction of the official records of
    the session of the academy's Board of Governors, at which
    Vincent was relegated to a lower class (it was said that he
    could not draw, although he had already painted the
    &ldquo;Potato Eaters&rdquo;).We find in Pi&eacute;rard's
    book what Piet van Havermaet told him on this point.</p>

    <p>[Pi&eacute;rard, pp. 155-159] On the subject of
    Van Gogh's arrival at the academy in Antwerp, here are the
    reminiscences noted down from the lips of Mr. Victor Hageman
    (who died in October, 1938).</p>

    <p>At the time I was a pupil in the drawing class. There were
    only a few weeks left until the end of the course. I remember
    quite well that weather-beaten, nervous, restless man who
    crashed like a bombshell into the Antwerp academy, upsetting
    the director, the drawing master and the pupils.</p>

    <p>Van Gogh, who was then thirty-one years old, first went into
    the painting class taught by Verlat, the director of the
    academy, the perfect type of the official painter, whose duty
    it was to transmit to posterity, by means of the interpretative
    realizations of the art of painting, memories of great
    patriotic solemnities. One morning Van Gogh came into the
    class, in which there were about sixty pupils, more than a
    dozen of whom were German or English; <label content="lifestyle.clothing">he was dressed in a kind
    of blue blouse, of the type usually worn by the Flemish cattle
    dealers, and he wore a fur cap on his head.</label> In place of a
    regular palette be used a board torn from a packing case that
    had contained sugar and yeast. On that day the pupils had to
    paint two wrestlers, who were posed on the platform, stripped
    to the waist.</p>

    <p>Van Gogh started painting feverishly, furiously, with a
    rapidity that stupefied his fellow students. &ldquo;He laid on
    his paint so thickly,&rdquo; Mr. Hageman told us, &ldquo;that
    his colors literally dripped from his canvas on to the
    floor.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When Verlat saw this work and its extraordinary creator, he
    asked in Flemish, in a tone of voice that showed how dumfounded
    he was, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Van Gogh replied quietly, &ldquo;Well, I am Vincent, a
    Dutchman.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then the very academic director proclaimed contemptuously,
    while pointing at the newcomer's canvas, &ldquo;1 won't correct
    such putrefied dogs. My boy, go to the drawing class
    quickly.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Van Gogh, whose cheeks had gone purple, restrained his
    anger, and fled to the course of good Mr. Sieber (<i>sic</i>),
    who was also frightened by the novel phenomenon, but who had a
    less irascible temperament than his director.</p>

    <p>Vincent stayed there for some weeks, drawing zealously,
    taking great pains, and visibly suffering under his efforts to
    grasp the vigour of the subject, working rapidly, without
    making corrections, more often than not tearing up the drawing
    he had just finished, or else throwing it down behind him. He
    made sketches of everything that was to be found in the hall:
    of the students, of their clothes, of the furniture, while
    forgetting the plaster cast the professor had given him to
    copy. Already everybody marvelled at the rapidity with which he
    worked, as he did the same drawing or painting over again ten
    or fifteen times.</p>

    <p>One day, in the drawing class of the academy of Antwerp,
    they gave the students (as if by accident) a cast of the Venus
    de Milo to copy. Van Gogh, who evidently was struck by one of
    the essential characteristics of the model, strongly
    accentuated the breadth of the hips, and made Venus the victim
    of the same disfigurements he introduced into &ldquo;The
    Sower&rdquo; by Millet, or &ldquo;The Good Samaritan&rdquo; by
    Delacroix, other pictures that he was to copy in the course of
    his career. The beautiful Greek goddess had become a robust
    Flemish matron. When honest Mr. Sieber saw this, he tore Van
    Gogh's drawing sheet with the furious corrective strokes of his
    crayon, reminding his disciple of the inviolable canons of his
    art.</p>

    <p>Then the young Dutchman, rustic <i>(sic!)</i> of the Danube
    <i>(sic!)</i> (or of the Lower Meuse) whose rudeness had
    terrified the fair clients of Goupil's at Paris, flew into a
    violent passion, and roared at his professor, who was scared
    out of his wits: &ldquo;So you don't know what a young woman is
    like, God damn you! A woman must have hips and buttocks and a
    pelvis in which she can hold a child!&rdquo;... This was the
    last lesson Van Gogh took - or gave - at the Antwerp academy.
    He had made some staunch friends among the pupils there,
    especially among the English, such as Levens. (The latter was
    the man who painted the portrait of Vincent that was later
    published in the magazine The <i>Present and
    Presently.)</i></p>

    <p>With those who understood him, who had an inkling of his
    growing genius, he showed himself communicative, enthusiastic,
    fraternal. Very often he spoke to them about those rough and
    kind-hearted miners of the Borinage, whom he had catechized and
    cared for and helped and nursed with so much love. During the
    tragic strikes of 1886 he even wanted to go back to that Black
    Country.</p>

    <p>The above was confirmed by Emanuel de Bom in an article
    published in the Rotterdam newspaper <i>Nieuwe Rotterdamse
    Courant</i> of November 3, 1938, in which he quotes a letter
    written by Victor Hageman. In this may be found (Tralbaut,
    p.154):</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He was told to do a drawing of the Venus de
    Milo,&rdquo; De Bom writes. &ldquo;He was of the opinion that
    `that woman must have hips,' and he gave her very un-Grecian
    ones, they were `<i>comme &ccedil;a'</i> ! The drawing
    master (I will not mention his name - moreover, he is dead now)
    sent Van Gogh down to a lower class, and there Vincent, who
    scorned nothing, did drawings of `noses and ears.'</p>

    <p>And Baseleer told Charles Bernard in the interview already
    quoted that Vincent was reported to have said of the Venus de
    Milo: &ldquo;Fine female, nice hips.&rdquo; And he
    continues:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I can still see before me that thickset Venus with an
    enormous pelvis, that extraordinary, fat-buttocked figure which
    had issued from Vincent's drawing pencil. Antiquity as seen by
    Rembrandt, Greece through the medium of a distorting windowpane
    on the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Doctor Tralbaut describes in detail how Rubens's pictures
    induced Vincent to paint his portraits in lighter tones than in
    Nuenen; those who are interested in the subject are referred to
    his book.</p>

    <p>1. Vincent invariably spelled the name <i>Sibert.</i></p>
