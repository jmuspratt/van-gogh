    <p>Memoirs of Vincent Van Gogh's stay in Auvers-sur-Oise.
    (1956)</p>

    <p>By Adeline Ravoux (aged 76)</p>

    <p>Vincent Van Gogh arrived at our place at the end May 1890; I
    cannot be more specific on the date from memory. It is claimed
    that before this he stayed briefly at the hotel Saint Aubin
    when he arrived in Auvers, but I never heard him speak of it.
    You have been able to see the small bedroom that he lived in
    with us, <i>on the second floor</i>, the room whose door faces
    the staircase. Having gone to Auvers on 7<sup>th</sup> May
    last, I rectified errors that the current manager made on this
    subject, with respect to the bedroom on the first floor that he
    had never occupied. The room in the lobby where he painted (the
    &ldquo;artists room&rdquo; as we had called it) still exists,
    although reduced by a corridor. I have given an account of my
    trip to Auvers, which was published in <i>Les Nouvelles
    Litt&eacute;raires</i> of 12 August 1954.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">Of his dress, I remember only a blue drill jacket, shorter
    than an ordinary jacket, which he wore constantly. He did not
    wear either collar or tie. For headgear, he wore a felt hat
    with large flaps, and when the sun shone a straw hat like those
    worn by gardeners or fishermen. Overall his appearance was
    neglected.</label></p>

    <p>He was a man of good build, one shoulder slightly leaning on
    the side of his wounded ear, a very penetrating glance, gentle
    and calm, but not a very communicative character. When one
    spoke to him, he always replied with an agreeable smile. He
    spoke French very correctly, hunting a bit for his words. <i>He
    never drank alcohol</i>. I insist on this point. The day of his
    suicide, he was not in the least intoxicated, as some claim.
    When I later learnt that he had been interned in an asylum for
    lunatics in the Midi, I was very surprised, as he always
    appeared calm and gentle in Auvers. He was well respected at
    our place. We called him familiarly &ldquo;Monsieur
    Vincent&rdquo;. He never mixed with the clients of the
    caf&eacute;.</p>

    <p>He took his meals with our two other boarders, who were
    Tommy Hirschig (we called him Tom familiarly) and Martinez de
    Valdivielse. Tommy Hirschig was a Dutch painter, to me he
    seemed twenty-three or twenty-four years old; he arrived at
    ours a bit after Van Gogh. He knew very little French and
    continued to speak it badly for a long time, with vocabulary
    mistakes that provoked foolish laughter. He was a bright lad,
    not much of a worker, more preoccupied with beautiful girls
    than painting. His relationship with Vincent seemed to have
    been superficial. It was difficult to follow their
    conversation, because they spoke in Dutch. Vincent did not seem
    to take him very seriously. Hirschig left our house in Auvers a
    short while after the death of Van Gogh. I think, for my part,
    that it was our low rent (3,50 Francs per day) that attracted
    Van Gogh to us. In any case, it certainly was not Dr. Gachet
    who bought him. We had no relationship with this physician,
    <i>who I had never seen at our place before the death of
    Vincent.</i></p>

    <p>Martinez de Valdivielse was a Spanish etcher exiled from his
    homeland for his Carlist opinions. He received large subsidies
    from his family. Martinez had a house in Auvers and only took
    his meals with us. He was a big handsome man with a long
    grizzled brown beard, with a profile as on a medal. Very
    vibrant and nervous, he strode the house from one end to the
    other. He expressed himself very well in French and was happy
    to speak to Father, whom he well respected. The first time that
    he saw a canvas of Van Gogh, with his usual fire he cried:
    &ldquo;What pig made that?&rdquo; Vincent, standing behind his
    easel replied with his usual calm: &ldquo;It is me,
    Monsieur.&rdquo; This is how they met one another.</p>

    <p>They hit it off quite well and had long moving
    conversations, especially on art and artists that they knew,
    one expressing himself with fire and enthusiasm, the other with
    tranquillity. I do not think that Martinez really appreciated
    the painting of Van Gogh. Vincent does not in speak of him in
    his letters, at least in those that have been bought to the
    public knowledge. In the Van Gogh correspondence, he does not
    name Dr. Gachet among his relationships. But I believe that the
    legend that suggests that Vincent went to dinner there every
    Sunday and Monday is probably false, or at least strongly
    exaggerated, because I have no memory of repeated absences of
    M. Vincent at mealtimes which he regularly took with us. In
    fact, I am convinced that there were no intimate relationships
    between the doctor and the artist. That is a problem on which
    scholars will have to work.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">The menu was that served during the period in restaurants:
    meat, vegetables, salad, dessert. I do not remember M. Vincent
    having any food preference. He never refused a dish.</label> He was not
    a difficult boarder. The question of religion was never raised
    in our house. We never saw Vincent Van Gogh either in church or
    at the priest's house. I never knew any Protestants in Auvers.
    Vincent did not visit anybody in the village, to the best of my
    knowledge. He had few conversations with us. Father, who had
    been established in Auvers only a few months before the arrival
    of Vincent, was then forty-two years old. He did not hold a
    conversation on art and did not discuss with him any material
    questions.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, Vincent had attached himself to my little
    sister Germaine (today Mrs. Guilloux, who lives with me). She
    was then a baby; two years old. Every evening, following the
    meal, he took her on his knees, and drew <i>The Sandman</i> for
    her on a slate: a horse harnessed to a cart, in which the
    sandman stood upright, throwing sand by the handful. Following
    this the little girl kissed everyone and went to bed.</p>

    <p>Vincent had not spoken to me before he did my portrait,
    other than for some polite words. One day, he asked me:
    &ldquo;Would it please you if I did your portrait?&rdquo; He
    appeared to really want to. I accepted and he asked my parents'
    permission. I was then thirteen years, but to some I appeared
    sixteen. He did <art id=0768>my portrait</art> in an afternoon, in one sitting.
    During the sitting Vincent did not say a word to me; he smoked
    his pipe non-stop.</p>

    <p>He found me very well behaved and complimented me for not
    having moved. I was not tired, but it amused me to see him
    paint and I was very proud to pose for my portrait. Dressed in
    blue, I was sitting on a chair. A blue ribbon held my hair. I
    have blue eyes. He used blue for the background of the
    portrait: it was therefore a <i>Symphony in Blue</i>. M.
    Vincent also made <art id=0769>a copy in a square format</art> that he sent to his
    brother, as he indicates in one of his letters. I did not see
    him do this copy. There is also <art id=0786>a third portrait of me</art>. I don't
    know this last.</p>

    <p>What I wish to emphasize is that I only posed for one
    portrait. I confess that I was only poorly satisfied with my
    portrait, that I was even disappointed: I did not see a
    resemblance. Nevertheless, last year, someone who came to see
    me to talk about Van Gogh: the first time that they met me they
    recognized me from this portrait that Vincent had done and
    added: &ldquo;This is not the youthful girl that you were that
    Vincent saw, but the woman that you would become.&rdquo;
    Neither of my parents really appreciated this painting, nor did
    anyone else that saw it then. At this time very few people
    understood the paintings of Van Gogh. We kept this picture
    until 1905, I believe, as well as that representing <art id=0790>the Town
    Hall of Auvers</art> that Vincent had offered to Father. Again I saw
    Vincent paint this last canvas, on our sidewalk in front of the
    cafe: it was 14<sup>th</sup>. July; the town hall was decked
    out and there was a garland of lanterns around the trees.</p>

    <p>After fifteen years, the paint on these canvases started
    flaking. We were then in Meulan. Across from our
    caf&eacute; was the Hotel Pinchon, where some artists
    were lodging; there were two Americans, Harry Harronson who
    also lived in Paris, rue du March&eacute; au Beurre, no.
    2, I believe, and, in Meulan, the other was nicknamed &ldquo;Le
    petit p&eacute;re Sam&rdquo; [little father Sam]; there
    was also a German and a Dutchman who claimed to be of the Van
    Gogh family. They knew that Father possessed two works by Van
    Gogh.</p>

    <p>They asked to see them, and then later insisted that Father
    give them these canvases, because, they said &ldquo;The paint
    is damaged and it is necessary to give them special
    care.&rdquo; Faced by the threat of seeing these paintings
    deteriorating, Father told them: &ldquo;Huh! Well, give me ten
    Francs each.&rdquo; Thus it is that these paintings of Vincent
    Van Gogh were given up for forty francs: <i>The Woman in
    Blue</i> and <i>The Town Hall of Auvers on 14 July</i>.</p>

    <p>Van Gogh filled his days in an almost uniform way: He took
    his breakfast, then at nine he left for the countryside with
    his easel and his artist's box, always with his pipe in his
    mouth: he was going to paint. He returned punctually at noon
    for lunch. In the afternoon, he often worked on a painting in
    progress, in &ldquo;the painters room.&rdquo; Sometimes he
    worked there until dinner, sometimes he went out for four hours
    until the evening meal. After dinner he played with my little
    sister, drawing her <i>the Sandman</i>, then he immediately
    went up to his bedroom. I never saw him write in the cafe: I
    think that he wrote in the evening in his bedroom.</p>

    <p>Here is what I know on his death.</p>

    <p>That Sunday he went out immediately after breakfast, which
    was unusual. At dusk he had not returned, which surprised us
    very much, for he was extremely correct in his relationship
    with us, he always kept regular meal hours. We were then all
    sitting out on the caf&eacute; terrace, for on Sunday the
    hustle was more tiring than on weekdays. When we saw Vincent
    arrive night had fallen, it must have been about nine o'clock.
    Vincent walked bent, holding his stomach,<label content="lifestyle.appearance"> again exaggerating
    his habit of holding one shoulder higher than the other.</label> Mother
    asked him: &ldquo;M. Vincent, we were anxious, we are happy to
    see you to return; have you had a problem?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He replied in a suffering voice: &ldquo;No, but I
    have&hellip;&rdquo; he did not finish, crossed the hall, took
    the staircase and climbed to his bedroom. I was witness to this
    scene. Vincent made such a strange impression on us that Father
    got up and went to the staircase to see if he could hear
    anything.</p>

    <p>He thought he could hear groans, went up quickly and found
    Vincent on his bed, laid down in a crooked position, knees up
    to the chin, moaning loudly: &ldquo;What's the matter,&rdquo;
    said Father, &ldquo;are you ill?&rdquo; Vincent then lifted his
    shirt and showed him a small wound in the region of the heart.
    Father cried: &ldquo;Malheureaux, [unhappy man] what have you
    done?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have tried to kill myself,&rdquo; replied Van
    Gogh.</p>

    <p>These words are precise, our father retold them many times
    to my sister and I, because for our family the tragic death of
    Vincent Van Gogh has remained one of the most prominent events
    of our life. In his old age, Father became blind and gladly
    aired his memories, and the suicide of Vincent was the one that
    he told the most often and with great precision.</p>

    <p>In parenthesis here, I want to clear up any doubt about the
    fidelity of Father's memory, which was prodigious. He sometimes
    told clients of our cafe his memories of the war of 1870. This
    was bought to the knowledge of a chronicler of the <i>Petit
    Parisien</i>, a specialist in historical questions - he was
    called M. Saint -Yves, I believe - and the former verified
    Father's accounts; all the details that he gave were confirmed:
    he was never caught out with an error from his lips.</p>

    <p>The value of Father's testimony being thus well established,
    I continue the account of his memories on the death of the
    great painter. I must confess that the manner in which some
    biographers have spoken to me of Father has shocked me. Father
    was not a vulgar man. His reputation of honesty was proverbial:
    he was not called &ldquo;Father Ravoux&rdquo; for nothing. He
    commanded respect.</p>

    <p>I continue therefore the account of the confidences that
    Vincent Van Gogh made to Father in the course of the night of
    Sunday to Monday that he spent with him.</p>

    <p>Vincent had gone to the wheat field where he had painted
    previously, it was situated behind the Auvers chateau, and then
    belonged to Mr. Gosselin who resided in Paris, rue de Messine.
    The chateau was more than a half-kilometer from our house. It
    was reached by going up a steep hill, shaded by large trees. We
    do not know how far he got from the chateau. In the course of
    the afternoon, on the road that passes under the chateau wall -
    so my father understood - Vincent shot himself with a revolver
    and fainted. The freshness of the evening revived him. On all
    fours he sought the revolver to finish himself off, but could
    not find it (and it was not found the following day). Then
    Vincent gave up looking and came down the hill to regain our
    house.</p>

    <p>I never, obviously, assisted at the agony of Van Gogh, but I
    was witness to most of what happened, which I am going to
    relate now.</p>

    <p>After seeing his injury in the region of the heart, Father
    descended rapidly from the bedroom where Vincent groaned and he
    asked Tom Hirschig to go in search of a physician. In Auvers
    there was a physician from Pontoise who had a pied-a-terre
    where he gave consultations. This physician was absent. Father
    sent then Tom to Dr.Gachet who resided in the upper part of the
    town, but did not practice in Auvers.</p>

    <p>What was Dr.Gachet's connection with Van Gogh? Father
    ignored him completely, the physician had never come to the
    house, and the scene in which my father assisted did not to
    make him suppose any existed, in fact on the contrary.</p>

    <p>After the physician's visit, Father told us: &ldquo;Dr.
    Gachet has examined Mr. Vincent and has dressed his wound with
    bandages that he had himself brought&rdquo; (someone had warned
    him that it concerned a casualty). He judged the case hopeless
    and left immediately. I am absolutely certain that he did not
    return: neither that evening, nor the following day. Father
    told us again: <i>&ldquo;During the examination and when he was
    bandaging the wound, Dr. Gachet did not say a word to M.
    Vincent.&rdquo;</i></p>

    <p>After escorting the physician home, Father went up to M.
    Vincent and he stayed all night. Tom Hirschig remained near
    him.</p>

    <p>Before the arrival of the physician, Vincent had requested
    his pipe and Father had lit it. He resumed smoking after the
    departure of the doctor, and smoked thus a part of the night.
    He appeared to suffer a lot and often moaned. He asked Father
    to put his ear to his chest to see if he could hear the
    gurgling of the internal hemorrhage. He remained silent almost
    all the night, sometimes dozing.</p>

    <p>In the morning of the following day, two gendarmes of the
    M&eacute;ry brigade, probably alerted by a public rumour,
    appeared at the house. One of them, called Rigaumon, questioned
    Father in an unpleasant tone: &ldquo;It is here that there has
    been a suicide?&rdquo; Father, after begging him to soften his
    manners, invited him to climb up to the bedridden man. He
    preceded the gendarme into the bedroom, explaining to Vincent
    that in this case that the gendarmes were here as French law
    prescribed an inquiry. The gendarme then entered the room, and
    Rigaumon, always in the same tone, questioned Vincent:
    &ldquo;Are you the one who wanted to commit suicide?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>- Yes, I believe, replies Vincent in his usual soft
    tone.</p>

    <p>- You know that you do not have the right?</p>

    <p>Always in the same even tone Van Gogh replied:
    &ldquo;Gendarme, my body is mine and I am free to do what I
    want with it. Do not accuse anybody, it is I that wished to
    commit suicide.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Father then asked the gendarme, a bit sharply, not to insist
    any more.</p>

    <p>Since dawn, Father had been preoccupied with how to tell
    Theo, the brother of Vincent. The casualty then being lethargic
    could not give precise information. (He had had a burst of
    energy during the gendarme's visit that had tired him a lot.)
    But, knowing that Vincent's brother was a salesman at the Art
    Gallery of Boussod Valadon, boulevard Montmartre, in Paris,
    Father sent a telegram to this address when the post office
    opened. Theo arrived by train in the middle of the afternoon. I
    remember seeing him arrive, running. The station was close
    enough to us. He was a man a little smaller than Vincent, thin,
    an agreeable physiognomy and he appeared very nice. But his
    face was marked by sorrow. He immediately climbed up to his
    brother who he kissed and spoke to him in their native
    language. Father withdrew and did not help them. He did not go
    back in during the night. After the emotion that he had felt on
    seeing his brother, Vincent had fallen into a coma. Theo and my
    father kept watch on the casualty until his death, which
    occurred at one o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>It was Father who, with Theo, in the morning made the
    declaration of the death to the town hall.</p>

    <p>The house was in mourning as if for the death of one of our
    own. The door of the cafe remained opened but the shutters were
    closed in front. In the afternoon, after the bier was set out ,
    the body was bought down to &ldquo;the painters
    room.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Tom had gone to pick greenery to decorate the room, and Theo
    had had placed canvases that Vincent had left there all around:
    <i>The church of Auvers, Irises, The Garden of Daubigny, The
    child with an orange</i>, etc. At the foot of the coffin his
    palette and brushes were laid out. Our neighbor, Mr. Levert,
    the carpenter, had lent the trestles. The child of this latter,
    two years old, had been painted by Van Gogh in the painting
    <i>The child with an orange</i>.</p>

    <p>It was also Mr. Levert who made the coffin.</p>

    <p><i>Les Nouvelles litt&eacute;raires</i> has published
    a photograph of our house in Auvers where one can see Father,
    my sister Germaine, the Levert child and myself.</p>

    <p>The internment took place two days later after the death, in
    the afternoon. About twenty artists followed the body to the
    village cemetery. Father was there as well as Tom and Martinez
    and neighbors who, each day, saw M. Vincent when he went to
    paint.</p>

    <p>On the return, Theo, Tom, Dr.Gachet and the latter's son,
    Paul, who may have then been sixteen, accompanied Father. They
    entered &ldquo;the painters room&rdquo; where the coffin left
    from and where the canvases were on display. Theo, wanting to
    thank those that had helped his brother, offered them to take
    some canvases in memory of the departed artist. Father was
    content with my portrait and the Town Hall of Auvers that M.
    Vincent had given him when he was alive. When the proposal was
    made to Dr.Gachet, the former chose many canvases and passed
    them to his son Paul: &ldquo;Roulez Coco,&rdquo; [Roll `em up,
    Coco] telling him to make a parcel. Then Theo took my sister
    Germaine to choose a toy: this was a basket of intertwined
    shavings containing a small set of iron kitchen utensils.
    Finally, Theo took his brother's belongings. We never saw him
    again.</p>

    <p>Later, we learnt that he had fallen gravely ill almost
    immediately after the suicide of his brother and that he was
    dead some months after. His body was returned to Auvers where
    it is interred next to his brother. What were the motives for
    the suicide of Vincent?</p>

    <p>Here is what Father thought: Theo had a little boy and
    Vincent adored his nephew. He feared that his married brother,
    having further expenses, could no longer finance him as he had
    up to then. This is the motive that Theo expressed to Father
    and he told him that the last letter written by Vincent was in
    this sense. It has been published as No. 652 in the series of
    <i>Letters of Vincent to Theo</i>; has it been published in its
    entirety? The motive of the suicide is not discernable in the
    letter.</p>

    <p>On this confidence on Vincent's embarrassment of money, made
    by Theo to Father, one finds no trace in the letters, which
    tends to make me think that there are gaps in the publication
    of these letters. Does the correspondence of Vincent Van Gogh
    pose problems that someone wanted to avoid?</p>

    <p>His setbacks in love or the little success of his painting,
    of his life, we knew nothing and we would have certainly
    ignored his financial difficulties if Theo had spoken to Father
    when they took care of Vincent, because the former paid his
    rent regularly.</p>

    <p>I have finished my account. I would like it to be published
    fully and without anyone modifying the text. I have lately been
    interviewed by journalists who have recorded my words less than
    accurately, or have mixed my declarations with their personal
    ideas, sometimes disagreeable, even going as far as to distort
    what I had told them, or have used my memoirs for purposes
    that, if I had known, would have made me decline the
    interview.</p>

    <p>I am without doubt the last surviving person who personally
    knew Vincent Van Gogh in Auvers, and certainly the last living
    witness of his final days.</p>

    <p>It appears to me therefore that my testimony, of which all
    literary preoccupation is excluded, has an essential value for
    the history of the life of Vincent Van Gogh in Auvers, and
    should not to be confused with fantasies that, over the years,
    have been spread, I don't know by whom, nor to what goal. I add
    that my testimony can not be exploited in such a manner when
    writing the history of the life of Vincent, in Auvers, it is
    given under the condition that the content is fully respected.
    It is possible that this true eyewitness memoir is contrary to
    certain now accepted <i>legends</i>.</p>

    <p>But these - (and later authors who refer to them) - who have
    written the history of the life of Vincent Van Gogh must admit
    that it is only in 1953, on the occasion of the centenary of
    the birth of the great artist, of whom the press is
    preoccupied, have they discovered the woman who was called The
    Lady in Blue. Thus, for sixty-three years, no retelling, by a
    witness of his life, of her memories of the life of Vincent at
    Auvers-sur-Oise had been researched. They have therefore built,
    on disputable foundations, a legend of the life of Van Gogh in
    Auvers-sur-Oise.</p>

    <p>In conscience, I have told what I have seen, then told what
    I have heard from my father who, alone near Vincent, spent the
    tragic night of 27 July 1890. I would like to remain persuaded
    that my account is a document that is useful to preserve, and
    which will serve as a reference when someone wants to write the
    truthful history of the stay of Vincent Van Gogh in
    Auvers-sur-Oise.</p>
