  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received in good order your letter with 50 francs
    enclosed. It was a deliverance, at least a relief, to me. I
    also have some news from Rappard, but nothing definite.</p>

    <p>A letter in answer to mine, that he will help me and come to
    see me, but he writes, &ldquo;I don't feel well again,&rdquo;
    finishes with, &ldquo;I enclose the money.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;P.S. I think I will come at once and bring the money.
    I shall come tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Next day a wire: &ldquo;Cannot come. Letter
    follows.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So, though I have heard, I am not more advanced than in the
    Game of the Goose, where, as you remember, when one alights on
    a goose, one goes on, but if one chances to drop on another
    goose which turn its bill the wrong way, one has to go back to
    one's former position.</p>

    <p>But it is not his fault, for he really has been very ill,
    and is still suffering from the aftereffects. Besides, his
    sister has had the same illness as he, and they have been very
    anxious about her; but she also has recovered. But I believe
    that our friend Rappard is doing things which cost him much
    energy and nervous power and are not worth the time he spends
    on them; so I heard that before his illness he made decorations
    for the centenary of a Utrecht painters' corporation, and now
    he is speaking of church ornaments. I happened to write him my
    disapproval of both things, and both times he happened to fall
    ill after this work. If he was laid up from overwork on his own
    things, it would be all right, but this, I repeat, it is not
    worth powder and shot, and I wrote him again, &ldquo;You are a
    sharp-shooter and one of the few in the present time who carry
    cartridges in their bag. Do not use them except in cases where
    a shot is unavoidable.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I am afraid, dear brother, that the money you advanced our
    dear cousin H. has for the moment assumed the shape of a
    malignant hound, or some such purchase of which he is very
    fond. I believe it is sometimes impossible for him to change
    them back into bank notes or silver coins afterward, because
    he, like many another horse or dog trainer, is caught in some
    jobber's net. I am among those who wish him the greatest
    possible success in his negotiations, and can wish no better
    result than that he may soon pay back what he owes you. At one
    time there were great plans for peopling the plantation with
    innumerable dogs. This kind of breeding may be very laudable,
    but for the moment, I will not say more about it than that I
    hope it may be extraordinarily profitable.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">Has your patient left the hospital for good? But perhaps
    some days of anxiety will follow, no less serious than when she
    was still there.</label></p>

    <p>Michelet rightly says: &ldquo;Une femme est une
    malade.&rdquo; They vary, Theo, they vary like the weather. Now
    he who has eyes to see it finds something beautiful and good in
    <i>every</i> kind of weather, he finds the snow and the burning
    sun beautiful, the storm and the calm, the cold and the heat;
    he loves every season and cannot spare one day of the year, and
    in his heart he is contented and resigned to things being as
    they are. But even if one feels this way about the weather and
    the changing seasons, and the same way about the changing
    feminine nature - believing at heart that there is a reason in
    its enigma too, submitting to what one cannot understand - I
    repeat, even if one could feel this way about it, still our own
    character and opinion are not always, and at every moment, in
    harmony and sympathy with those of the woman to whom we are
    united; and one personally feels anxiety or dissatisfaction or
    doubt, notwithstanding the courage, faith and serenity one may
    have.</p>

    <p>As the professor who attended her confinement told me, it
    will take years before the woman has completely recovered her
    health. That is to say the nervous system remains very
    sensitive, and she possesses the changeability of women to a
    high degree.</p>

    <p>The great danger is - as you will understand - her falling
    back into former errors. This danger, though of a moral nature,
    is connected with the physical constitution. And what I should
    like to call oscillations between improvement and falling back
    into former bad habits worry me continually and seriously. At
    times her temper is such that it is almost unbearable even for
    me - violent, mischievous, bad. I can tell you, I am sometimes
    in despair. She comes round again, and she has often told me
    afterward: <i>I myself do not know what I am doing
    then</i>. Do you remember you wrote me last year that
    you were afraid the mother would become a burden on me?
    Sometimes I wish it had been so. The mother is so energetic
    when she wants to be, and might have done so much better than
    she did. Now she often is more of a trouble than a help. Well,
    when the woman does wrong, it is sometimes the mother's fault;
    and when the mother does wrong, sometimes the family is in back
    of it. These are things which are not so very bad in
    themselves, but they prevent improvement and destroy or
    neutralize all better influences.</p>

    <p>The woman has certain faults and shortcomings in her
    behavior - how could it be otherwise? <i>-</i> <i>but for all
    that she is not bad</i> in my opinion. But those errors must be
    corrected - habits of slovenliness, indifference, lack of
    activity and ability, oh, a lot of things. But they all have
    the same root: bad education, years of quite wrong views on
    life, fatal influence of bad company. I tell you this in
    confidence, you know, and not out of desperation - so that you
    may understand that mine is not a life of moonlight and roses,
    but something prosaic like a Monday morning.</p>

    <p>A small picture by Tissot represents a little figure of a
    woman in the snow among faded flower stems, &ldquo;Voie des
    Fleurs, Voie des Pleurs.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, my woman no longer walks on a path of flowers, as she
    did when she was younger and went her own way and followed her
    instincts. But life has become more thorny for her, has become
    a path of tears, especially last year but this year has thorns
    too, and so will the years to come - but with perseverance she
    will get over it.</p>

    <p>But sometimes there is a crisis - especially when I venture
    to reprove her for some fault which I have had my eye on for a
    long time. So for instance, to give you an example, mending the
    clothes and making clothes for the children herself. But the
    result is that one day she takes it up, and in this respect, as
    in many others, she has already improved greatly. I still have
    to change so many things in myself, too; she must find in me an
    example of diligence and patience, and it is damned difficult,
    brother, to act so that one can indirectly be an example to
    somebody else, and I too fail sometimes. I must raise myself to
    a higher level in order to rouse new impulses in her.</p>

    <p>The little boy, however, does very well; the girl used to be
    very ill and neglected.</p>

    <p>But the little one is a miracle of vitality, already he
    seems to oppose himself to all social institutions and
    conventions. As far as I know, all babies are brought up on a
    kind of bread porridge. But he has refused this most
    energetically; though he has no teeth yet, he bites resolutely
    at a piece of bread, and swallows all kinds of eatables with
    much laughing and cooing and all kinds of noises; but he
    absolutely keeps his mouth shut for porridge. He often sits
    with me in the studio on the floor in a corner, on a few sacks;
    he crows at the drawings and is always quiet in the studio,
    because he looks at the things on the wall. Oh, he is such a
    sociable little fellow!</p>

    <p>The number of studies steadily increases; when you come, I
    think you will perhaps find enough among them to fill a
    portfolio for your room; but this is your own business, as long
    as you understand that you must of course consider those you
    like your own property. But the studies must produce new
    things; and the old studies must produce better ones. I am not
    sure of them myself, but I long for you to see them.</p>

    <p>I saw with great interest an edition of Le Salon 1883: a
    first series of illustrations, some of them remarkably well
    done. Reproduced in that new way. I subscribed to it -
    notwithstanding all my other expenses - with a view to what I
    am doing myself just now with printer's ink and lithographic
    crayon. Listen, I firmly believe that some of my things would
    do well if reproduced in this way, especially -those in which
    the deeper blacks are expressed by lithographic crayon and
    printer's ink; the brownish wash, which I often notice in those
    illustrations, I can get as well. Well, when you come, we can
    talk it over.</p>

    <p>And perhaps I shall write down in detail the different
    things which I want information about, and then you might take
    some of my studies, together with that letter, to show for
    instance to Buhot, who probably could explain many things to
    me.</p>

    <p>I have just read Un M&acirc;le, by Camille Lemonnier - very
    well done, in the manner of Zola. Everything observed from
    nature, and everything analyzed.</p>

    <p>In the show window at Goupil's I saw a large Fromentin,
    &ldquo;A Battle of Fellahs.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I also saw the nouveaut&eacute;s, perhaps not all of them.
    By Julien Dupr&eacute;, about whom I wrote you, I saw two
    things, which I liked less, and found more conventional than
    what I saw by him in a magazine last winter.</p>

    <p>Have you heard that Rappard's picture has now been accepted
    in Amsterdam? It is already late. Thanks for your timely
    help.</p>

    <p>I hope Rappard's &ldquo;letter follows&rdquo; will not last
    too long, and that H. may have some success with his hound
    breeding. Adieu. Best wishes for everything.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>After all, Fromentin is clever and is a
    <i>seeker</i>, and somebody who has perseverance, and he
    is conscientious too.</p>
