  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I was lying awake half the night, Theo, after I wrote you
    last night.</p>

    <p>I am sick at heart about the fact that, coming back after
    two years' absence, the welcome home was kind and cordial in
    every respect, but basically there has been no change whatever,
    not the slightest, in what I must call the most extreme
    blindness and ignorance as to the insight into our mutual
    position. And I again feel almost unbearably disturbed and
    perplexed.</p>

    <p>The fact is that things were going extremely well until the
    moment when Father - not just in the heat of passion, but also
    because he was &ldquo;tired of it&rdquo; - banished me from the
    house. It ought to have been understood then that this was
    supremely important to my success or failure - that things were
    made ten times more difficult for me by this - almost
    impossible.</p>

    <p>If I had not had the same feeling at the time which I now
    have again, namely that notwithstanding all good intentions,
    notwithstanding all the kindness of the reception,
    notwithstanding anything you like, there is a certain hardness
    in Father, like iron, an icy coldness - something that gives
    the impression of dry sand or glass or tinplate - for all his
    outward gentleness - if, as I said, I had not had this feeling
    already, I should not have resented it so much.</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin] I am not so much interested in a
    kind or an unkind reception - it grieves me that they do not
    regret what they did at the time. Now I am again in an almost
    unbearable state of wavering and inner struggle.</p>

    <p>You understand that I should not write as I do - having
    undertaken the journey hither of my own free will having been
    the first to swallow my pride - if I did not find real
    obstacles in my way.</p>

    <p>If I had now noticed some eagerness to do as the Rappards
    did, with the best results, and as we began here with good
    results too - if I had noticed that Father had also realized
    that he ought <i>not</i> to have shut his house to me, then I
    should have felt some confidence in the future.</p>

    <p>Nothing, nothing of all that.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.father">In Father's mind there was not then, there is not now, the
    faintest shadow of a doubt that what he did was the right
    thing.</p>

    <p>Father does not know remorse like you and me and any man who
    is human.</p>

    <p>Father believes in his own righteousness, whereas you and I
    and other human creatures are imbued with the feeling that we
    <i>consist</i> of errors and efforts of the lost souls. I
    commiserate with people like Father - <i>in my heart of hearts
    I cannot be angry with him</i> - because I think they are more
    unhappy than I. </label>Why do I think them unhappy? - because the good
    within them is wrongly applied, so that it acts like evil
    because the <i>light</i> within them is black and spreads
    darkness, obscurity around them.</p>

    <p>Their cordial reception grieves me - their <i>indulgence</i>
    without acknowledging their error is for me, perhaps worse than
    the error itself. Instead of a ready understanding and a
    certain eager contribution to my, and indirectly their own,
    well-being I feel in everything a hesitation and delay which
    paralyze my own ardor and energy like a leaden atmosphere.</p>

    <p>My masculine intellect tells me that I must consider it an
    irrevocable, fatal fact that in the depth of our souls Father
    and I are irreconcilable My compassion for Father as well as
    for myself says to me, &ldquo;Irreconcilable?&rdquo; -
    &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; - indefinitely, for ever and ever, there
    is the possibility of and one should have faith in the
    possibility of, a decisive reconciliation. But this - ah, why
    is it probable, alas, that it will turn out &ldquo;an
    illusion&rdquo;?</p>

    <p>Do you call this moroseness on my part?</p>

    <p>Our life is an appalling reality, and we ourselves are
    infinitely driven, things are - as they are - and whether we
    take them more or less gloomily does not in any way alter the
    nature of things. I think about it this way, for instance at
    night when I lie awake, or I think about it this way in the
    storm on the heath in the evening, in the dreary twilight.</p>

    <p><?showImage("403_V-T_3450");?>
     In the daytime, in daily life, I sometimes look as
    thick-skinned as a wild boar perhaps and I can well understand
    that people find <i>me</i> crude<i>.</i></p>

    <p>[Here Vincent crossed out the text &ldquo;People are much
    like brushes: those with the finest looks are not the finest in
    practice.]</p>

    <p>When I was younger I myself also thought, much more than
    now, that things depended on coincidence, or small things or
    misunderstandings that were without any foundation. But getting
    older, I feel it more and more differently, and see deeper
    motives. Life is &ldquo;a queer thing&rdquo; too, brother.</p>

    <p>You see how agitated my letters are, one moment I think that
    it <i>can be done</i>, the next, that it <i>cannot</i>.
    One thing is clear to me, &ldquo;that things don't go readily,
    that there is no eagerness.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I have decided to go and see Rappard, and tell him that I
    myself should be agreeable to staying at home, but that
    notwithstanding all the advantages this would have, there is a
    je ne sais quoi in Father which I am beginning to look upon as
    incurable and which makes me listless and powerless. Last night
    it was decided that I shall stay here for a time - and
    notwithstanding this, next morning I again hear, Let's think it
    over some more - oh yes, sleep on it a night or so, and think
    it over!!! - <i>when they have been able to think it over for
    two years - ought</i> to have thought it over of their own
    accord, as a matter of course.</p>

    <p><?showImage("403_V-T_3451");?>
     Two years, every day of which was a day of distress to me; for
    them - everyday life, as if nothing had happened, as if nothing
    could happen - the burden did not weigh on them. You say they
    do not express it, but they feel it - <i>I do not believe
    it</i>. I have thought so myself, but it is <i>all
    wrong</i>. One <i>acts</i> as one <i>feels</i> - our
    acts, our ready compliance or our hesitation, they are what
    people may know us by - not by what we say with our lips,
    kindly or unkindly. Good intentions, opinions, in reality all
    this is <i>less than nothing</i>.</p>

    <p>You may think of me what you will, Theo, but I tell you that
    it is not my imagination. I tell you <i>Father will not
    cooperate</i>.</p>

    <p>I see now what I saw <i>then</i> -I flatly <i>contradicted
    Father</i> then, I shall now speak out <i>in any case</i>
    whatever might happen <i>against</i> Father once more because
    he does not <i>want</i> it, he makes it <i>impossible.</i></p>

    <p>It is damned awful, brother, the Rappards acted
    intelligently, but here!!!!! And everything one has done and is
    doing about it, it is rendered &frac34; useless because of
    <i>them</i>. It's tiresome, brother. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin] They think <i>they did no harm at
    the time</i>, this is <i>too</i> bad.</p>
