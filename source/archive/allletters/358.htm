  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter - Mother is doing well - at first the
    doctor said it would take half a year for the leg to heal - now
    he speaks of a good 3 months -<label content="attitude.sisters"> and he told Mother, &ldquo;But
    we have your daughter to thank for that, for I have rarely,
    very rarely, come across care as good as she gives.&rdquo; What
    Wil does is exemplary, exemplary, I shan't easily forget
    it.</p>

    <p>Almost everything fell on her shoulders from the beginning
    and she has spared Mother a great deal of misery. To give just
    one example, it is undoubtedly thanks to her that Mother has so
    few bedsores (which had been absolutely dreadful in the
    beginning and in quite an advanced condition). And I assure you
    that the chores she has to do are not always pleasant.</label></p>

    <p>Now look, when I read your letter about the drawings I
    immediately sent you a new watercolour of a weaver and five pen
    drawings. <label content="business.selling">I must also tell you frankly that for my part I'm
    sure you're right to say that my work must improve a great
    deal, but at the same time I also think that your efforts to do
    something with it could become a bit more determined. You have
    <i>never yet</i> sold a <i>single thing</i> I have done -
    whether for a lot or a little - <i>in fact, you haven't even
    tried</i>.</label></p>

    <p>Look, I'm not <i>angry</i> about it, but we need to speak
    our minds now for once. I could certainly not put up with it in
    the long run. You, for your part, can also continue to speak
    frankly.</p>

    <p>As far as saleability or unsaleability is concerned, that's
    a dead horse I don't intend to go on flogging. Anyway, as you
    can see, my answer is to send you some new ones - and I shall
    be very happy to go on doing so - I should like nothing better.
    Only be unsparing for once with your candour - which is what I
    much prefer - about whether you intend to bother with them or
    whether your dignity will not allow you. Leaving the past
    aside, I have to face the future, and regardless of what you
    think about them I shall definitely try to do something with
    them.</p>

    <p>The other day you told me yourself that you are a
    <i>dealer</i> - all right - one does not indulge in
    sentimentality with a dealer, one says, &ldquo;Sir, if I give
    you some drawings on commission, may I then count on your
    showing them?&rdquo; The dealer must know for himself whether
    his answer will be yes, no, or something in between. But the
    painter would be mad to send them on commission if he could
    tell that the dealer looked on his work as something that ought
    not to see the light of day.</p>

    <p>Well, my dear fellow, we both live in the real world, and
    precisely because we do not want to put a spoke in each other's
    wheel we must speak candidly. If you say, &ldquo;I can't be
    bothered with them&rdquo; - all right, I won't be angry, but
    I'm not obliged to take you for an infallible oracle either, am
    I? You say the public will take offense at this little smudge
    or that, etc., etc. Now listen, that may well be true, but you,
    the <i>dealer</i>, are <i>even more</i> upset by that sort of
    thing than the public in question, as I have observed so often,
    and you <i>set out</i> with that idea.</p>

    <p>I, too, must make my way somehow or other, Theo, and with
    you I am still in precisely - precisely - the same position I
    was a few years ago. What you say about my current work -
    &ldquo;it is <i>almost</i> saleable, <i>but</i> - &rdquo; is
    <i>literally the same thing you wrote to me when I sent you my
    first Brabant sketches from Etten</i>.</p>

    <p>That's why I tell you - it's a dead horse. And I have to
    conclude that you'll go on saying the same thing for ever - and
    that I, who have been consistently chary of going to the
    dealers up to now, am going to have to change my tactics and
    try my very best to get my work sold.</p>

    <p>It's become very clear to me by this time that you couldn't
    care less about my doings, but while you couldn't care less, I
    cannot help thinking it is rather wretched of you, and I dread
    certain things that are bound to occur - namely that people
    will say, how strange, don't you do any business with your
    brother or with Goupil? Well, what I'll say then, is - it is
    beneath the dignity of Ces Messieurs G. &amp; Co., Van Gogh
    &amp; Co. That may well give them a bad impression of me - for
    which I am quite prepared by now - but I also foresee that I
    shall grow cooler and cooler towards you.</p>

    <p>I have now painted <art id=0034>the little old church</art>, and another
    weaver. Are those studies from Drenthe as bad as all that? I
    don't feel disposed to send you the painted studies I have done
    here, no, we won't start with them - you can see them if you
    come here in the spring.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">What you write about Marie is quite understandable - if a
    woman isn't all milk-and-water, I can well imagine her not
    showing much enthusiasm for moping about in the company of
    cantankerous fathers as well as spiritual sisters.</label> In any
    event, a woman no less than a man would feel sorely tempted to
    end the stagnation quand m&ecirc;me [at all costs] - stagnation
    which may start out as splendid resignation, but which, alas,
    one will generally be made to regret as soon as one feels one
    is going freeze solid in the end. Once I read a passage by
    Daudet about spiritual women. &ldquo;Ces deux visages se
    regard&egrave;rent - elles &eacute;chang&egrave;rent un regard
    m&eacute;chant froid ferm&eacute; - qu'a-t-il? Toujours la
    m&ecirc;me chose - elle.&rdquo; [Those two faces looked at each
    other - they exchanged a spiteful, cold, secretive glance -
    what's the matter with her? Always the same thing - she is.]
    There you have it, that singular look of Pharisees and devout
    ladies. Yes, and as for us, too, is - la m&ecirc;me chose.</p>

    <p>So, what am I to make of what you say about my work - say,
    the studies from Drenthe. Some of them are very superficial,
    and I said as much myself. But why do I get chided for those
    painted out of doors, quietly, calmly and simply, in which I
    was trying <i>to express nothing but what I saw</i>?
    What I get is: aren't you too obsessed with Michel?</p>

    <p>(I am referring here to the study of <art id=1097>the cottage in the
    twilight</art>, and to the largest of the sod huts,
    namely <art id=0022>the one with the small green field in the foreground.)</art></p>

    <p>You would no doubt say exactly the same thing about the old
    churchyard. And yet, faced neither by the churchyard nor by the
    sod huts did I think or Michel, I was thinking of the subject I
    had before me. A subject that I believe would indeed have
    stopped Michel short, and touched him, had he passed by.</p>

    <p>As far as I am concerned, in no way do I put myself on a par
    with Master Michel - and I most certainly do not imitate Michel
    either.</p>

    <p>Well, perhaps I shall try to sell something in Antwerp, and
    I'm going to put a few of those very same Drenthe studies in a
    black wooden frame - I'm approaching a carpenter here about it
    - I prefer to see my work in a deep black frame, and he makes
    them cheaply enough.</p>

    <p>Don't take offense at my mentioning it, brother. I am trying
    to put something quiet and calm into my work. You see, I
    approve <i>just as little</i> of it lying about unseen as I
    would of seeing it displayed in fluted frames in the leading
    galleries.</p>

    <p>Now is the time to start taking that middle course, in my
    view, so I must know fairly definitely how I stand with you, or
    rather, I must tell you again that, although you are still
    evading the question, I'm sure that you are not, in fact, going
    to show the work, and I don't think you'll be changing your
    mind for the time being either. I won't enter into whether or
    not you are right about this.</p>

    <p>You will tell me that other dealers will treat me in just
    the same way, except that you, although you cannot be bothered
    yourself with my work, nevertheless provide me with money, and
    other dealers will certainly not do that, and that without
    money I shall be completely stuck. I shall reply that things
    are not as cut and dried as that in real life, and that I shall
    try to get by, living from day to day.</p>

    <p>I told you beforehand that I wanted to settle matters this
    month, and so I must. Anyway, seeing that you may already be
    planning to come here in the spring, I am not going to insist
    that you make a final decision <i>immediately</i>, but I must
    tell you that as far as I am concerned, I cannot leave matters
    as they are. Everywhere I go, and especially at home, a
    constant watch is being kept on what I do with my work, whether
    I get anything for it, etc. In our society virtually everybody
    looks out all the time for that sort of thing, trying to find
    out everything about it. And that is quite understandable. But
    being permanently in a false position is a wretched business
    for me. Allons - things cannot be allowed to remain as they
    are. Why not? Because they can't, that's why.</p>

    <p>Seeing that I am as cool as can be towards Father, towards
    C. M. - why should I act any differently towards you, once I've
    noticed that you use the same tactics of never speaking your
    mind? Do I consider myself better than Father or you? Most
    probably not, most probably I distinguish less and less between
    good and bad - but I do know that this tactic does not behove a
    painter, and as a painter one should speak one's mind and cut
    some Gordian knots. Well, I believe qu'une porte doit
    &ecirc;tre ouverte ou ferm&eacute;e [that a door must be either
    open or closed].</p>

    <p>Anyway, I'm sure you do understand that a dealer
    <i>cannot</i> be neutral toward painters - that it makes
    <i>absolutely</i> no difference whether you say no with or
    without beating about the bush, and that it's probably even
    more annoying when you dress it all up in compliments.</p>

    <p>This may be something you'll understand better later on than
    you do at the moment. I pity dealers when they grow old -
    though they may feather their own nest, that isn't any
    cure-all, at least it won't be by then. Tout se paye
    [everything has its price], and things can often turn out to be
    an icy-cold wasteland <i>then</i>.</p>

    <p>But you may perhaps have different ideas about this. You may
    point out that it's a bit sad as well when a painter dies
    miserably in a hospital and is buried alongside the whores in
    the fosse commune [common grave], where many lie, after all -
    especially when one bears in mind that dying is perhaps not as
    difficult as living.</p>

    <p>Anyway, a dealer cannot be blamed for not always having the
    money to help out, but in my opinion a certain worthy dealer
    can indeed be blamed if he's all kind words but is ashamed of
    me in his heart and ignores my work altogether.</p>

    <p>So, frankly, I shall not blame you for telling me candidly
    that you don't think my work is good enough, or perhaps that
    there are other reasons why you cannot be bothered with it, but
    if you put it away in a dark corner somewhere and do not show
    it, it isn't kind to couple that with the assurance - <i>which
    is not accepted</i> - that you yourself see something in
    it.</p>

    <p>I don't believe it - you mean hardly one word of it. And
    from the very fact that you yourself say that you know my work
    better than anyone else, I am entitled to conclude that you
    must have a very poor opinion of it indeed if you won't soil
    your hands with it. Why should I force myself upon you? Well,
    regards,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Apart from a few years which I can scarcely comprehend
    myself, when I was confused by religious ideas, by some kind of
    mysticism - that period aside, I have always lived with a
    certain warmth. Now everything is getting grimmer and colder
    and more dreary around me. And when I tell you that in the
    first place I <i>will</i> not stand it, quite apart from the
    question of whether or not I <i>can</i>, I am referring to what
    I told you at the very beginning of our relationship</p>

    <p>What I have had against you this past year is a kind of
    relapse into cold respectability which seems to me sterile and
    futile - the diametrical opposite of everything that is active,
    and of everything that is artistic in particular.</p>

    <p>I am putting this to you bluntly, not in order to make you
    miserable, but so that you can see, and if possible feel, what
    has gone wrong, why I can no longer think of you as a brother
    and a friend with the same pleasure as before.</p>

    <p>There needs to be more gusto in my life if I am to get more
    brio into my brush - exercising patience will not get me a
    hair's breadth further. If you, for your part, do relapse into
    the above-mentioned state, don't blame me for not being the
    same towards you as I was during, say, the first year.</p>

    <p>As to my drawings - at this moment it seems to me that the
    watercolours, the pen-and-ink drawings of weavers, the latest
    pen-and-ink drawings on which I am working now, are not on the
    whole so boring as to be utterly worthless. But <i>if</i> I
    should come to the conclusion myself that they are no good and
    Theo is right not to show them to anybody - then, then, it will
    be <i>one proof more</i> to me that I am right to object to our
    present false position, and I shall try all the harder to make
    a change quand m&ecirc;me, for better or for worse, just as
    long as things don't remain the same&hellip;</p>

    <p>Now supposing I realized that you, in the belief that I had
    not yet made enough progress, were trying to do something to
    further that progress - for instance, Mauve having fallen by
    the wayside, to put me in touch with some other able painter -
    or, anyway, <i>something</i>, some sign or bother that would
    prove to me that you really believed in my progress or had it
    to heart. But instead there is - the money, yes - but for the
    rest nothing but &ldquo;just carry on working,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;have patience,&rdquo; as cold, as dead, as arid and as
    insufferable as if Father, for instance, had said it. I cannot
    live on that, it is getting too lonely, too cold, too empty and
    too dull for me.</p>

    <p>I am no better than the next man, inasmuch as I have my
    needs and desires as everybody else, and it is perfectly
    natural to kick when one <i>knows for certain</i> that one is
    being kept dangling, being kept in the dark. If one goes from
    bad to worse - which is not impossible in my case - what
    difference does that make? If one is badly off, one simply must
    take the chance to better one's lot.</p>

    <p>Brother, let me remind you once more how things stood with
    us when we first worked together. I even felt free to draw your
    attention to the problem of women. I still remember taking you
    to Roosendaal station that first year and telling you then that
    I was so set against being alone that I would sooner be with a
    bad whore than be alone. You may perhaps remember that.</p>

    <p>At first the idea that our relationship might not last was
    all but intolerable to me. And I would have been tremendously
    pleased if it had been a simple matter to change things. But I
    <i>cannot</i> keep flying in the face of the evidence and
    fooling myself that it <i>is</i>. The resulting depression was
    one of the causes for my writing from Drenthe and urging you so
    strongly to become a painter. And it subsided the moment I saw
    that your dissatisfaction with business had disappeared, that
    you were once again on a better footing with Goupil. At first I
    though less than sincere of you - then later, and even now, I
    find it entirely understandable and consider it more a mistake
    on my part to have written, &ldquo;become a painter,&rdquo;
    than a mistake on your part to have resumed your business with
    gusto once things had become more acceptable and the
    machinations to make things impossible for you had ended.</p>

    <p>It remains a fact, however, that I do feel depressed about
    the falseness of the position between us. At the moment it is
    of greater importance to me to sell for 5 guilders than to
    receive 10 guilders by way of patronage.</p>

    <p>Now you have repeatedly written, very firmly, that neither
    in the first place as a dealer (I shall leave it at that for
    the moment and do not at any rate hold it against you), nor in
    the second place in your private capacity (which I do hold
    against you a little), have you taken, are you taking, or do
    you think you will be able to take for some time to come, the
    very slightest, smallest possible, step to further my work.</p>

    <p>I mustn't be supine or spineless about this, so, to be
    blunt: if you do nothing with my work, I do not want your
    patronage. I state the reason plainly, the more so as I can
    hardly avoid giving you some explanation for it. So it is not
    that I am overlooking the help you have given me since the
    beginning or wish to belittle it. The fact is that I see more
    good in the most miserable, most wretched drudgery than in
    patronage, into which matters are degenerating. In the very,
    very beginning one cannot do without it, but for heaven's sake,
    it is time for me to try and muddle along, God knows how,
    rather than acquiesce in something that, after all, will get us
    <i>no further</i>.</p>

    <p>Whether brotherly or otherwise, if you can do absolutely
    nothing except give financial assistance, you might as well
    keep that to yourself too. As matters are now, and have been
    during the past <i>year</i>, they have, if I may say so, been
    exclusively confined to money. And although you say you leave
    me completely free, it seems to me that ultimately, for
    example, if I keep company with a woman of whom you and others
    do not approve, perhaps rightly, though sometimes I don't give
    a damn about that, there is a small tug at the purse strings to
    make me feel that it is &ldquo;in my own interests&rdquo; to
    defer to your opinion.</p>

    <p>When it came to that business with the woman, you also had
    your way, and it came to an end, but&hellip;I'm damned if I'll
    practice morality in order to get a little bit of money. Yet in
    itself I do not think it was absurd of you to disapprove when I
    wanted to go through with it last summer. But I can foresee the
    following in the future: I shall again have a relationship
    with someone from what you people call the lower orders - and,
    should I still have a relationship with you, meet with the same
    opposition. Opposition from all of you that might have some
    semblance of justification if I were given enough money to live
    differently. Which is what you do not, cannot or will not give,
    apr&egrave;s tout - neither you nor Father nor C. M. nor any of
    the others who are in the forefront when it comes to
    disapproving of this or that, and which I don't want from you,
    apr&egrave;s tout, seeing that I do not give a great deal of
    thought to the question of lower or upper orders.</p>

    <p>Do you see why I wasn't being foolhardy, and wouldn't be if
    I tried the same thing again? Firstly, because I have no
    pretensions, <i>do not feel the slightest</i> urge to maintain
    any sort of position in society or whatever you call it, and
    secondly because, as I do not receive the necessary means from
    anyone, nor do I earn them, I consider myself absolutely free
    to consort with the so-called lower orders if the opportunity
    should arise.</p>

    <p>We should be perpetually coming back to the same problem.
    Now, just ask yourself if I am alone among those in my trade
    who most decidedly refuse the kind of patronage that entails
    being obliged to keep up some sort of position while the money
    is below the requisite level, so that they incur debts instead
    of making progress. Could it be done on the money, I might
    perhaps knuckle under like so many others. But we have
    certainly not reached that point yet - as you said yourself, I
    still have a good many years to get through during which my
    work will have precious little commercial value. All right -
    then I would rather end up having to eke out a living and
    manger de la vache enrag&eacute;e [go through hard times] than
    fall into the hands of Messrs. Van Gogh.</p>

    <p>My only regret about quarrelling with Father at the time is
    that I didn't do it 10 years earlier. If you continue to follow
    in the footsteps of Father, etc., you will find yourself
    gradually getting bored - and becoming a bore to certain
    people. But those are &ldquo;mauvais coucheurs&rdquo; [awkward
    customers] you will say, people who carry no weight.</p>

    <p>Just think it over, my dear fellow - I do not hide my
    innermost thoughts from you - I weigh the pros and cons on both
    sides. A <i>wife</i> you cannot give me, a <i>child</i> you
    cannot give me, <i>work</i> you cannot give me.</p>

    <p>Money, yes - but what good is it to me? If I have to forgo
    the rest, your money remains sterile, because it is not used in
    the way I have always told you it should be - a working man's
    household if needs be, but if one doesn't make sure of having a
    home of one's own, then art cannot flourish.</p>

    <p>And as for me - I told you plainly enough, to be sure, in my
    younger days: if I cannot get a good woman, I shall take a bad
    one, better a bad one than none at all. I know enough people
    who profess the exact opposite and who are as frightened of
    &ldquo;children&rdquo; as I am of &ldquo;no
    children.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And as for me - just because something often goes wrong - I
    do not give a principle up lightly. And the reason why I have
    few fears for the future is because I know how and why I have
    acted in the past. And because I know that there are others who
    feel the way I do.</p>

    <p>You say that you are suspicious - but why, of what, and what
    good will it do you or me? Do you grow wiser by being
    suspicious? I hope you realize the contrary is true - but
    again, it is loyal of you to admit that you are suspicious -
    and that is why I reply, something that would otherwise have
    been beneath me. And my reply is very short: I mean neither
    you, nor Father nor anyone else any harm, but I am very
    seriously thinking of deciding to part company with you and of
    seeking a new relationship, precisely with a view to preventing
    further harm. Sooner or later we would clash as Father and I
    have clashed <i>and then I</i><i>could not allow myself to
    yield</i>. Voil&agrave; tout [that's all], on the one hand my
    duty commands me to love my father and my brother - <i>which I
    do</i> - but we are living in an age of renewal and reform and
    many things have become completely outmoded, and consequently I
    see, I feel, I believe differently from Father, differently
    from you. And because I try to distinguish between the good as
    an abstract ideal and my own imperfect self, I do not come out
    with big words, but simply say, the way to stay good friends is
    - to part company. It is a hard thing for me to say, but I am
    reconciled to it.</p>

    <p>You will probably gather that though I may be unclear about
    the future, I am not afraid. And am even in a very tranquil
    frame of mind. And yet, there is a great deal going on inside
    me, in part from a keen sense of obligation, which is sure to
    persist - and on the other hand from a feeling of
    disappointment, seeing that the reasons why my career must be
    broken off as it began, namely with your help and support,
    strike me as being utterly <i>absurd</i>.</p>

    <p>Still, it would be wrong to carry on, since - <i>if</i> we
    did - we should most probably have a violent quarrel in a few
    years' time, and it might end in hatred. Now I still have time
    to look around - and if I should be forced to do battle
    elsewhere, then at least it will not be with my brother. And -
    isn't that looking at things coolly and weighing up the pros
    and cons?</p>

    <p>I shan't be depressed as a result, believe me, but neither
    am I being reckless. I have found peace of mind now that I have
    resolved on a separation, because I am convinced that <i>if</i>
    we went on as before, we should <i>later</i> become of a
    hindrance to each other rather than a help.</p>

    <p>Rappard said, don't go to Antwerp before you are sure of
    finding something there - but how can one tell in advance what
    one may come across? And if I keep my studio here as a refuge,
    then now is the time to make a start. It will always be there,
    so it is certainly not my immediate intention to turn my back
    on these parts completely.</p>

    <p>You probably realize, Theo, that on my long walks I have
    thought things over at length and often. I do not want to get
    embroiled in a second series of quarrels, of the kind I had
    with <i>Father I</i>, with <i>Father II</i> - <i>Father II
    being yourself</i>. <i>One is enough</i>. That phrase is
    planted fair and square at the center of my thoughts - draw
    your own conclusions.</p>

    <p>What's more, let me also tell you that I never behaved
    towards Father, nor do I want to be aggressive towards you, my
    brother. I have often restrained myself - when with strangers I
    would have fought quite differently and more fiercely.</p>

    <p>But this is just what ties my hands in the circumstances.
    There is a new field over there for me and one where I can do
    as I please, as a stranger among strangers - over there, I
    shall have neither rights nor duties. And I shall be able to be
    more offhand - bonne volont&eacute; d'&ecirc;tre inoffensif,
    certitude de r&eacute;sister [willingness not to cause offense,
    confidence to stand firm], that is my goal and I am in search
    of it with all there is in me.</p>

    <p>But taking everything lying down has to be paid for later -
    so - one has to act. Working here and looking for new contacts
    is the way forward. Unfortunately money is needed for both and
    the prospects for making a breakthrough are poor. And - time is
    money, too - and by carrying on as I am now I shall not get any
    richer.</p>

    <p>But now you know my motives - if I should go on, you would
    become Father II in my life, and although I know that you mean
    well - you don't understand me at all, and so no headway can be
    made.</p>
