  <body>
    <p>[In this letter Vincent in his haste omits the &ldquo;Dear
    Theo.&rdquo;]</p>

    <p>I have been thinking over what we were discussing, and the
    saying sprang to mind, `Nous sommes aujourd'hui ce que nous
    &eacute;tions hier.' [We are today what we were yesterday] That
    does not mean that one must stand still and may not try to
    improve oneself, on the contrary, it is a compelling reason for
    doing so and for being glad to do so. But to be true to the
    saying, one must not backslide, and once one has started to
    look at things freely and openly, one must not face about or
    stray.</p>

    <p>Those who said: &ldquo;We are the same today as we were
    yesterday,&rdquo; were &ldquo;honn&ecirc;tes hommes&rdquo;
    [honest men], as is apparent from the constitution they drew
    up, which will remain for all time and of which it has been
    well said that it was written &ldquo;avec le rayon d'en haut et
    d'un doigt de feu.&rdquo; [With a ray of light from on high and
    a fiery finger&rdquo;].</p>

    <p>It is a good thing to be an &ldquo;honn&ecirc;tes homme&rdquo; and to
    try increasingly to be one, partially and wholly, and one does
    well to understand that this entails being an &ldquo;homme
    int&eacute;reur et spirituel.&rdquo; [An inward and spiritual
    man].</p>

    <p>He who is firmly convinced he is one of their band will
    always go about his business quietly and calmly, never doubting
    that all must end well. There once was a man who went to church
    and asked: &ldquo;Can it be that my ardour has deceived me,
    that I have taken a wrong turning and managed things badly? Oh!
    if only I could be rid of this doubt and know for certain I
    shall come out victorious and succeed in the end.&rdquo; And
    then a voice answered him: &ldquo;And if you were certain, what
    would you do then? Act now as if you were certain and you will
    not be disappointed.&rdquo; Then the man went on his way, not
    unbelieving but believing, and returned to his work no longer
    doubting or wavering.</p>

    <p>As for being an `homme int&eacute;reur et spirituel' might
    one not be able to develop into one through knowledge of
    history in general and of certain individuals from all ages in
    particular, from the history of the Bible to that of the
    Revolution and from the Odyssey to the books of Dickens and
    Michelet? And could we not learn something from the work of
    such men as Rembrandt and from Breton's Mauvaises Herbes or
    Millet's The Hours of the Day, Le
    B&eacute;n&eacute;dicit&eacute; by de Groux or Brion, or The
    Conscript by de Groux (or else by Conscience) or his
    Apoth&eacute;caire or The Large Oaks, by Dupr&eacute;, or even
    by Michel's mills and sandy plains?</p>

    <p>It is by continually holding fast to these thoughts and
    deeds that we are filled with a good leaven at the last, that
    of being sorrowful yet always rejoicing, which will become
    apparent when our lives have come to fruition, bearing the
    fruits of good works.</p>

    <p>Le rayon d'en haut does not always shine upon us and may
    well be hidden behind clouds, but without that light a man
    cannot live and is worth nothing and can do no good, and those
    who claim that man can live without faith in that higher light
    and need not trouble to acquire it, are sure to have their
    hopes dashed.</p>

    <p>We have talked a good deal about our duty and how we may
    attain the right goal, and we have properly concluded that our
    first objective must be to find a specific position and a
    profession to which we can wholly devote ourselves. And I
    believe that we also agreed on this point, viz. that one must
    pay particular attention to the end, and that a victory gained
    after a whole life of work and effort is better than one gained
    with greater dispatch.</p>

    <p>Anyone who lives an upright life and experiences real
    difficulty and disappointment and yet is not crushed by them is
    worth more than one for whom everything has always been plain
    sailing and who has known nothing but relative prosperity. For
    who are the most obviously superior to us? Those who merit the
    words: &ldquo;Laboureurs, votre vie est triste, laboureurs,
    vous souffrez dans la vie, laboureurs, vous &ecirc;tes
    bien-heureaux,&rdquo; [Labourers, your life is sad, labourers,
    your life is full of suffering, labourers, you are blessed]. It
    is they who bear the marks of &ldquo;toute une vie de lutte et
    de travail soutenu sans fl&ecirc;chir jamais.&rdquo; [a whole
    life of struggle and labour borne unflinchingly] It is right to
    try to become like that. So we go on our way, &ldquo;undefessi
    favente Deo.&rdquo; [Should be <i>indefessi favente Deo</i>,
    (by the grace of God unwearied)]</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">As for me, I must become a good preacher, who has something
    to say that is right and is of use in the world, and perhaps it
    is as well that I should spend a relatively long time on
    preparation and be securely confirmed in an unwavering faith
    before I am called to speak to others about it.</label> (It is fitting
    that before one embarks upon that work, a treasure should be
    gathered up that others can enjoy). Let us but go forth
    quietly, testing everything and holding fast to what is good,
    and trying all the time to learn more of what is useful and
    adds to our experience. <i>Weemoed</i> [Melancholy] may be a
    good experience, provided we write it as two words: <i>wee</i>
    [woe], which is in every man, each of us having reason enough,
    but it must be allied to <i>moed</i> [courage], and the more
    the better, for it is good to be someone who never
    despairs.</p>

    <p>If only we try to live righteously, we shall fare well, even
    though we are bound to encounter genuine sadness and real
    disappointments and shall probably commit real mistakes and do
    things that are wrong, but it is certainly better to be ardent
    in spirit, even though one makes more mistakes, than to be
    narrow-minded and over-cautious.</p>

    <p>It is good to love as many things as one can, for therein
    lies true strength, and those who loves much, do much and
    accomplish much, and whatever is done with love is done well.
    If one is affected by some book or other, let us say by
    Michelet's L' hirondelle, L'alouette, Le rossignol, Les
    aspirations d'aut-omne, Je vois d'ici une dame, J'aimais cette
    petite ville singuli&egrave;re - to mention just a few, then it
    is because that book is written from the heart in simplicity
    and meekness of spirit. Better to say but a few words, but
    filled with meaning, than to say many that are but idle sounds
    and as easy to utter as they are useless</p>

    <p>Love is the best and the noblest thing in the human heart,
    especially when it is tested by life as gold is tested by fire.
    Happy is he who has loved much, and is sure of himself, and
    although he may have wavered and doubted, he has kept that
    divine spark alive and returned to what was in the beginning
    and ever shall be. If only one keeps loving faithfully what is
    truly worth loving and does not squander one's love on trivial
    and insignificant and meaningless things then one will
    gradually obtain more light and grow stronger.</p>

    <p>The sooner one tries to become accomplished in a certain
    position in life and a certain field and adopts a relatively
    independent way of thinking and acting, and the more one keeps
    to set rules, the stronger in character one will grow, and that
    does not mean becoming narrow-minded. It is a wise thing to do
    this, because life is short, and time passes quickly. If one is
    accomplished in one single thing, understanding one single
    thing well, then one has insight into and knowledge of many
    other things into the bargain.</p>

    <p>It's as well to go out into the world from time to time and
    mix with other people (and sometimes one feels, in fact,
    obliged and called upon to do so) - or it may simply be
    <i>one</i> way `de se jeter dans le travail sans arri&egrave;re
    pens&eacute;e et de toutes ses forces' [Of throwing oneself
    into work unreservedly and with all one's strength] - but one
    who prefers to be quietly alone with his work and seems to need
    very few friends will go safest in the world and among people.
    One should never feel secure just because one has no
    difficulties or cares or handicaps, and one should never be too
    easy-going. Even in the politest circles and the best
    surroundings and circumstances one should retain something of
    the original character of a Robinson Crusoe or of primitive
    man, for otherwise one cannot be rooted in oneself, and one
    must never let the fire in one's soul die, for the time will
    inevitably come when it will be needed. And he who chooses
    poverty for himself and loves it possesses a great treasure and
    will hear the voice of his conscience address him ever more
    clearly. He who hears that voice, which is God's greatest gift,
    in his innermost being and follows it, finds in it a friend at
    last, and is never alone!</p>

    <p>Happy is he who has faith in God, for he will in the end be
    tided over all life's difficulties, albeit not without trouble
    and sorrow. One cannot do better than hold on to the thought of
    God come what may, in all circumstances, in every place and at
    all times, and try to get to know Him better. One can learn
    this from the Bible as well as from all other things. It is
    good to go on believing that everything is more miraculous than
    one can ever begin to understand, for that is the truth; it is
    good to remain sensitive and humble and tender-hearted even
    though one may have to hide one's feelings, as is often
    necessary. It is good to be well versed in the things that are
    hidden from the wise and the learned of this world, but that
    are revealed as if by nature to the poor and simple, to women
    and little children. For what can one learn which is better
    than that which God has given by nature to every human soul and
    which goes on living and loving, hoping and believing, in the
    depths of every soul, unless we wantonly destroy it.</p>

    <p>The need is for nothing less than the infinite and the
    miraculous, and a man does well to be satisfied with nothing
    less, and not to feel easy until he has gained it.</p>

    <p>That is what all great men have acknowledged in their works,
    all those who have thought a little more deeply and searched
    and worked and loved a little more than the rest, who have
    plumbed the depths of the sea of life. Plumb the depths, that
    is what we too must do if we want to make a catch, and if we
    sometimes have to work the whole night through without catching
    anything, then we do well not to give up and to cast the net
    once more at dawn.</p>

    <p>So let us go forward quietly, each on his own path, forever
    making for the light, `sursum corda' [lift up your hearts], and
    in the knowledge that we are as others are and that others are
    as we are and that it is right to love one another in the best
    possible way, believing all things, hoping for all things and
    enduring all things, and never failing. And not being too
    troubled by our weaknesses, for even he who has none, has one
    weakness, namely that he has none, and anyone who believes
    himself to be consummately wise would do well to be foolish all
    over again.</p>

    <p>`<i>Nous sommes aujourd'hui ce que nous &eacute;tions
    hier'</i>, that is, `<i>honn&ecirc;tes hommes'</i>, yet men who
    must be tested in the fire of life to become fortified inwardly
    are confirmed in what, by the grace of God, they are by
    nature.</p>

    <p>So may it be with us, my boy, and may you fare well along
    your path, and may God be with you in all things and help you
    to succeed, which, with a warm handshake on your departure
    [Theo had been temporarily transferred to the Goupil house in
    Paris], is the wish of</p>

    <p>Your very loving brother,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>It is only a very small light, the one in the little
    Sunday-school room in Barndesteeg, but let me keep it burning.
    Even if I should not, however, I do not think that Adler is the
    man to let it go out.</p>
