  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I tore up a letter I had first written you, that's why you
    will get my answer somewhat later. I begin by thanking you for
    the 50 fr., which I appreciate, as I do everything you do for
    me. But as I began to say, your letter disappoints me, as you
    do not comply with my request, for I stick to my opinion that
    the reasons I gave you in my last letter for coming sooner were
    quite logical. But as I will not quarrel about it after all, I
    only beg you to reconsider it.</p>

    <p>With regard to Cormon, it is decidedly better for me to go
    on drawing from the plaster casts than to work out-of-doors,
    because the better I memorize the structure of the figure the
    better I shall be able to follow the course. I shall have to do
    with people who have drawn from the casts for <i>years</i>; if
    I do it for <i>months</i> it will not be too long. I am perhaps
    more daring in dashing things off, and in grasping the whole,
    than many others, because I have always worked from nature.</p>

    <p>But the others may have more knowledge of the nude, for
    which I haven't had the opportunity. The sooner I make up for
    that the better, the more I shall be able to profit from
    working at Cormon's.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">Then my health, I do not eat when I'm working outdoors, and
    I cannot get well. For I frequently relapse; my health is far
    from being what it ought to be.</label></p>

    <p>Now as to the expenses, I believe it will be pretty much the
    same. So just think it over again - we must act, for we must
    put our shoulders to the wheel.</p>

    <p>All the time I have been here, I have had a comrade, an old
    Frenchman, and I have painted his portrait, which Verlat
    approved of, and which you will see. The winter was even worse
    for him than for me, and the poor devil is much worse off than
    I am because his age makes it very critical.<label content="health.general"> Today I went with
    him to the same doctor whom I had been to myself</label>, and probably
    he will have to go to the hospital and undergo an operation,
    which will be decided tomorrow. At last I had persuaded him to
    do it, but he was so nervous about it that it took a long time
    to persuade him to go and hear his sentence.</p>

    <p>He knew that it was going to be rather serious, and he dared
    not entrust himself to the hospital doctor.</p>

    <p>I wonder what will be decided. It is possible that for his
    sake I shall stay here a few days longer in March. After all,
    there is nothing in the world as interesting as people, and one
    can never study them enough. And that's why people like
    Turgenev are such great masters, because they teach us to
    observe.</p>

    <p>The books of today since Balzac, for instance, are different
    from all that was written in the preceding centuries, and
    perhaps more beautiful.</p>

    <p>I am longing especially for Turgenev, because I have read an
    article by Daudet about him, in which both his character and
    his work were analyzed - very beautifully.</p>

    <p>For he is exemplary as a man, and in his old age he was as
    young as ever as far as <i>working on</i> was concerned, for he
    was dissatisfied with himself and always trying to do better
    and better.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, but think it over carefully - it would be such a
    relief if you could see this matter the way I do.</p>

    <p>And I should not insist so much if I did not think it
    necessary to continue drawing from the casts without
    interruption, especially with regard to June. Well, write soon.
    I would much rather paint something else, but as a practical
    matter it cannot be avoided.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Because I think that after all my stay in Antwerp has been
    useful to me I believe that we must go straight on.</p>
