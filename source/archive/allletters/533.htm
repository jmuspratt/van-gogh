  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you a thousand times for your kind letter and the 300
    francs it contained; after some worrying weeks I have just had
    a much better one. And just as worries do not come singly,
    neither do the joys. For just because I am always bowed down
    under this difficulty of paying my landlord, I made up my mind
    to take it gaily. I swore at the said landlord, who after all
    isn't a bad fellow, and told him that to revenge myself for
    paying him so much money for nothing, I would paint the whole
    of his rotten shanty so as to repay myself.<label content="art.technique"> Then to the great
    joy of the landlord, of the postman whom I had already painted,
    of the visiting night prowlers, and of myself, for three nights
    running I sat up to paint and went to bed during the day. I
    often think that the night is more alive and more richly
    coloured than the day.</label></p>

    <p>Now, as for getting back the money I have paid to the
    landlord by my painting, I do not dwell on that, for <art id=0463>the
    picture is one of the ugliest I have done</art>. It is the
    equivalent, though different, of the<art id=0082> &ldquo; Potato
    Eaters.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>I have tried to express the terrible passions of humanity by
    means of red and green.</p>

    <p>The room is blood red and dark yellow with a green billiard
    table in the middle; there are four lemon-yellow lamps with a
    glow of orange and green. Everywhere there is a clash and
    contrast of the most alien reds and greens, in the figures of
    little sleeping hooligans, in the empty dreary room, in violet
    and blue. The blood-red and the yellow-green of the billiard
    table, for instance, contrast with the soft tender Louis XV
    green of the counter, on which there is a rose nosegay. The
    white clothes of the landlord, watchful in a corner of that
    furnace, turn lemon-yellow, or pale luminous green.</p>

    <p>I am making <art id=1463>a drawing of it with the tones in watercolour</art> to send to you
    tomorrow, to give you some idea of it.</p>

    <p>I wrote this week to Gauguin and Bernard, but I did not talk
    about anything but pictures, just so as not to quarrel when
    there is probably nothing to quarrel about.</p>

    <p>But whether Gauguin comes or not, if I were to get some
    furniture, henceforth I should have, whether in a good spot or
    a bad one is another matter, a pied &agrave; terre, a home of
    my own, which frees the mind from the dismalness of finding
    oneself in the streets. That is nothing when you are an
    adventurer of twenty, but it is bad when you have turned
    thirty-five.</p>

    <p>Today in the Intransigeant I noticed the suicide of M. Bing
    Levy. It can't be the Levy, Bing's manager, can it? I think it
    must be someone else.</p>

    <p>I am greatly pleased that Pissarro thought something of the
    <art id=0431>&ldquo;Young Girl.&rdquo;</art> Did Pissarro say anything about the
    <art id=0422>&ldquo;Sower&rdquo;?</art> Afterwards, when I have gone further in
    these experiments, the &ldquo;Sower&rdquo; will still be the
    first attempt in that style. The &ldquo;Night
    Caf&eacute;&rdquo; carries on from the &ldquo;Sower,&rdquo; and
    so also do <art id=0444>the head of the old peasant</art> and of <art id=0462>the poet</art>, if I
    manage to do this latter picture.</p>

    <p>It is colour not locally true from the point of view of the
    trompe d'oeil realist, but colour to suggest some emotion of an
    ardent temperament.</p>

    <p>When Paul Mantz saw at the exhibition the violent and
    inspired sketch by Delacroix that we saw at the Champs
    Elys&eacute;es - <art id=elacroix>the &ldquo;Bark of Christ&rdquo;</art> - he turned
    away from it, exclaiming in his article: &ldquo;I did not know
    that one could be so terrible with a little blue and
    green.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Hokusai wrings the same cry from you, but he does it by his
    <i>line</i><i>,</i> his <i>drawing</i>; as you say in your
    letter - &ldquo;the waves are claws and the ship is caught in
    them, you feel it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, if you make the colour exact or the drawing exact, it
    won't give you sensations like that.</p>

    <p>Anyhow, very soon, tomorrow or next day, I will write to you
    again about this and answer your letter, and send you the
    sketch of the &ldquo;Night Caf&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Tasset's parcel has arrived. I will write tomorrow on this
    question of the coarse grained colour.</label> Milliet is coming to see
    you and pay his respects to you one of these days, he writes to
    me that he is coming back.</p>

    <p>Thank you again for the money you sent. If I went first to
    look for another place, would it not very likely mean fresh
    expense, equal at least to the expense of a removal? And then
    should I find anything better all at once? I am so very glad to
    be able to do the furnishing, and it can't but help me on. Many
    thanks then, and a good handshake, till tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent.</p>
