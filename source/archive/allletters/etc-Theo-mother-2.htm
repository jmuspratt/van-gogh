  <body>
    <p>Last Monday I have started work immediately and it has done
    me good, but it took all my time and there were friends in the
    evening or I was too tired. If that had not been the case you
    would have heard from me sooner, for my hurried line of last
    week was of no importance and there still are so many things I
    have to tell you. In the first place that Durand-Ruel came with
    me one morning to see Vincent's work, he stayed more than an
    hour and then had to leave, for he has not yet seen one of his
    works from Auvers since those are at Tanguy's. What he saw he
    found very artistic and very remarkable, but he is still
    hesitating about an exhibition in his gallery as he is afraid
    that it will start a controversy, particularly amongst the
    artists and literary people, whether he is either a great
    artist or not and that the general public, which is unable to
    understand this, may take sides against him and Durand-Ruel. He
    suggested himself if I could receive him again next week to see
    them once more and also look at the other ones. Proofs of
    friendship and admiration of his talent and character are still
    coming in. Pissarro is in town and he saw the latest paintings
    and was full of admiration; he immediately wanted to make an
    exchange against a painting that pleased him. I don't know if
    you remember, Wil. <art id=0637>A mulberry tree golden yellow in the autumn
    against a blue sky</art><sup>1</sup>. Bernard had
    said to Dries [Bonger] when they went to Paris after the
    funeral, that he absolutely regarded Vincent as a master. There
    was also Serret, you know Wil, the one who makes such beautiful
    little drawings of children. We have one hanging in our drawing
    room. He was with me at Tanguy's and he was so very much moved
    when he saw his last work. He spoke nothing but good of it and
    Serret happens to be someone who looks through people and sees
    farther than most. I had to tell him everything and he asked me
    a lot of questions about Dad and Mum to find out where he got
    such masterly talent and genius from. I wish you had heard him
    speak, it was marvellous to hear him. Then we had Dr. Gachet to
    dinner last Wednesday. I will send you a letter one of these
    days which you should read to see something of what he thinks
    of him. After the funeral he has been ill from emotion, but he
    was somewhat better then. While he was ill he wrote about
    Vincent and he will let it appear sometime in a magazine. It
    may be good. Aurier is not home yet. In the latest issue of the
    Mercure de France there has been a short article about Vincent
    by one of his friends but it is not good. It says much in his
    favour, that is true, but it belittles his personality and
    reduces the seriousness of the contents by introducing me into
    it and now half of it looks like an advertisement by a
    tradesman. Still, I will send it sometime, but keep it for
    yourself. Dr. Gachet brought me a sketch in pencil after a
    portrait of Vincent, which he had made as an exercise for the
    etching he wanted to make later on, as well as a small drawing
    of a sunflower. He stayed that evening till twelve and there
    came no end to his admiration for the things of Vincent that I
    was able to show him. He promised to return in a fortnight or
    so&hellip;</p>

        <p>Apparently Camille Pissarro was successful in getting
        the painting, for it was recorded as being in the
        collection of Mme. Pissarro in 1901.</p>
