  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your last letter. From home I heard that you have
    visited Mauve already; it must have been a pleasant day -
    sometime I hope to hear the particulars from you.</p>

    <p>Enclosed is a contribution to your collection, three
    lithographs after Bosboom and two by J. Weissenbruch; I found
    them this morning at a bookstall. Do you think the one after
    Bosboom can be the church in Scheveningen? The other one is the
    Great Church at Breda, and the third is after his picture at
    the Great exhibition in Paris. Those two by Weissenbruch struck
    me; perhaps you have them already, but maybe not. Keep right on
    collecting such prints, and books too. I am making a collection
    of Latin and Greek themes, also that of texts that report on
    history, etc. I am at the moment copying one on the
    Reformation, which is quite long.</p>

    <p>The other day I met a young man who had just passed his
    entrance examination for Leyden University. It is not easy - he
    told me what they had asked him. But I must keep courage; with
    God's help I will pass, and the other examinations too. Mendes
    has given me hope that at the end of three months we shall have
    accomplished what he had planned we should if everything goes
    well. But Greek lessons in the heart of Amsterdam, in the heart
    of the Jewish quarter, on a hot and stifling summer afternoon,
    with the feeling that many difficult examinations await you,
    arranged by very learned and shrewd professors - I can tell you
    they can be more oppressive than the Brabant cornfields; which
    are lovely on a day like today! But as Uncle Jan says, we must
    always &ldquo;push on.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>A few days ago two children fell into the water near the
    Kattenburg Bridge. Uncle saw it and ordered out a boat from the
    Makassar which was tied at the dock. They dragged the little
    boy out. Two ship's doctors whom Uncle sent for and I
    accompanied the men who carried the little boy to the
    drugstore; every effort was made to revive the child, but in
    vain. Meanwhile, the father, who is stoker at the yard,
    recognized the little body, and they carried it home in a
    blanket. They continued searching for an hour and a half,
    thinking the little girl had also been drowned, but fortunately
    that seems not to have been the case.</p>

    <p>That evening when I went to see those people once more, it
    was already dark in the house; the little body was lying so
    still on a bed in the little parlour - he was such a pretty
    little boy. <label subject="attitude.death">The sorrow was great; he had been the light of the
    house, as it were, and the light had now been extinguished.
    Though rough people express their sorrow crudely and without
    dignity, like this mother, one still feels deeply in a house of
    mourning, and the spell remained with me the whole evening,
    while I took a long walk.</label></p>

    <p>Last Sunday morning I took a fine walk. First I went to
    morning service - the Reverend Mr. Posthumus Meyes in the North
    Church - then to Bicker's Island, where I walked along the dyke
    by the Ij until it was church time again, and then to the
    Island Church, where Uncle Stricker preached.</p>

    <p>So time passes - and quickly, too - we are almost at the end
    of the week. How are you, boy? Every day I think of you so very
    often. May God help us in our struggle to keep straight; you
    are right in associating with good artists - I, too, cling fast
    to the memory of many of them.</p>

    <p>It is written, &ldquo;Conquer the evil with the good.&rdquo;
    We may strive after that, and God can help us. He can make the
    days bearable for us with many good things, and He can spare us
    too much self-reproach.</p>

    <p>The afternoon of the accident when Uncle Jan ordered the
    boat and the doctors to the rescue, I saw him in his
    element.</p>

    <p>Before I go to work, I want to fill this sheet of paper.
    Generally I get up at a very early hour; before the sun rises
    over the naval yard and the labourers arrive, my window offers
    me a magnificent spectacle, I wish you were here. Will it be
    given me one day to work on a morning such as this to write a
    sermon on these themes: &ldquo;He makes the sun shine on the
    wicked and the good,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Awake, you who sleep,
    and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
    light,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It is right to praise the Lord in the
    early morning and it is good for the eyes to see the sun&rdquo;
    [sic. 1 Chron. 23:30; Eccles. 11:7]. I think the sun never
    shines more beautifully than in a parsonage or in a church. It
    is delightful to study the Bible so early in the morning.</p>

    <p>If you have time and a stamp and paper, write me soon. Uncle
    Jan sends you his compliments.</p>

    <p>The evening in the dunes which you describe must have been
    fine. In the gallery at Uncle Cor's the other day I saw
    &ldquo;The Evangels&rdquo; by Bida [Painter of Eastern
    subjects, pupil of Delacroix's]; how beautiful it is - it is
    impossible to describe. Much of it reminds one of
    Rembrandt.</p>

    <p>With best wishes and a handshake in thought, believe me
    always,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
