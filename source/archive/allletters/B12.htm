  <body>
    <p>My dear friend Bernard,</p>

    <p>Many, many thanks for the drawings you sent me. I very much
    like the avenue of plane trees along the seashore with the two
    women talking in the foreground and people strolling about. And
    the woman under the apple tree, the woman with the umbrella.
    Then the four drawings of nude women, especially the one who is
    washing herself, a grey effect, enhanced with black, white,
    yellow, brown. It's charming.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Ah, Rembrandt! ...With all due admiration for Baudelaire, I
    venture to presume, especially going by those verses, that he
    knew virtually nothing about Rembrandt. Not long ago I found
    and bought a small etching after Rembrandt here, a study of a
    male nude, realistic and simple. He stands, leaning against a
    door or a pillar, in a dark interior, a shaft of light from
    above glancing across his bent head and thick red hair. A
    Degas, you would say, because the animality of the body is real
    and intensely felt. But listen, have you ever taken a
    <i>good</i> look at the &ldquo;Ox&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Interior
    of a Butcher's Shop&rdquo; in the Louvre? You haven't taken a
    really good look at them, have you, and Baudelaire infinitely
    less so. It would be a real treat for me to spend a morning
    with you in the Dutch Gallery. All those things are almost
    impossible to describe, but standing in front of the paintings
    I should be able to point out the miracles and mysteries which
    are the reason why the primitives do not necessarily take first
    place in my admiration.</label></p>

    <p>But then, I am scarcely an eccentric; a Greek statue, a
    peasant by Millet, a Dutch portrait, a female nude by Courbet
    or Degas, these calm and perfectly modelled representations are
    the reason why very many other things, the primitives no less
    than the Japanese, give me the impression of having been
    <i>composed</i> <i>with the pen</i>. I find that immensely
    interesting, but anything complete and perfect renders infinity
    tangible, and the enjoyment of any beautiful thing is like
    coitus, a moment of infinity.</p>

    <p>Do you, for instance, know a painter called Vermeer, who,
    among other things, painted a very beautiful and pregnant Dutch
    lady? The palette of this remarkable painter is blue, lemon
    yellow, pearl grey, black, white. Of course, all the riches of
    a full palette are there too, in his rarely encountered
    pictures, but the combination of lemon yellow, pale blue and
    pearl grey is as characteristic of him - black, white, grey and
    pink are of Vel&aacute;squez.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I know perfectly well that Rembrandt and the Dutch
    painters are scattered widely over museums and collections, and
    it isn't very easy to get an overall idea of them if you only
    know the Louvre. Yet it is the French, Charles Blanc,
    Thor&eacute;, Fromentin and several others, who have written
    about their art better than the Dutch have.</p>

    <p>Those Dutch painters had hardly any imagination or fantasy,
    but an enormous amount of taste and a feeling for composition
    They did no paintings of Christ, Our Lord, etc. - Rembrandt
    did, of course, but he was the only one (and biblical subjects
    are relatively rare in his work). He was the only one who,
    exceptionally, painted figures of Christ, etc. And with him,
    they look quite unlike anything done by other religious
    painters, it is all metaphysical magic</p>

    <p>This is how Rembrandt painted angels. He does a
    self-portrait, old, toothless, wrinkled, wearing a cotton cap,
    a picture from life, in a mirror. He is dreaming, dreaming, and
    his brush takes up his self-portrait again, but this time from
    memory, and the expression on the face becomes sadder and more
    saddening, He dreams, dreams on, and why or how I cannot tell,
    but - as Socrates and Mohammed had their guardian spirits, so
    Rembrandt paints a supernatural angel with a da Vinci smile
    behind that old man who resembles himself</p>

    <p>I am showing you a painter who dreams and paints from the
    imagination, and I started by contending that it is
    characteristic of the Dutch that they do not invent anything,
    that they have neither imagination nor fantasy.</p>

    <p>Am I being illogical? No.</p>

    <p>Rembrandt did not invent anything, and that angel and that
    strange Christ came about because he knew them, felt that they
    were there.</p>

    <p>Delacroix paints a Christ using the unexpected note of
    bright lemon yellow in such a way that the colourful and
    radiant note in the picture assumes the inexpressible
    strangeness and charm of a star in a corner of the firmament
    Rembrandt works with tonal values in the same way that
    Delacroix works with colours</p>

    <p>Well now, there is a world of difference between the method
    used by Delacroix and Rembrandt and that of all other religious
    painters.</p>

    <p>I'll write again soon. This is to thank you for the
    drawings, which have given me enormous pleasure. I have just
    finished <art id=0431>a portrait of a girl of 12, brown eyes, black hair and
    black eyebrows, yellowish-grey flesh, white background,
    strongly tinged with Veronese green, a blood-red bodice with
    violet stripes. Blue skin with large orange polka dots, an
    oleander flower in the sweet little hand</art>. <label contnet="health.fatigue">It
    has exhausted me so much that I am hardly in a fit state to
    write. </label>Goodbye for now, and once more many thanks,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
