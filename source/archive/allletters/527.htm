    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Would you like to ask Tasset's opinion on the following
    question? To me it seems as though the more finely a colour is
    brayed, the more it becomes saturated with oil. Now needless to
    say, we don't care overmuch for oil.</p>

    <p>If we painted like M. G&eacute;r&ocirc;me and the other
    delusive photographers, we should doubtless ask for very finely
    brayed colours. But we on the contrary do not object to the
    canvas having a rough look. If then, instead of braying the
    colour on a stone for God knows how many hours, it was brayed
    just long enough to make it manageable, without worrying too
    much about the fineness of the powder, you would get fresher
    colours which would perhaps darken less. If he wants to make a
    trial of it with the three chromes, the malachite, the
    vermilion, the orange lead, the cobalt, and the ultramarine, I
    am almost certain that at much less cost I should get colours
    which would be fresher and more lasting. Then what would the
    price be? I'm sure this could be done. Probably also with the
    reds and the emerald, which are transparent.</p>

    <p>I enclose an order which is urgent.</label></p>

    <p>I am now on the fourth picture of sunflowers. This <art id=0458>fourth
    one is a bunch of 14 flowers, against a yellow
    background</label>, like <art id=0383>a still life of quinces and lemons that I did
    some time ago</art>.</p>

    <p>Only as it is much bigger, it gives a rather singular
    effect, and I think that this one is painted with more
    simplicity than the quinces and lemons.</p>

    <p>Do you remember that one day we saw a very extraordinary
    Manet at the Hotel Drouot, <art id=anet>some huge pink peonies with their
    green leaves against a light background?</art> As free in the open
    air and as much a flower as anything could be, and yet painted
    in a perfectly solid impasto, and not the way Jeannin does
    it.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">That's what I'd call simplicity of technique. And I must
    tell you that nowadays I am trying to find a special brushwork
    without stippling or anything else, nothing but the varied
    stroke.</label> But someday you'll see.</p>

    <p>What a pity painting costs so much! This week I had fewer
    worries than other weeks, so I let myself go. I shall have
    spent the 100-fr. note in a single week, but at the end of this
    week I'll have my four pictures, and even if I add the cost of
    all the paint I have used, the week will not have been sheer
    waste.<label content="health.general"> I have got up very early every day, I have had a good
    dinner and supper, and so I have been able to work hard and
    long without feeling myself weaken.</label> But there, we live in days
    when there is no demand for what we are making, not only does
    it not sell, but as you see in Gauguin's case, when you want to
    borrow on the pictures, you can't get anything, even if it is a
    trifling sum and the work, important. And that is why we are
    the prey of every happening. And I am afraid that it will
    hardly change in our lifetime. But if we are preparing richer
    lives for the painters who will follow in our footsteps, it
    will be something.</p>

    <p>But life is short, and shorter still, the number of years
    you feel bold enough to face everything.</p>

    <p>And in the end it is to be feared that as soon as the new
    painting is appreciated, the painters will go soft.</p>

    <p>But anyway, this much is positive, it is not we of the
    present time who are decadent. Gauguin and Bernard talk now of
    &ldquo;painting like children&rdquo; - I would rather have that
    than &ldquo;painting like decadents.&rdquo; How is it that
    people see something decadent in impressionism? It is very much
    the reverse.</p>

    <p>I enclose a line for Tasset. The difference in price ought
    to be considerable, and needless to say, I hope to make less
    and less use of the finely brayed colours.</p>

    <p>With a handshake.</p>

    <p>One of the decorations of <art id=0459>sunflowers on royal blue ground</art>
    has &ldquo;a halo,&rdquo; that is to say each
    object is surrounded by a glow of the complementary colour of
    the background against which it stands out. Goodbye for
    now.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
