  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>A few words to congratulate you on September 10 [their
    Mother's birthday]. I do not know if I have already told you
    that I have had a letter from Willemien, who describes the
    country around Nuenen very prettily.</p>

    <p>It seems to be very beautiful there.</p>

    <p>I have asked her for some particulars about the weavers, who
    interest me very much. I saw them when I was in the
    Pas-de-Calais - it was indescribably beautiful. However, I need
    not paint weavers yet, though I certainly hope to sooner or
    later.</p>

    <p>It is autumn now in the woods, it quite absorbs me.</p>

    <p>There are two things in autumn which particularly appeal to
    me.</p>

    <p>There is sometimes a soft melancholy in the falling leaves,
    in the tempered light, in the haziness of things, in the
    elegance of the slender stems.</p>

    <p>But I also love the other, more sturdy and rugged, side -
    those strong light effects, for instance, on a man who stands
    digging and perspiring in the midday sun. Enclosed a few
    sketches I made this week.</p>

    <p>I was thinking again about those workmen on Montmartre whom
    you described in your last letter. I knew there was somebody
    who had made those things remarkably well.</p>

    <p>I mean A. Lan&ccedil;on. I looked over his wood engravings
    in my collection - how clever that man is. Among them I found
    &ldquo;Gathering of Ragpickers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Soup
    Distribution,&rdquo; &ldquo;Snow-Clearing Gang,&rdquo; which I
    think are splendid. He is so very productive that they seem
    simply to drop out of his sleeve.</p>

    <p>Speaking of wood engravings, this week I found some
    beautiful new ones in L'Illustration. It is a series by Paul
    Renouard: &ldquo;Les prisons de Paris&rdquo;; what beautiful
    things are among them!</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.insomnia">At night when I cannot sleep, which often happens, I always
    look at the wood engravings with renewed pleasure.</label></p>

    <p>Another famous draughtsman is G. Mahoney, who illustrated
    the Household Edition of Dickens.</p>

    <p>I think that painting will teach me to interpret the light
    better, which should bring a great change in my drawings,
    too.</p>

    <p>How many difficulties have to be overcome before one can
    express something, but those very difficulties are the
    stimulus.</p>

    <p>Enclosed is another sketch of the woods. I made <art id=008>a large
    study of it</art>.</p>

    <p><?showImage("257_V-T_2290");?>
    </p>

    <p>I feel such creative power in myself that I know for sure
    that the time will arrive when, so to speak, I shall regularly
    make something good every day.</p>

    <p>But very rarely a day passes that I do not make something,
    though it is not yet the real thing I want to make.</p>

    <p>Well, sometimes it seems to me that I might soon become
    productive. I would not be at all surprised if it should happen
    someday.</p>

    <p>I feel that at all events painting will indirectly rouse
    other things in me too.</p>

    <p>Look, for instance, at this <art id=1091>little sketch of the potato
    market on the North Wall</art>. That bustling of the
    workmen and the women, with the baskets being loaded from the
    barge, is very intriguing to look at. Those are the things I
    should want to draw and paint vigorously - the life and
    movement in such a scene, and the types of people. But I am not
    surprised that I cannot do it at once, and that up to now I
    have often failed when I tried. By painting I shall certainly
    become more proficient with the colours and better able to take
    on such a subject.</p>

    <p>Well, to have patience and to work on, that is the question.
    I am sending you the little sketch - I make a lot of them in
    this way - just to tell you that indeed, things like that scene
    of the workmen on Montmartre, for instance, preoccupy me too. A
    general knowledge of the figure is needed for it, which I try
    to acquire by drawing large figure studies. And I firmly
    believe that if I continue doing this, I shall learn to express
    the bustle of labourers in the streets or in the fields.</p>

    <p>That potato market is such a curious place. All the poor
    people from the Geest, from the Ledig Erf, and all those places
    in the neighborhood, come running out. There are always such
    scenes - one time it is a barge full of peat, then one with
    fish, then one with coal or something or other. I have a great
    many sketches of Ireland by English artists. I think the
    quarter I'm writing you about must be very much like an Irish
    town.</p>

    <p>I always try my best to put all my energy into my work, for
    my greatest desire is to make beautiful things. But making
    beautiful things costs trouble and disappointment and
    perseverance.</p>

    <p><?showImage("257_V-T_2291");?>
    </p>

    <p>I enclose another view of the wood in the evening after the
    rain. I cannot tell you how splendid that effect was in nature,
    with the green turned to bronze, and here and there the fallen
    leaves.</p>

    <p>I wish you could walk here some evening in this splendid
    autumn wood. What I bring back from it this year will be just a
    scanty harvest. However, I hope to bring a few things, and in
    time it will grow more and more.</p>

    <p>In the meantime all my paint has been used up. I sincerely
    hope that you yourself are not hard up. But at all events I
    hope you will send the usual allowance around September 10.
    This afternoon I must go to the potato market again. It is
    impossible to paint there because of the people; they already
    give me trouble enough. I wish one could have free access to
    the houses and sit down by the windows without ceremony. Well,
    it is Saturday night, and so there will certainly be something
    characteristic going on worth looking at. I wish you all good
    luck, know that I think of you daily. Adieu, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
