    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>A feeling, even a fine feeling, for the beauties of Nature
    is not the same as a religious feeling, though I believe these
    two are connected. *</p>

    <p>Nearly everyone has a feeling for nature, some more, some
    less, but there are some who feel: God is a Spirit, and they
    that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.
    Father is one of those few, Mother too, and Uncle Vincent as
    well, I think.</p>

    <p>You know that it is written: &ldquo;The world passeth away
    and the lust thereof&rdquo;, and that on the other hand we are
    also told about &ldquo;that good part which shall not be taken
    away&rdquo;, and about &ldquo;a well of water springing up into
    everlasting life.&rdquo; Let us also pray that we may grow rich
    in God. Still, do not dwell too deeply on these matters - in
    the fullness of time they will become clearer to you of their
    own accord - and just take the advice I have given you.</p>

    <p>Let us ask that it may fall to us to become the poor in the
    kingdom of God, God's servants. We are still a long way from
    that, however, since there are often beams in our eye that we
    know not of. Let us therefore ask that our eye may become
    single, for then we ourselves shall become wholly single.</p>

    <p>Regards to Roos and to anybody who may ask after me, and
    believe me, always,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">You are eating properly, aren't you? In particular eat
    especially as much bread as you can.</label> Sleep well, I must go and
    polish my boots for tomorrow.</p>

    <p>*The same is true of the feeling for art. Do not succumb too
    much to that either. Above all, save some love for the business
    and for your work, and respect for Mr. Tersteeg. One day you
    will appreciate, better than now, how much he deserves it. No
    need to overdo it, though.</p>
