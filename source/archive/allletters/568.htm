    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Perhaps I shall not write you a very long letter today, but
    anyway a line to let you know that I got back home today. I do
    so regret that you had all that trouble for such a trifle.
    Forgive me, who am after all probably the primary cause of it
    all. I did not foresee that it would be important enough for
    you to be told of it. Enough&hellip; M. Rey came to see the
    paintings with two of his friends, doctors, and they were
    uncommonly quick at understanding at least what complementaries
    are. I now intend to do a portrait of M. Rey and possibly other
    portraits as soon as I am a little used to painting again.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your last letter. Indeed, I always feel your
    presence, but do realise on your side too that I am working at
    the same thing as yourself.</p>

    <p>How I wish you had seen the portrait of Brias by Delacroix
    and the whole Montpellier Mus&eacute;e where Gauguin took me.
    Since others before us have worked in the South, indeed it is
    rather difficult for me to believe that we are so far astray as
    all that. As for it's being a hot country, my word, I can't
    help thinking of a certain country Voltaire talks of, not to
    mention the simple &ldquo;castles in the air.&rdquo; These are
    the thoughts which occur to me as I come back to my own
    home.</p>

    <p>I am very anxious to know how the Bongers are and if the
    relations with them continue. I hope so.</p>

    <p>If you agree - now that Gauguin has gone - we will put the
    money back again at 150 fr. I think that now I shall see calmer
    days here than in the past year.</p>

    <p>What I greatly need for my better information are all the
    reproductions of Delacroix's pictures that are still available
    at that shop where they sell, I think at a franc apiece,
    lithographs after artists, ancient and modern, etc. I <i>most
    certainly</i> don't want the more expensive ones.</p>

    <p>How are our Dutch friends De Haan and Isa&auml;cson? Give
    them my very kind regards.</p>

    <p>Only I think that we must still keep quiet with regard to my
    own painting. If you want any pictures, certainly I can send
    you some already, but when my peace of mind comes back to me, I
    hope to do different things. However, as to the Independents,
    do what seems best to you, and what the others do.</p>

    <p>But you have no idea how much I regret that your journey to
    Holland has not yet come off.</p>

    <p>After all, we cannot alter what has happened, but make up
    for it yourself by letter, or any way you can, as far as
    possible, and tell the Bongers how I regret having
    involuntarily caused this delay. I shall be writing Mother and
    Wil one of these days, and I must also write Jet Mauve.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">Write me soon, and set your mind at rest about my health. It
    will completely cure me to know that things are going well with
    you.</label> What is Gauguin doing? As his family are in the North, and
    he has been invited to exhibit in Belgium and now has some
    success in Paris, I like to think that he has landed on his
    feet. A good handshake. In spite of everything I am terribly
    happy that this is a thing of the <i>past</i>. Once more
    a good hearty handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever Yours, Vincent</p>
