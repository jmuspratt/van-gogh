    <p>[Postcard, written in English]</p>

    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>Today or tomorrow being the 1<sup>st</sup> of June, I
    promised to pay my landlord 5 guilders rent of studio for the
    month of April + 7.50 guilders for last month, makes 12.50
    guilders.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">But not having up to now received any letter of yours since
    that of May 12<sup>th</sup>, I have nothing to pay him his
    twelve guilders and 50 c. with. The man will surely not give me
    any longer delay, but they can immediately sell my furniture
    publicly.</label> Whatever may be your opinion concerning the things I
    told you do not let it come to this scandal, my drawings for C.
    M. are ready, but I shall not be able to get that money early
    enough. I say again, let us at all events avoid irregularity
    and public scandal, and talk and write calmly on the subject,
    till we know what ought to be done. Therefore I hope you will
    send me what I so greatly want, and will write. I work day and
    night, and have a small drawing ready for you, which I will
    send by and by. I have no money for a stamp, excuse the
    postcard, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours truly, Vincent</p>
