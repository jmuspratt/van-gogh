  <body>
    <p>Dear Sir,</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">Your brother, whom we had believed more or less
    cured and who had taken up his usual work once more, has again lately shown signs of
    mental distress.</label> <label content="fear.paranoia">For three days he has imagined that he is
    being poisoned and is seeing nothing but poisoners and poisoned people
    everywhere. </label>The cleaning woman, who looks after him with a certain devotion,
    noticing his more than abnormal state, considered it her duty to report it - and the
    neighbors bought it to the attention of the central commissioner. This man put your
    brother under surveillance, and this afternoon had him driven to the hospital, where he has
    been placed in an isolation cell. I have just seen him and his state made a very painful
    impression on me. He has withdrawn into absolute muteness, hides himself under
    his bedcovers and sometimes cries without uttering a word.
    Today, according to the cleaning woman, he has refused all food; all day yesterday and this
    morning he has spoken little and at times his behaviour has frightened this poor woman, who
    told me that while he was in this state she could not continue to look after him.</p>

    <p>What are we to do now? After I met with the bursar, the intern and doctor Deloy,
    it was decided that I would write to you to get your opinion. Obviously it is necessary
    that your brother is put under constant supervision and also receive the special care that can only be given
    to him in a nursing home or by the family. He cannot remain in the hospital; he would only be
    cared for poorly there, although they have agreed to keep him for several days more. Tell me
    if you want to have him close to you or at least in a home located in the neighbourhood of
    the capital. In this case, the cleaning woman could get a permit for Paris (her husband being
    an employee at the train station) and she would gladly accompany him. In any case it is
    necessary to make a quick decision, and we will only act after having received your answer.</p>

    <p>I regret, Sir, having to give you such distressing news. Be assured that I will do everything
    in my power to ease your brother's situation the entire time that he is locked up in the hospital.
    Tonight I saw that a fire was lit in his cell, for it felt very cold to me, and that someone keeps
    it going all night. We will see tomorrow if we can install him in a better room.</p>

    <p>My very cordial greetings, and believe me, your devoted in Christ, Salles.</p>
