  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just received your letter and the enclosed 50 fr.,
    for which my warm thanks. A few small watercolours are again
    enclosed.</p>

    <p>As you will remember, when you were here, you spoke about my
    someday trying to send you a little drawing of a
    &ldquo;saleable&rdquo; nature. However, you must excuse my not
    knowing exactly when a drawing is, and when it is not, that
    kind. I used to think I knew, but now I perceive daily that I
    am mistaken.</p>

    <p>Well, I hope this <art id=952>little bench</art>, though
    perhaps not yet saleable, will show you that I am not averse to
    choosing subjects sometimes which are pleasant or attractive
    and, as such, will find buyers sooner than things of a more
    gloomy sentiment.</p>

    <p>I enclose with the little bench another one as a pendant [JH
    195], also a part of the wood. I struck off the little bench
    after <art id=951>the larger watercolour I am working on</art>, in which there
    are deeper tones, but I do not know whether I shall succeed in
    finishing it well [JH 196]. The other sketch is after a painted
    study.</p>

    <p>Now I should like to hear from you if this little drawing is
    more or less the kind we spoke about. I send it to you because
    I should not want you to think I had forgotten, but later I
    hope to send you some better things.</p>

    <p>You remember I wrote you in my last letter that I was going
    to the potato market.</p>

    <p>I brought home many sketches that time, it was
    extraordinarily intriguing - but it may serve as an example of
    The Hague public's politeness towards painters that suddenly a
    fellow from behind me, or probably from a window, spat his quid
    of tobacco onto my paper. Well, one has trouble enough
    sometimes. But one need not take it so very seriously; those
    people are not bad, they do not understand anything about it,
    and probably think I am a lunatic when they see me making a
    drawing with large hooks and crooks which don't mean anything
    to them.</p>

    <p>Recently I have also been very busy drawing <art id=952>horses in the
    street</art>. I would love to have a horse for a
    model sometime. Yesterday, for instance, I heard someone behind
    me say, That's a queer sort of painter - he draws the horse's
    ass instead of drawing it from the front. I rather liked that
    comment.</p>

    <p>I love to make those sketches in the street, and as I wrote
    you in my last letter, I certainly want to reach a sort of
    perfection in it.</p>

    <p>Do you know an American magazine called Harper's Monthly?
    There are wonderful sketches in it. I myself know it only
    slightly. I have seen only six numbers, and possess but three
    of them. But there are things in it which strike me dumb with
    admiration, including &ldquo;Glassworks&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;Foundry,&rdquo; all scenes from factories. And also
    sketches of a Quaker town in the olden days by Howard Pyle. I
    am full of new pleasure in those things, because I have new
    hope of making things that have soul in them myself.</p>

    <p>What you write about the money you lent and did not get back
    is indeed a calamity. I still have to pay for some colours, and
    have to buy more, so that by September 20 I shall certainly be
    short. But I am going to vary the work a little, and try to
    make both ends meet. But please remember that a little extra
    money will help me make extra progress - more than would
    otherwise be the case.</p>

    <p>One needs so many things and everything is so expensive.
    But, at all events, I am doubly thankful to you, and feel I am
    so much luckier than the others because of the money I receive
    from you; and I assure you that I try very hard to make
    progress.</p>

    <p>Today I shall again go to the usual Monday market, to try
    and make some sketches when they are pulling down the
    stalls.</p>

    <p>Adieu, good luck in everything, write me soon and know that
    I always love to read a description like the one of
    Montmartre.</p>

    <p>I am messing around so much with paint that there is even
    paint on this letter. I am busy with the large watercolour of
    the bench.</p>

    <p>I wish it would turn out well, but the great trouble is to
    keep the correct form together with depth of tone; and it is
    very difficult to keep clear.</p>

    <p>Once more adieu, a handshake in thought, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Thank you very much for sending me the money when you
    yourself are so very hard up. I doubly need it because autumn
    will be over so soon, and it is the most beautiful season for
    painting.</p>
