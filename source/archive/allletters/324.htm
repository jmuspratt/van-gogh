  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Now that I have been here for a few days and have done a
    good deal of walking about in various directions, I can tell
    you more about the area in which I have ended up. I am
    enclosing a quick little scratch of the first study I painted
    here, a cottage on the heath. A cottage made entirely of turfs
    and sticks. I have seen the inside of some 6 or so like this,
    too, and more studies of them will follow.</p>

    <p>I can't convey the way they look outside in the dusk or just
    after sunset better than by reminding you of a certain painting
    by Jules Dupr&eacute;, which I think belongs to Mesdag and
    shows two cottages, their moss-covered roofs standing out
    surprisingly deep in tone against a misty, hazy evening sky.
    <i>That could have been here.</i></p>

    <p>Inside, these cottages, dark as a cave, are very beautiful.
    There are drawings by certain English artists who have worked
    on the moors in Ireland that portray most realistically what I
    have found here. Alb. Neuhuys does the same with somewhat more
    poetry than is apparent at first sight, but he never does
    anything that is not basically true.</p>

    <p>I saw some superb figures in the country - striking in their
    sobriety. A woman's breast, for instance, has that heaving
    movement which is the exact opposite of volupt&eacute;
    [voluptuousness], and sometimes, when the creature is old or
    ailing, can arouse compassion or respect. And the melancholy
    which things in general have here is of a healthy kind, as in
    drawings by Millet. Fortunately, the men here wear short
    breeches, which show the shape of the leg and give the
    movements more expression.</p>

    <p>To mention one of the many fresh impressions and feelings I
    have gained on my exploratory outings, let me tell you for
    instance about the barges drawn by men, women, children, white
    or black horses, laden with peat, <i>in the middle of the
    heath</i>, just like the ones you see in Holland, say on the
    Rijs-wijk towpath.</p>

    <p>The heath is magnificent. I've seen sheepfolds and shepherds
    more beautiful than those in Brabant. The ovens are more or
    less as in Th. Rousseau's four communal [communal oven], and
    stand in the gardens under old apple trees or among the
    cabbages and the celery. Beehives, too, in many places.</p>

    <p>One sees many individuals who have something wrong with them
    - I think it can't be very healthy here, perhaps because of
    foul drinking water. I have seen a few girls of perhaps 17 or
    even younger with something lovely and youthful about them,
    whose features were striking, but more often than not they look
    fan&eacute; [faded] at an early age. Still, that does not
    detract from the fine and noble bearing of some of the figures,
    even if they do appear quite faded when seen from close to.</p>

    <p>There are 4 or 5 canals in the village, to Meppel, to
    Dedemsvaart, to Coevorden, to Hollands Veld. Following them,
    one now and then sees a curious old mill, farmhouse, boatyard,
    or lock. And always the bustle of peat barges.</p>

    <p>To give you an example of the true character in these parts:
    as I sat painting that cottage, two sheep and a goat came and
    started to graze <i>on the roof</i> of the house. The goat
    climbed up on to the ridge and looked down the chimney. The
    woman, who had heard something on the roof, rushed out and
    flung her broom at the said goat, which leaped down like a
    chamois.</p>

    <p>The two hamlets on the heath where I went and where this
    incident occurred are called Stiufzand [Shifting Sand] and
    Swartschaap [Black sheep]. I have been to various other places
    too, and you'll have some idea now of how primitive it all is
    here - Hoogeveen is apr&egrave;s tout [after all] a town and
    yet right next to it one has shepherds, those ovens, those turf
    huts, etc.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.guilt">I often think with melancholy of the woman and the children,
    if only they were provided for; oh, it's the woman's fault, one
    might say, and it would be true, but I am afraid her
    misfortunes will prove greater than her guilt. I knew from the
    beginning that her character was spoiled, but I hoped she would
    improve; and now that I do not see her any more and ponder some
    things I saw in her, it seems to me more that she was too far
    gone for improvement. And this only increases my feeling of
    pity, and it becomes a melancholy feeling because it is not in
    my power to redress it.</p>

    <p>Theo, when I meet on the heath such a poor woman with a
    child on her arm, or at her breast, my eyes get moist. It
    reminds me of her, her weakness; her untidiness, too,
    contributes to making the likeness stronger. <i>I know that she
    is not good</i>, that I have an absolute right to act as
    I do, that I <i>could not</i> stay with her back there, that I
    really <i>could not</i> take her with me, that what I did was
    even sensible and wise, whatever you like; but, for all that,
    it cuts right through me when I see such a poor little figure
    feverish and miserable, and it makes my heart melt inside.</label></p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">How much sadness
    there is in life, nevertheless one must not
    get melancholy, and one must seek distraction in other things,
    and the right thing is to work, but there are moments when one
    only finds rest in the conviction: &ldquo;Misfortune will not
    spare me either.&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>Goodbye, write soon and believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
