  <body>
    <p>My dear friend,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter, and for that which it contained. I
    feel sad that even successful paintings do not cover
    their costs.</p>

    <p>I was touched by what you wrote about home,
    &ldquo;They are fairly well but yet it is sad to see
    them.&rdquo; A dozen years ago one would have sworn that, come
    what may, the family would always prosper and do well. It would
    give Mother much pleasure if your marriage came off; and you
    also ought not to stay single for the sake of your health and
    business.</p>

    <p>As for me, I feel the desire for marriage and children
    leaving me, and now and then I'm rather depressed that I should
    be like this at 35, when I ought to be feeling quite
    the opposite. And sometimes I blame it all on this rotten
    painting. It was Richepin who said somewhere: the love of art
    is the undoing of true love. I think that's absolutely right,
    but on the other hand true love makes one weary of art.</p>

    <p>And although I already feel old and broken, I can still be amorous
    enough at times to feel less passionate about painting. One
    must have ambition to succeed, and ambition seems to me absurd.
    I wish above all I were less of a burden to you - and that
    needn't be impossible from now on, for I hope to make such
    progress that you'll be able to show what I do in full
    confidence without compromising yourself. And then I'll retire
    somewhere in the Midi so as not to see so many
    painters who fill me with disgust as men.</p>

    <p>You can be sure of one thing - I shan't be trying to do any
    more work for the Tambourin - I think it's about to
    change hands anyway, and I most certainly don't object to that.
    As for la Segatori, that is quite a different matter.
    I still feel affection for her and I hope that she, too, still
    feels some for me. But at the moment she is in a difficult
    situation, she is neither a free agent nor mistress in her own
    house, on top of which she's suffering and sick. Although I
    wouldn't say so in public - I'm convinced she's had an abortion
    (unless, that is, she did have a miscarriage) - whatever, in her
    case I don't hold it against her.</p>

    <p>She'll be better in about two months' time, I hope, and then
    she may well be grateful to me for not having bothered her.
    Mind you, once she's well again, if she refuses in cold blood
    to return what is mine, or does me down in any way, I shan't
    pull my punches - but it won't come to that. After all, I know
    her well enough to still have confidence in her. And mind you, if she does
    manage to hang on to her establishment, then from a business
    point of view I shouldn't blame her for choosing to eat
    rather than be eaten. If that means she has to tread on my
    toes a bit - all right - she can do so. When I saw her
    last, she didn't tread all over my heart, which she would have
    done had she been as mean as people say she is.</p>

    <p>I saw Tanguy yesterday and he has put a canvas I've just
    done in the window. I've done four since you left and I've got
    a big one under way. I realize that these big, long canvases
    are hard to sell, but later on people will see that there's
    fresh air and good humour in them. The whole lot would do well
    as decoration for a dining room or a country house. And if you
    were to fall properly in love and then got married, it
    doesn't seem impossible to me that you might manage to acquire
    a country house like so many other art dealers. If one lives
    well, one spends more, but also gains more ground, and perhaps
    nowadays one does better looking rich than looking hard up.
    It's better to enjoy life than to commit suicide.</p>

    <p>Regards to all at home.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
