  <body>
    <p>Dear Rappard,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your quick reply - so you soon succeeded in
    finding rooms, and are now living near the academy.</p>

    <p>With reference to a certain question, which I descried at
    the bottom of your postcard, I want to tell you that, far from
    thinking it &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; of you to go to the aforesaid
    sanctuary, I think it very wise, even so wise that - yes, that
    I am <i>almost</i> tempted to say, a little bit too wise and
    righteous.</p>

    <p>In my opinion if you had not gone, if your expedition had
    not taken place, it would have been all the better, but since
    you have undertaken it, I wish you success from the bottom of
    my heart, and notwithstanding everything, I have no doubt about
    the good results.</p>

    <p><i>You</i> - and others too - even if you really and truly
    attend the lessons at the academy, you will of course never be
    in my eyes an &ldquo;academician&rdquo; in the despicable
    sense of the word. Of course I do not take you for one of those
    arrogant fellows whom one might call the Pharisees of art, and
    the prototype of whom is, I think, &ldquo;good old&rdquo;
    Stallaert. And yet even this man may have something good in
    him, and if I knew him better, I might think differently of his
    Honour. But it will be difficult to hammer it into my head that
    his Honour does not have something damned bad in him too,
    which eclipses his possible good qualities. Nothing pleases me
    more than discovering good qualities even in such fellows. It
    always hurts me, it always makes me nervous, when I meet a man
    of whose principles I am obliged to say, &ldquo;But this is
    really too bad, this doesn't hold water,&rdquo; and I go on
    having this choking feeling until someday I discover something
    good in him.</p>

    <p>Never think it gives me pleasure to notice something wrong;
    it grieves me and gives me so much pain that at times I cannot
    keep it to myself. Ca m'agace [it exasperates me].</p>

    <p>I do not like catching myself at &ldquo;having a beam in
    mine eye,&rdquo; and yet - yet I have happened to catch myself
    at it, but then I didn't let it go at that, and I tried to
    remedy it.</p>

    <p>And exactly because I know from my own experience how
    terrible such a &ldquo;beam in one's eye&rdquo; is, I
    sympathize with others suffering from the same complaint.</p>

    <p>Please, please do not take me for a fanatic or a partisan.
    Certainly I have the courage to take sides, like any other man;
    at times one is compelled to do so in life, one is
    <i>compelled</i> to speak one's mind and to give one's opinion
    candidly, and stick to it.</p>

    <p>But seeing that I do my utmost to look at the undeniably
    good side of things in the first place, and only afterward,
    most unwillingly, look at the bad side too, I make bold to
    believe that, even if I have not quite succeeded in it, I shall
    eventually arrive at what I may call in general a mild and
    broad and unprejudiced judgment. And therefore it is to me a
    petite mis&egrave;re de la vie humaine to meet a man who thinks
    he is always right, and who demands to be taken for someone who
    is always right; and this is because I am so convinced of my
    own fallibility and, at the same time, of the fallibility of
    all the children of men.</p>

    <p>Now as to you, I believe that you too are striving after a
    mild and broad and unprejudiced judgment of things, in life but
    more especially in art. And therefore nothing is further from
    my mind than looking upon you as a Pharisee, either in the
    moral or in the artistic sense.</p>

    <p>But for all that, such people as you and I, who decidedly
    have honest intentions, are not perfect after all, and often
    make very bad mistakes, and besides, are influenced by their
    environment and by circumstances. And we should be deceiving
    ourselves if we thought we stood so firm in our shoes that we
    had no need to take heed lest we fall.</p>

    <p>You and I &ldquo;think we stand,&rdquo; but malheur a nous
    if we should become foolhardy and careless because we feel sure
    - and rightly so - that we possess some more or less good
    qualities. Attaching too much importance to the good that is in
    us, even if it is really and truly there, may lead us to
    Phariseeism.</p>

    <p>When you are making vigorous studies after the nude like the
    ones you showed me, whether at the academy or somewhere else,
    when I am drawing potato diggers in a field - then we are doing
    good things by which we shall make progress. But, as I see it,
    for all that we must be especially distrustful of ourselves and
    be on our guard against ourselves as soon as we perceive that
    we are on the right road. When we must say: <i>Let me be very
    careful, for I am just the kind of man to spoil things for
    myself when they seem good</i> - unless I am careful. How must
    we be careful???...this I cannot define, but I am most
    decidedly of the opinion that in the case I mentioned, being
    careful is necessary, for from my own bitter experience,
    through my own sufferings and shame, I have become conscious of
    what I underlined just now. The fact that my being conscious of
    my own fallibility will keep me from making many mistakes will
    certainly not prevent my making a great many mistakes after
    all. But after we fall, we stand up again...!</p>

    <p>So I think it a very good thing that you are painting from
    the nude at the academy, just because I am confident that you
    will not consider yourself righteous like the Pharisees on
    account of it, nor think those whose views differ from yours
    insignificant. Your work, far more than your words and
    expressions, has given me this conviction, and it has grown
    stronger and stronger.</p>

    <p>Today, I drew another digger. And also since your visit, a
    boy cutting grass with a sickle [F851, JH 061].</p>

    <p>And a man and a woman sitting by the fire besides [F897, JH
    063; F 1216, JH 064].</p>

    <p>We all enjoyed your visit very much; I am so glad to have
    seen your watercolours, you have made progress indeed.</p>

    <p>Yet I should like to see you draw or paint ordinary people
    with their clothes on. I shouldn't be surprised if you made a
    success of it; I often think of that clerk whose portrait you
    drew during the sermon of the Very Reverend and Learned Dr.
    Kam. But since then I have not seen any more drawings by you
    like that one, which I regret - have you been reclaimed, by any
    chance, and are you listening more to the sermon nowadays
    instead of paying attention to the speaker and his audience? In
    some cases the speaker can carry us with him to such an extent
    that we forget everything around us, but this often happens in
    church, and I should wish it were always like that in
    church.</p>

    <p>Well, I hope that you will write soon, and that you will
    have a good time and good luck in Brussels. And don't forget to
    drop in on your return journey, if it is possible; let's agree
    on that as a matter of principle.</p>

    <p>Kind regards from my parents and a handshake in thought from
    me. And believe me</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
