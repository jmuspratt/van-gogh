  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your kind letter and the 100-fr. note
    enclosed.</p>

    <p>I am very glad of Gauguin's success in the matter of the
    continuous sale. If he could have sold enough within a year
    from now to execute his plan to go to settle in Martinique, I
    should think his fortune would be made. Only, as I see it, he
    oughtn't to risk returning there before he has saved 5000
    francs; according to him he will need 2000. But to my mind in
    that case he would not go away by himself but along with
    another man or with other men, and would found a studio there
    for good and all.</p>

    <p>But oh well, till then a lot of water will flow under the
    bridge.</p>

    <p>I am greatly interested in what you write about the
    Dutchmen. I hope to meet both of them personally someday. How
    old are they? I dare hope that ultimately they will find their
    coming to France was a good thing.</p>

    <p>Their having trouble with their colour - damn it - does not
    surprise me; may De Haan never forsake the <i>serious</i> study
    of Rembrandt which the two drawings I am looking at now
    reflect!</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Have they read Silvestre's book on Eug. Delacroix, and also
    the article on colour in the Grammaire des arts du dessin by
    Ch. Blanc? Ask them this for me, and if they have not read
    them, let them do so still. As for me, I am thinking more of
    Rembrandt than might appear from my studies.</label></p>

    <p>[Vincent drew <art id=701_V-T_558a0>a sketch of The Sower here.</art>]</p>

    <p>This is a sketch of the latest canvas I am working on,
    <art id=0450>another Sower. Immense citron-yellow disk for the sun. Sky
    green-yellow with pink clouds. The field violet, the sower and
    the tree Prussian blue. Size 30 canvas</art>. Let's
    quietly postpone exhibiting until I have some thirty size 30
    canvases. Then we are going to exhibit them only once in your
    apartment for our friends, and even then without exercising any
    pressure. And don't let's do anything else.</p>

    <p>There are quite a few reasons not to make a stir at present.
    It won't be for long for that matter, I think that I shall be
    able to send it to you around the time of the exhibition or
    soon after. In the meantime it will dry thoroughly here, and
    then I shall be able to put a finishing touch to all the
    canvases, once they are thoroughly dry even in the thickly
    painted spots.</p>

    <p>At the age of forty when I make a picture of figures or
    portraits in the way I feel it, I think this will be worth more
    than a more or less serious success at present.</p>

    <p>Have you see the studies that Bernard brought back from
    Brittany? - Gauguin told me a lot about them. He himself has
    one that is simply masterly. I think that buying one from
    Bernard would mean doing him a service, and that he really
    deserves it.</p>

    <p>Only you must not forget to return to Gauguin, either at the
    end of the year or in March, the money he may have spent, for
    instance, on sheets and other things that are to remain in the
    studio.</p>

    <p>I think that on all counts it will be a good thing to alter
    nothing, absolutely nothing, in the financial arrangement as it
    is fixed. If after a year things are found to be going
    satisfactorily, then we shall see.</p>

    <p>Gauguin is working on a very beautiful picture of women
    washing, and also on a large still life of an orange-coloured
    pumpkin and apples and white linen on a yellow background and
    foreground.[Painting lost]</p>

    <p>Here the weather is cold, notwithstanding which one sees
    very fine things. For instance yesterday evening an
    extraordinarily beautiful sunset of a mysterious, sickly citron
    colour - Prussian blue cypresses against trees with dead leaves
    in all sorts of broken tones without any speckling with bright
    greens.</p>

    <p>You cannot imagine how much it pleases me that you have
    painters staying with you, and that you are not living all
    alone in your apartment, just as it pleases me very much to
    have such good company as Gauguin's.</p>

    <p>I shall write again soon, and once more thanks for your kind
    letter.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>What do De Haan and Isa&auml;cson say about Monticelli? Have
    they seen other pictures of his than those in your house? You
    know that I myself still have the pretension to continue the
    job that Monticelli started here.</p>
