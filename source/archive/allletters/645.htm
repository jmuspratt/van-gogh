    <p>Letter 645<br>
     Auvers-sur-Oise, 28 June 1890</p>

     <p> Copy of a letter which I gave to Dr. Gachet.</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">You should send the enclosed order for paints at the
    beginning of the month, anyway at the most convenient time,
    there is no hurry, a few days sooner or later don't matter.</label></p>

    <p>Yesterday and the day before I painted <art id=0772>Mlle. Gachet's
    portrait</art>, which I hope you will see soon; the dress is pink,
    the wall in the background green with orange spots, the carpet
    red with green spots, the piano dark violet; it is 1 metre
    high by 50 cm wide.</p>

    <p>It is a figure that I painted with pleasure - but it is
    difficult.</p>

    <p>He has promised to make her pose for me another time
    at the small organ. I will do one for you - <label content="art.theory">I have noticed that
    this canvas goes very well with another <art id=0775>horizontal one of
    wheat</art>, as one canvas is vertical and in pink tones, the other
    pale green and greenish yellow, the complementary of pink; but
    we are still far from the time when people will understand the
    curious relation between one fragment of nature and another,
    which all the same explain each other and enhance each other.
    But some certainly feel it, and that's something.</label></p>

    <p>And then there is this improvement, that in clothes you see
    combinations of very pretty light colours; if you could make
    the people you are walking past pose and do their portraits, it
    would be as pretty as any period whatever in the past, and I
    even think that often in nature there is actually all the grace
    of a picture by Puvis, between art and nature. For instance,
    yesterday I saw two figures: the mother in a gown of deep
    carmine, the daughter in pale pink with a yellow hat without
    any ornament, very healthy country faces, browned by fresh air,
    burned by the sun; the mother especially had a very, very red
    face and black hair and two diamonds in her ears. And I thought
    again of that canvas by Delacroix,
    &ldquo;L'&Eacute;ducation Maternelle.&rdquo; For in the
    expression of the faces there was really everything that there
    was in the head of George Sand. Do you know that there is a
    portrait - &ldquo;Bust of George Sand&rdquo; - by Delacroix,
    there is a wood engraving of it in L'Illustration, with short
    hair.</p>

    <p>A good handshake in thought for you and Jo and good luck
    with the little one.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Editors Note: The original letter is missing; the text here
    is from a copy of the letter in Johanna's handwriting. The sketch
    Vincent drew of Mlle. Gachet at the piano, F 2049, is recorded,
    but its location (presumably with the rest of the original letter)
    is unknown. Jo's copy has just a blank rectangle in its place.]</p>
