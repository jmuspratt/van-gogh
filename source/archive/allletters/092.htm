  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter, be strong and He will strengthen
    your heart. Today I received a long letter from home, in which
    Father asked me if we could arrange to go together to Amsterdam
    next Sunday, to visit Uncle Cor. If you agree I will arrive at
    The Hague Saturday night at eleven o'clock, and we can go on to
    Amsterdam by the first train the next morning.</p>

    <p>I think we had better do so, Father seems to have set his
    heart upon it, and it will be nice to spend another Sunday
    together. Can I stay over night with you - otherwise I could go
    to a hotel. Write me a postcard if it is all right, let us keep
    close together.</p>

    <p>It is already late, this afternoon I took a long walk,
    because I felt I needed it, first around the Great Church, then
    past the New Church, and then along the dyke, where the mills
    are that one sees in the distance as one walks near the
    station. There is so much expressed in this peculiar landscape
    and surrounding, it seems to say: &ldquo;Be of good courage,
    fear not.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">Oh might I be shown the way to devote my life more
    completely to the service of God and the Gospel. I keep praying
    for it and I think I shall be heard, I say it in all humility.
    Humanly speaking, one would say it cannot happen, but when I
    think seriously about it and penetrate under the surface of
    what is impossible to man, then my soul is in communion with
    God, for it is possible to Him, who speaks and it is done; who
    commands and it stands fast.</label></p>

    <p>Oh! Theo, Theo boy, if I might only succeed in this, <label subject="psychology.depression">if that
    heavy depression because everything I undertook failed, that
    torrent of reproaches which I have heard and felt, </label>if it might
    be taken from me, and if there might be given to me both the
    opportunity and the strength needed to come to full development
    and to persevere in that course for which my father and I would
    thank the Lord so fervently.</p>

    <p>A handshake and kind regards to Roos,</p>

    <p>Ever your loving brother, Vincent</p>
