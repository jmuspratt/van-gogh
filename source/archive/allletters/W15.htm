    <p>Letter W15 <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Saint-R&eacute;my, c. 20-22 October 1889</p>

    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your last letter and for news it contained
    of Cor. One of these days you are going to move, and so this is
    the last time I shall write you at Breda.</p>

    <p>Within a very short time I shall send Theo the painted
    studies I promised you, and he will see to it that they are
    sent to you at Leyden.</p>

    <p>Here is what I have: <art id=0711>an orchard of olive trees</art>
    - a <art id=0619>field of wheat with a reaper</art> - <art id=0743>a
    field of wheat with cypresses</art> - <art id=0483>an interior</art>
    - <art id=0625>a ploughed field, early-morning effect</art>
    - orchard in bloom - and <art id=0525>a self-portrait</art>.</p>

    <p>Now suppose that I can send you as many during the next
    year, then they will make a little collection along with the
    two you have, and I should like you to keep them together if
    there is enough room, for I think that in Leyden you will meet
    artists from time to time, in which case other studies will
    join mine, I daresay. Don't be afraid to hang them in the
    passage, in the kitchen, on the staircase - above all, my
    paintings are meant to be seen against a simple background.</p>

    <p>I do my best to paint in such a way that my work will show
    up to good advantage in a kitchen, and then I may happen to
    discover that it shows up well in a parlour too, but this is
    something I never bother my head about. Here in the south we
    have bare walls, white or yellow, or covered with wallpaper
    with large coloured flowers. So it seems to me that it is a
    matter of using frank contrasts of colours. The same is true of
    the frames - the frames I use cost me five francs at the
    outside, whereas the gilt frames, which are less strong, would
    cost thirty or more. And if a picture shows to advantage in a
    simple frame, why put gilt around it?</p>

    <p>Now listen - if I am going to continue sending studies to
    you and Mother with great pleasure, I also feel a desire, which
    is almost an irresistible urge, to do some more of them to be
    given to persons I often think of. So if, since you will be in
    Leyden, you should meet our cousins the ladies Mauve and
    Lecomte, please tell them that, in case they like my work, I
    shall be pleased, very pleased, to do things for them, but most
    of all I should like Margot Begemann to have a picture of mine.
    But letting her have it through your mediation would seem more
    discreet than sending it to her directly. So you will greatly
    oblige me by taking measures for the three persons I have just
    mentioned to get some work of mine. There isn't any reason for
    hurry, but I certainly have a right, yes, a <i>right</i> to
    work from time to time for friends who are so far away that I
    shall probably never see them again.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">That physician here has been to Paris, and went to see Theo;
    he told him that he <i>did not</i> consider me a lunatic, but
    that the crises I have are of an epileptic nature</label>.<label content="food-and-drink.alcohol"> Consequently
    alcohol is also not the cause, though it must be understood
    that it does me no good either.</label> But it is difficult to return
    to one's ordinary way of life while one is too despondent over
    the uncertainty of misfortune. And one goes on clinging to the
    affections of the past.</p>

    <p>So, as I told you, I feel a nearly irresistible urge to send
    something of my work to Holland, and if you should succeed in
    getting people to accept anything, it will be <i>my</i> duty to
    be grateful.</p>

    <p>You will probably think the interior of the empty bedroom
    with a wooden bedstead and two chairs the most unbeautiful
    thing of all - and notwithstanding this <art id=0482>I have painted it
    twice</art>, <art id=0484>on a large scale.</art></p>

    <p>I wanted to achieve an effect of simplicity of the sort one
    finds described in Felix Holt. After being told this you may
    quickly understand this picture, but it will probably remain
    ridiculous in the eyes of others who have not been warned.
    Doing a simple thing with bright colours is not at all easy,
    and I for my part think it is perhaps useful to show that it is
    possible to be simple by using something other than grey,
    white, black or brown. Here you have the justification for the
    study's existence.</p>

    <p>You will think my wheat fields too yellow, but in our native
    country one should not begin by saying it is too yellow, too
    blue or too green.</p>

    <p>You will get the studies at Leyden - I don't know when. Theo
    will probably have one of them framed in Paris, so that you
    will be able to put them into a frame <i>if you should want
    to</i>, and then he will put them in a case to be sent to The
    Hague at the first opportunity. But what matters is that as far
    as my painting is concerned the work is finished, and I assure
    you that it is not the worst work I have done. I should like
    you to have <art id=0495>the red vine</art>, which Theo has in
    Paris, and if I should ever go back to Paris I shall copy it
    for you.</p>

    <p>Yes, I return once again to this interior. I certainly wish
    that other artists had a taste and a longing for simplicity as
    I do. But the ideal of simplicity renders life more difficult
    in modern society - and whoever has this ideal will not be able
    to do what he wants to in the end, as is the case with me. But
    so it is after all, yet this is what society should grant an
    artist in my opinion, whereas nowadays one is obliged to live
    in caf&eacute;s and low inns.</p>

    <p>The Japanese have always lived in very simple interiors, and
    what great artists have not lived in that country? If a painter
    is rich in our society, then he has to live in a house which is
    like a curiosity shop, and this isn't very artistic either to
    my taste. As for me, I often suffered under the fact that I had
    to live in conditions in which order was impossible, with the
    result that I lost the notion of order and simplicity.</p>

    <p>That good fellow Isa&auml;cson wants to write an
    article about me in one of the Dutch papers, on the subject of
    pictures which are <i>exactly</i> like those I am sending you,
    but reading such an article would make me very sad, and I wrote
    to tell him so.</p>

    <p>At present I am working at <art id=0646>a ward in the hospital. In the
    foreground a big black stove around which some grey and black
    forms of patients and then behind the very long ward paved in
    red with the two rows of white beds, the partitions white, but
    a lilac- or green-white, and the windows with pink curtains,
    with green curtains, and in the background two figures of nuns
    in black and white. The ceiling is violet with large beams</art>.
    I have read an article on Dostoevsky, who has
    written a book Souvenirs de la maison des morts [Memories of
    the house of the dead], and this has driven me to resume <art id=0646>a
    large study which I had [done, corrected to:] started in the
    fever ward in Arles.</art> But it is troublesome to do the figures
    without model.</p>

    <p>The other day I read another of Carmen Sylva's
    &ldquo;Thoughts,&rdquo; which is very true - when you suffer
    much, you see everybody at a great distance, and as at the far
    end of an immense arena - the very voices seem to come from
    afar. During the attacks I experience this to such a degree
    that all the persons I see then, <i>even if I recognize
    them</i>, which is not always the case, seem to come toward me
    out of a great distance, and to be <i>quite different</i> from
    what they are in reality, so much do I seem to see them in
    pleasant or unpleasant resemblances to person I knew in the
    past and elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Au revoir, I wish you the utmost success in your labour of
    moving, and I embrace you in thought.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
