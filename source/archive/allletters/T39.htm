    <p>Letter T39<br>
     Paris, 30 June 1890</p>

    <p>My dearest brother,</p>

    <p>We have gone through a period of the greatest anxiety; our
    dear little boy has been very ill, but fortunately the doctor,
    who was uneasy himself, told Jo, You are not going to lose the
    child because of this <sup>1</sup>. Here in Paris the best milk
    you can buy is downright poison. We are now giving him ass's
    milk, and this is doing him good, but you never heard anything
    so grievously distressing as this almost continuous plaintive
    crying all through many days and many nights, when you don't
    know what to do, and all you do seems to aggravate his
    sufferings. It's not that the milk isn't fresh, but what is
    wrong is the fodder and the treatment of the cows. It's
    abominable. You can well imagine how happy we are that it is
    going better. Jo was admirable, which you can imagine too. A
    true mother, but for all that she wore herself out a good deal
    too much; may she recover her strength and not be subjected to
    new trials. Fortunately she is asleep at the moment, but she is
    moaning in her sleep, and there is nothing I can do for her. If
    only the baby, who is sleeping too, will let her sleep for some
    hours, both them will wake up with a smile, at least I hope so.
    In general she is having a hard time of it at the moment.</p>

    <p>At present we do not know what we ought to do; there are
    problems. Ought we to take another apartment - you know, on the
    first floor of the same house? Ought we to go to Auvers, to
    Holland, or not? Ought I to live without a thought for the
    morrow, and when I work all day long not earn enough to protect
    that good Jo from worries over money matters, as those rats
    Boussod and Valadon are treating me as though I just entered
    their business, and are keeping me on a short allowance?
    Oughtn't I to be calculating, if I spend nothing on extras and
    am short of money - oughtn't I to tell them how matters stand,
    and if they should dare refuse me, oughtn't I to tell them at
    last, Gentlemen, I am going to take the plunge, and establish
    myself as a private dealer in my own house?</p>

    <p>While writing I think I came to the conclusion that this is
    my duty, and that if Mother, or Jo, or you or I myself should
    resign ourselves to starvation, it won't be of the slightest
    service to us - on the contrary. What would be the good of you
    and me going through the world like a pair of down-and-out
    beggars with nothing to eat? On the contrary, by keeping up our
    courage, and by living, all of us, sustained by our mutual love
    and mutual esteem, we shall make better headway, and we shall
    be able to fulfill our duty and our task with much greater
    security than if we were to weigh every mouthful of bread. What
    do you have to say to this, old fellow?</p>

    <p>Don't bother your head about me or about us, old fellow, but
    remember that what gives me the greatest pleasure is the
    knowledge that you are in good health and that you are busy
    with your work, which is admirable. You have too much ardor as
    it is, and we shall be ready for battle for a long time to come
    yet, for we shall have to battle all through life without
    eating the oats of charity they give to old horses in the
    mansions of the great. We shall draw the plow until our
    strength forsakes us, and we shall still look with admiration
    at the sun or the moon, according to the hour.</p>

    <p>We like this better than being put into an armchair and
    rubbing our legs like the old merchant at Auvers. Look here,
    old boy, watch your health as much as you can, and I shall do
    the same, for we have too much in our noodles to forget the
    daisies and the lumps of earth freshly cast up by the plough,
    neither do we forget the branches of the shrubs which put forth
    buds in spring, or the bare branches of the trees shivering in
    winter, nor the limpid blue of the serene skies, nor the big
    clouds of autumn, nor the uniformly grey sky in winter, nor the
    sun rising over our aunts' garden, nor the red sun going down
    into the sea at Scheveningen, nor the moon and stars of a fine
    night in summer or winter - no, come what may, this is our
    profession.</p>

    <p>Is this enough? No - I have, and I hope from the bottom of
    my heart that you too will someday have, - a wife to whom you
    will be able to say these things; and as for me - whose mouth
    is so often closed, and whose head is so often empty - it is
    from her that I receive the germs, which in all probability
    come from afar, but which were found by our beloved father and
    mother - perhaps they will grow so that at least I may become a
    man, and who knows whether my son, if he can stay alive and if
    I can help him - who knows whether he will not grow up to be
    Somebody. As for you, you have found your way, old fellow, your
    carriage is steady on its wheels and strong, and I am seeing my
    way, thanks to my dear wife. Take it easy, you, and hold your
    horses a little, so that there may be no accident, and as for
    me, an occasional lash of the whip would do me no harm.</p>

    <p>Your <art id=0772>portrait of Miss Gachet</art> must be admirable,
    and I shall be happy to see it with those spots of
    orange in the background. The sketch of the landscape makes me
    think of something exquisite. I am anxious to see it. That
    letter from father Peyron was good. After all, these people are
    of sterling quality. Now listen, as soon as Jo is a little
    stronger and the little one entirely recovered, you must come
    and stay with us for a day or two, at least on a Sunday and
    some days after. The Salons are closed, but it will not be much
    of a loss to you, for we shall go see the Quost together, and
    it is decidedly a fine picture. We are going to ask him if I
    can display it in the show window on the Boulevard, at least if
    it's not too large. But it must be possible, and there will
    also be one of your things, old fellow. It is only fair that
    the two of you should be together, for it was you who drew my
    attention to that beautiful picture of Quost's. Do you know
    that I sold that fine picture by Corot, and that those duffers
    Boussod and Valadon said it could not be sold? Well, Tersteeg
    sold it to Mesdag at a profit of 5000 and Mesdag is so pleased
    with it that he wants to buy other ones like it, and he has
    written to Arnold &amp; Trip asking them to look out for
    similar pieces.</p>

    <p>Good-by, dear old brother, the paints are going off. I shake
    your hand most cordially, and I am glad that the little one and
    his mummy are sleeping soundly.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
