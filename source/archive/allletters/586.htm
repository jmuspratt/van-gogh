  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have seen M. Salles again, and he said that he has written
    to you. I think that this will be for the best, and I see no
    other way.<label content="health.mental"> The power of thought is coming back to me gradually,
    but I am much less able to manage practical things than hitherto.</p>

    <p>I am absent-minded and could not direct my own life just now.</label></p>

    <p>But let's leave that alone as much as possible. How are things going, are you back?</p>

    <p>I must tell you that I think you may find M. Salles' letter still addressed to Rue Lepic.</p>

    <p>How are things at home? I think Mother must have been pleased.</p>

    <p>I assure you that I am much calmer now that I can tell
    myself that you have a companion for good. Above all, do not
    imagine that I am unhappy.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I feel deeply that this has been at work within me for a
    very long time already, and that other people, seeing symptoms
    of mental derangement, have naturally had apprehensions better
    founded than my unfounded certainty that I was thinking
    normally, which was not the case.</label><label content="attitude.people"> So that has much softened
    many of the judgements which I have too often passed with more
    or less presumption on people who nevertheless were wishing me
    well. Anyhow, it is certainly a pity that with me these
    reflections reach the <i>stage of feeling</i> rather late.</label></p>

    <p>But I want you to think all that over and to consider the
    step we are taking now, just as I spoke of it to M. Salles,
    this going into an asylum, as purely a formality, and in any
    case the repeated attacks seem to me to have been serious
    enough to leave no room for hesitation.</p>

    <p>Besides, as to my future, it is not as if I were twenty,
    since I have turned thirty-six.</p>

    <p>Really, I think it would be torture for other people as well
    as for myself if I were to leave the hospital, for I feel and
    am, as it were, paralyzed when it comes to acting and shifting
    for myself. Later on - well, let's wait and see.</p>

    <p>I should like to ask you loads of things about Holland and
    about these days. Poor egoist that I have always been and still
    am, I can't get the idea out of my head, although I have
    already explained it to you two or three times, that it is
    really for the best if I go into an asylum immediately. Things
    may come out right perhaps in the long run. Anyway, my very
    poor excuse is that painting narrows your ideas about other
    things, perhaps you cannot be doing your work and think of
    other things at the same time. It's hard enough, come to think
    of it, for the job is pretty thankless and its usefulness is
    certainly questionable.<label content="business.co-op"> There remains, however, the idea of an
    association of painters, of lodging them in common, some of
    them; though we did not succeed, though it is a deplorable and
    melancholy failure, the idea is still true and reasonable, like
    so may others. But we won't begin again.</label></p>

    <p>Understand clearly that we must get absolutely the simplest
    board and lodging, 80 francs ought to be enough and can be, M.
    Salles says. Rey warns me about St. R&eacute;my that it
    is as well to remember that a good many of the patients are
    fairly well off and some of them spend a lot of money. Which
    often does them more harm than good. I can well believe it.</p>

    <p>And I think that in my case nature by herself will do much
    more for me than any remedies. Here I take <i>nothing</i>. I
    may still have to pay 11.87 fr. in installment for the
    furniture - at least they sent me a bill for it - besides the
    rest of the rent which I still owe the landlord. And I must
    send you my collection of pictures before going to St.
    R&eacute;my. I have one case already packed.</p>

    <p>I would like to write you about something else, but my mind
    is taken up with arranging this business, and I can't find the
    ideas I am seeking, so as to write you about several things at
    once.</p>

    <p>Goodbye for now. I hope you and your wife have had a good
    journey.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
