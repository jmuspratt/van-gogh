  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I received your letter, and want to thank you very much for
    it. How eager I am sometimes to see something of your work. As
    regards &ldquo;Arti,&rdquo; I think that these gentlemen are up
    to their usual tricks again - one of those things that won't
    change, which used to be and will always be what they are now.
    I congratulate you on their refusal. I cannot tell you anything
    about a similar experience of my own, for the simple reason
    that I don't even dream of exhibiting my work. The idea leaves
    me absolutely cold. Now and then I wish some friend could have
    a look at what I have in my studio - which happens very seldom;
    but I have never felt the wish and I think I never shall - to
    invite the general public to look at my work. I am not
    indifferent to appreciation of my work, but this too must be
    something silent - and I think a certain popularity the least
    desirable thing of all.</p>

    <p>A short while ago I collected all the studies I have done
    since the time of your visit or thereabouts. I found about a
    hundred figure drawings of men, women and children, not
    counting what I have drawn in my sketchbook. Although the
    number does not matter so much, I just mention it to show you
    that I am trying to push on energetically, and yet I am looked
    down upon, and considered a nonentity, by fellows who are
    certainly working less hard than I am - which by the way leaves
    me pretty cold - and nobody here pays the slightest attention
    to my work.</p>

    <p>And from this you will see that, though what is happening to
    me is not exactly the same as your experience, it is after all
    tweedledum and tweedledee.</p>

    <p>On the other hand I am of the opinion that whoever wants to
    do figures must first have what is printed on the Christmas
    number of Punch: &ldquo;Good Will to All&rdquo; - and this to a
    high degree. One must have a warm sympathy with human beings,
    and go on having it, or the drawings will remain cold and
    insipid. I consider it very necessary for us to watch
    ourselves, and to take care that we do not become disenchanted
    in this respect, and I therefore think it of little importance
    to meddle in what I will call &ldquo;painters' intrigues&rdquo;
    and to assume any attitude toward them other than defensive. I
    always think of the old proverb, &ldquo;One does not gather
    figs from thorns,&rdquo; as soon as I realize that some people
    believe they will be stimulated by their intercourse with
    artists. I believe Thomas a Kempis says somewhere, &ldquo;I
    never mingled with human beings without feeling less
    human.&rdquo; In the same way I think one feels weaker as an
    artist (and rightly too) the more one associates with artists.
    Only when artists seriously combine to cooperate on a task that
    is too much for only one man (for instance Erckmann-Chatrian in
    their works - or the artists of the <i>Graphic for</i> the
    <i>Graphic</i>) do I think it an excellent thing. But in most
    cases it turns out to be much ado about nothing.</p>

    <p>If I said just now that at times I wish I could see your
    work, on the other hand I often wish you could see mine too.
    The reason is that I think I could profit by your opinion, and
    also that you would see that the separate drawings are
    gradually beginning to form a whole, and also that we might
    talk things over and try to find a way of making some money out
    of them.</p>

    <p>Not without some trouble I have at last discovered how the
    miners' wives in the Borinage carry their sacks. You may
    remember that when I was there I did some drawings of it - but
    they were not yet the real thing [F 994, JH 253]. Now I have
    made 12 studies of the same subject.</p>

    <p><?showImage("273_V-R_R160");?>
    </p>

    <p>Look, the opening of the sack is tied up and hangs down. The
    points at the bottom are joined together, and in this way you
    get a very funny-looking sort of monk's hood. (At the points I
    and 2 the hands grasp it.) I often made a woman with such a
    sack pose for me, but it never turned out right. Now a man who
    was loading coal at the Rhine railway junction has shown
    me.</p>

    <p>This week I came across a volume of Punch for 1855 and also
    one for 1862. In the former there is a cartoon by old Swains
    which is indescribably noble in character. The Czar of Russia
    of that time had, I think, in a &ldquo;speech from the
    throne&rdquo; referring to the Crimean War that was then going
    on, declared that Russia had two generals on whom she could
    depend, namely the winter months January and February. Now it
    happened that in the month of February of that same year his
    Majesty the Emperor fell ill, having caught a cold, and
    died.</p>

    <p>Now you see in this cartoon, probably drawn by Tenniel, the
    old emperor on his deathbed, and General February turned a
    traitor is standing near this deathbed - in the shape of a
    skeleton dressed in general's uniform; the deathbed as well as
    the phantom near it are covered with snow and glazed frost. It
    is glorious, and, if such a thing is possible, I think its
    sentiment even more profound and serious than that of Holbein's
    &ldquo;Death Dance.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>C. R. [Robinson], whose beautiful cartoon I sent you, is
    rather uneven in his work, by which I mean that his figures,
    though they are always well drawn, do not always move one. But
    now I have found another cartoon that is nearly as beautiful as
    Caldecott's &ldquo;Afternoon in Kings Road&rdquo; - a long row
    of figures looking over a low fence at a collapsed bridge.</p>

    <p>Do you have the Dagnan and the Montbard about which I wrote
    you - &ldquo;Charmeur au Jardin des Tuileries&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;Arab Beggars&rdquo; - you know they are at your
    disposal. I have found another beautiful sheet by Emslie,
    &ldquo;The Rising of the Waters,&rdquo; a peasant woman with
    two children on a half-flooded meadow with pollard willows.</p>

    <p>I assure you, every time I feel a little out of sorts, I
    find in my collection of wood engravings a stimulus to set to
    work with renewed zest. In all these fellows I see an energy, a
    determination and a free, healthy, cheerful spirit that animate
    me. And in their work there is something lofty and dignified -
    even when they draw a dunghill. When you read in that book
    about Gavarni, with reference to his drawings, that &ldquo;il
    sabra jusqu'&agrave; 6 par jour&rdquo; [he dispatched up to six a
    day], and you think of the enormous productivity of most of
    those men who make these &ldquo;little illustrations&rdquo; -
    &ldquo;those things you find on the reading table of the South
    Holland Cafe,&rdquo; you know - you can't help thinking that
    there must be an extraordinary amount of ardour and fire in
    them. And I think, having this fire within oneself and stirring
    it up continually is better than having the arrogance of those
    artists who disdain looking at it. I think that bit of
    reasoning of your friend, or rather your critically critical
    (how can one express it?) visitor, about the
    &ldquo;<i>impermissible</i> line&rdquo; highly curious and
    characteristic. Will you be so kind as to convey to him<i>,</i>
    at the first opportunity, my profound respect for his wisdom
    and competence, although I have neither the privilege nor the
    pleasure of knowing his Honor, for I am not wholly unacquainted
    with men of that ilk, and so&hellip;</p>

    <p>Just ask your friend of the impermissible line whether he
    wants to object to the
    &ldquo;B&eacute;n&eacute;dicit&eacute;&rdquo; by De Groux or
    the &ldquo;Last Supper&rdquo; by Leonardo da Vinci - in which
    compositions the heads are also placed in a nearly straight
    line.</p>

    <p>Do you know &ldquo;Midsummer Night's Dream&rdquo; by Harry
    Furniss, showing some people - an old man, a street urchin, a
    drunk - spending the night on a bench under a chestnut tree in
    the park? This sheet is as beautiful as the most beautiful
    Daumier.</p>

    <p>Don't you think Andersen's Fairy Tales are glorious? - he is
    surely an illustrator too!</p>
