  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Is your health still improving? I am eager for news from
    you. The other day I bought twenty-one volumes of the
    Graphic<i>,</i> namely 1870-1880. What do you think of that? I
    hope to receive them this week. I got them very cheap, you
    understand, or else I couldn't have afforded it. But I heard
    that they were for sale, and I strongly recommended them to
    someone who is also interested in them.</p>

    <p>I have been working hard since your illness on
    black-and-white drawings, and I hope to learn a few more things
    about the forces of black and white from these <i>Graphics.</i>
    I wish we could have a talk again, for, my dear fellow, there
    is such a lot to do!</p>

    <p>What I have been working at especially of late is <i>heads -
    heads of the people</i> <sup>1</sup> <i>-</i> fishermen's heads
    with sou'westers, among other things.</p>

    <p>As soon as I have looked through the Graphics<i>,</i> I
    shall write you again, and then in more detail. Of course I
    shall get a lot of duplicates in this way.</p>

    <p>Now you will oblige me greatly by giving me more particulars
    about the lot you bought - I mean not only by telling me
    whether there are duplicates, but also what interesting prints
    you have found in general.</p>

    <p>I have found a &ldquo;Head of a Little Girl&rdquo; by Percy
    Macquoid which is splendid; it is a wood engraving <i>after a
    picture</i> of his. Other beautiful sheets that I have found
    are, to mention only some of them:</p>

    <p>I did not get these Graphics without trouble. For instance,
    the Jew I bought them from forced me to do two portraits of his
    father and mother (i.e. two of each!)</p>

    <p>But isn't it a lucky find!</p>

    <p>But it's so funny that they're already my property and that
    I haven't even seen them. The fact is that they are stored in
    an auction room together with a big lot of books, but the Jew
    will get them out this week.</p>

    <p>Among the books there is Gavarni's La Mascarade Humaine,
    which I have, but what about you? And the Jew has a lot of
    other things besides, some of them probably good.</p>

    <p>Well, more soon; I hope your recovery is progressing
    steadily - in haste!</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
