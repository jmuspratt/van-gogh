    <p>Letter T12<br>
     Paris, 16 July 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">I have been absolutely unable to write you sooner, for the
    heat has been overwhelming, and I felt so weak that everything
    made me feel extremely tired. Now I have almost recovered from
    it - for good, I hope.</label> I thank you for your letters and the
    fine drawings you sent me. <art id=1467>The hospital at Arles is very
    remarkable</art>, <art id=1523>the butterfly</art> and the branch of the eglantine are
    very beautiful too; simple in colour and very beautifully drawn. The last drawings give
    the impression of having been made in a fury, and are a bit
    removed from nature. I shall understand them better when I have
    seen one of these subjects in painting. I have invited quite a
    number of people to see your pictures, the Pissarros, Father
    Tangui,<sup>1</sup> Verenskiold, a Norwegian who has a lot of
    talent and who got the medal of honour in his country's section
    at the Universal Exhibition at Maus's.</p>

    <p>The latter is the secretary of the &ldquo;XX&rdquo; at
    Brussels. He came to ask me whether you would be willing to
    send in work for their next exhibition. There is plenty of time
    for it, but he didn't know whether he could come to Paris
    before the event. I told him that I did not suppose you would
    have any objections. He ought to invite Bernard too. In general
    people like <art id=0474>the night effect</art> and <art id=0456>the</art>
    <art id=0454>sunflowers</art>. I have put <art id=0458>one of the sunflower pieces</art> in our
    dining room against the mantelpiece. It has the effect of a
    piece of cloth with satin and gold embroidery; it is
    magnificent.</p>

    <p>As from the 15th onward I no longer have the apartment in
    the Rue Lepic at my disposal, and as it is impossible to store
    all the canvases at home, I have rented a little room in Father
    Tangui's house, where I have put quite a few of them. I have
    chosen those which are to be taken from the stretchers, and
    then other canvases can be put on them. Father Tangui has been
    very helpful, and it will be easy to let him have new things
    all the time, which he will be able to show. You can well
    imagine how enthusiastic he is about the things with expressive
    colours, like the vines, the night effect, etc. I wish you
    could hear him, if only once. I also forgot to tell you that De
    Haan has been here; he sent Jo an enormous bunch of poppies of
    all sorts of colours; I never saw such a glorious bouquet and
    the rain of multicoloured petals when they began to wither! He
    likes what you do very much. He is now with Gauguin.
    Isa&auml;cson is all at sea now that De Haan is no
    longer here. Gauguin is writing for a paper, which I am sending
    you; he wrote me a letter last week, and asked me to let him
    have your address, as he had lost it; De Haan told me that
    Gauguin has done very fine things. You were not very fortunate
    in not seeing Mr. Salles, or Rey, when you went to Arles.
    <sup>2</sup> I had a letter from the former gentleman. Before I
    received our letter in which you told me to send him the
    &ldquo;Wanderers to Ammaus,&rdquo; I sent him
    &ldquo;Angelus,&rdquo; a lithograph by Vernier. I am sorry I
    did not think of the other subject, for it would have been
    rather more to his taste.</p>

    <p>You can well imagine that the news of Jo's pregnancy excited
    her parents greatly. Her father and mother are coming here next
    week. Our mother too is very pleased.</p>

    <p>What you say is very true - that her letter is very
    remarkable for her age. Yes, it certainly is a very good thing
    that I am married, for if this had not been the case I think I
    should have been a very sick man at present, whereas now I
    believe I am getting my strength back, and will be able to work
    a little better than I have.</p>

    <p>Jo is very good to me, and yet she has had her very bad days
    in consequence of vomiting, etc.; now she seems to be calming
    down, and she is looking well. If only the child is viable. I
    think that in general children inherit the parents' kind of
    constitution rather than the state of their health at the
    moment of begetting.</p>

    <p>I have to close this letter in a hurry. Enclosed is a money
    order, for since you did not see Mr. Salles, it is possible
    that you need something.</p>

    <p>Best wishes, also from Jo, and once again many thanks for
    your kind letters and the drawings.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>

        <p>Theo invariably wrote Tangui, and not Tanguy like
        Vincent.</p>
