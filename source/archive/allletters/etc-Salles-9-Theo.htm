  <body>
    <p>Arles, June 5th 1889</p>

    <p>Dear Sir,</p>
    <p>An absence that I have just taken has prevented me from answering you letter of
    the 22nd last, and of carrying out your commission for the treasurer of the
    hospice any earlier.</p>

    <p>I am happy to hear the news that you gave me of your brother. I really wanted to hear
    about him.</p>

    <p>I hope that one day or another he will write to me to give me news of himself directly.</p>

    <p>I paid the treasurer the balance that was due to him (20.45 f.) for your brother's
    keep, but I didn't find it necessary to give anything to the nurses who care for him.</p>

    <p>I have received from you in total 100 f. (50 f. from the 200 sent at the time of the
    departure for St-R&eacute;my, and the 50 f. in your last letter).</p>

    <p>There I only spent 7 f. for your brother's journey and mine to St-R&eacute;my and the
    20 f. 45 for the here-included bill; in all 27 f. 45. I have therefore 72.55 of yours left.</p>

    <p>I wondered if I should send you this sum or keep it in the event that your brother (as he
    said to me) needs me to send him something from here. I would welcome your instructions on this.</p>

    <p>I am writing this word in a hurry, and ask you, my dear Sir, to accept my
    very cordial greetings.</p>

    <p>Salles.</p>
