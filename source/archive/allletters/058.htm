    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Just one word more, probably the last I shall write from
    Paris. I leave here on Friday night and shall be home Saturday
    morning at the same time as at Christmas.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I saw six pictures by Michel, how I wish you could
    have seen them too! Sunken paths through sandy fields leading
    to a mill, or a man going home across the heath with grey skies
    above - so simple and beautiful. I think the &ldquo;Men of
    Emmaus&rdquo; saw nature in the same way as Michel and I always
    think of them when I see one of his pictures.</p>

    <p>At the same time I saw a very large picture by Jules
    Dupr&eacute;. There is black marshy soil as far as one can see,
    on the second plane is a river, and in the foreground, a pool
    with three horses. Both the river and the pool reflect a bank
    of white and grey clouds, behind which the sun has set. The sky
    is a soft blue, with some grey-red and purple at the
    horizon.</p>

    <p>I saw these pictures at Durand Ruel's; more than twenty-five
    etchings after Millet, the same number after Michel and a great
    number after Dupr&eacute; and Corot. All the other artists can
    be purchased there at 1 franc apiece; it was tempting. I could
    not resist the Millet and bought the last three that were to be
    had after &ldquo;The Angelus&rdquo;; of course, my brother will
    get one of them at the first opportunity.</p>

    <p>Write again soon, kind regards to Roos, and Mr. and Mrs.
    Tersteeg and all who may ask after me. A handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
