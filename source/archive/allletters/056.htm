  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter. Please thank Mauve and his wife for
    theirs also; I enjoyed it very much. I am longing to see the
    two pictures by Mauve that are destined for the Salon.</p>

    <p>Perhaps Gladwell will come back to his old room; he is to
    have my place at the gallery.</p>

    <p>Are you having gales at The Hague like the ones we are
    having here? Do you know that I will first go to Etten, save
    for something unforeseen? I think I will leave the
    1<sup>st</sup> April, perhaps even the 31<sup>st</sup>
    March.</p>

    <p>Our parents have written me that you also intend to come to
    Etten. When do you leave?</p>

    <p>I hope to have the opportunity to send you the Longfellow
    before your departure; it is perhaps a good book for a
    journey.</p>

    <p>My hour approaches: just three more weeks. Now and then I
    have to remind myself, &ldquo;Be patient and meek.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Aunt Cornelie has lent me a beautiful book: Kenelm
    Chillingly by Bulwer-Lytton. It is full of beauty inside. The
    subject? The son of a rich Englishman who does not find
    anywhere rest and peace in his life and he tried to find it
    among the lower classes. He will end up nevertheless by
    returning home, without regretting anything that he has
    done.</p>

    <p>And now &agrave; Dieu, a pleasant journey (enjoy yourself
    and see many beautiful things) if you leave before my next
    letter. Always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
  </body>
