    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Don't be angry with me for arriving out of the blue. I've
    given it so much thought and I'm sure we'll gain time this way.
    Shall be at the Louvre from midday onwards, or earlier if you
    like.</p>

    <p>Please let me know what time you can get to the Salle
    Carr&eacute;e. As far as expenses are concerned, I repeat that
    it won't make much difference. I still have some money left, of
    course, and I want to talk to you before spending any of it.
    We'll sort everything out, you'll see.</p>

    <p>So come as soon as you can. I shake your hand,</p>

    <p><?showImage("552_V-T_4590");?>
     Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Vincent had arrived unexpectedly in Paris from Antwerp,
    scribbled this note in French with a piece of black crayon at
    the station and sent it to Theo by a porter. Theo had wanted
    him to wait till June, when he could rent a larger apartment.
    He stayed with Theo in the Rue de Laval, and moved with him in
    June to the Rue Lepic, in Montmartre.]</p>
