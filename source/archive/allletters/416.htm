  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for the money, your letter and the Raffaelli
    catalogue. I think the drawings in it masterly. What he himself
    says further about &ldquo;le charact&eacute;ristique&rdquo; is
    interesting.</p>

    <p>His article is a mixture of very simple words that come from
    the heart and from a nervous artistic temperament; these are
    striking. And besides - of words which, I think, Raffaelli
    himself understands as little as those who must read them. So
    it is an article full of very fine things and full of mistakes.
    That's what I like to read more than anything else. For what he
    talks about is so intensely complicated after all.</p>

    <p>Yet the substance of what he says is satisfactory in the
    reading, and with all his queer sallies he says something that
    is healthy and true.</p>

    <p>Theo, you must not think that if I saw Uhde's picture myself
    I should lose the impression I got from it. I repeat, I think
    it will be the same with this man as with Knaus and Labrichon.
    After a few things of character, it is the very technique that
    will be his undoing, that is to say, he will become more and
    more correct in his work and more and more dry.</p>

    <p>In my opinion as a painter Raffaelli ranks much higher than
    Uhde.</p>

    <p>You never hear me being pessimistic about Lhermitte, do you?
    So I am not a man who always doubts. On the contrary, I have a
    very strong confidence in some people.</p>

    <p>I had never seen anything of Raffaelli's except those two
    blacksmiths; I wrote you about it at the time.</p>

    <p>Raffaelli and especially Lhermitte possess what Raffaelli
    calls &ldquo;conscience.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I am afraid that this will be Uhde's weak point, that he
    will no longer know his own mind.</p>

    <p>So much for that. You say that the silvery grey Uhde uses is
    so beautiful and that if I saw the picture I should think
    differently of it.</p>

    <p>No, boy - I have seen so much grey in my life that such a
    bit of silver-grey cannot seduce me so easily as it used
    to.</p>

    <p>Painting grey as a <i>system</i> is becoming intolerable,
    and we shall certainly get to see the other side of the
    coin.</p>

    <p>Yet in order to convince you that I want to appreciate its
    good qualities, and have nothing against it, I am just now
    working on a grey picture. We can't help discussing these
    things further someday. Don't forget, however, that though I
    have some objections to Uhde, I admit that I certainly admire
    the main part of <i>this</i> picture, which forms
    three-quarters of it - the children.</p>

    <p><label content="health.fatigue">I must go out and work - I didn't want to put off writing
    any longer; I am dog-tired every day because I have to go far,
    far across the heath!</label></p>

    <p>I have also done some more figures.</p>

    <p>I am very sorry to hear what you said about the money, that
    you will be very hard up yourself.</p>

    <p>Painting is sometimes so damned expensive, and especially
    nowadays, it is so necessary to follow one's own idea,
    co&ucirc;te que co&ucirc;te.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Il nous faut un art de force vive&rdquo; [What we
    want is an art with live vigour], Raffaelli says, and in order
    to reach that aim in figure drawing, it costs a lot of trouble
    to find models.</p>

    <p>The time has past - and I don't want it back - when it was
    enough for a figure to be academically, conventionally correct,
    or rather, though many still ask for this, a reaction is
    setting in - and I hope it will make some stir. The artists
    call for character, well - the public will do the same.</p>

    <p>I assure you that Uhde's Christ is a <i>sad</i> failure
    indeed, it is definitely below the mark - the children are
    good.</p>

    <p>I like Lhermitte and Raffaelli so much because their work is
    so thoroughly logical, sensible and honest!</p>

    <p>I have here before me some figures: a woman with a spade,
    seen from behind; another bending to glean the ears of corn;
    another seen from the front, her head almost on the ground,
    digging carrots. I have been watching those peasant figures
    here for more than a year and a half, especially their action,
    just to catch their character. Therefore I cannot stand such a
    Santa Claus as Uhde painted in that little school - the little
    school in itself is very beautiful though. Uhde himself - oh, I
    am sure that he knows it quite well, and that he has only done
    so because the honest people in his country want a
    &ldquo;sujet&rdquo; and &ldquo;something (conventional) to make
    them think,&rdquo; as otherwise he would have to starve. One of
    these days, if I can find a moment when I am not too tired to
    write, I shall try to tell you once again how splendid I find
    some things in Raffaelli. Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
