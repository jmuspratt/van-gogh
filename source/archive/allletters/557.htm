    <p>Letter 557<br>
     Arles, 24 October 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and the 50-fr. note. As you learned
    from my wire, Gauguin has arrived in good health. He gives me the
    impression he is even better than me.</p>

    <p>Naturally he is very pleased with the sale you have
    effected, and I no less, since in this way certain expenses
    absolutely necessary for the installation need not wait, and
    will not weigh wholly on your shoulders. G. will certainly
    write you today. He is very, very interesting as a man, and I have
    every confidence that we shall do loads of things with him. He
    will probably produce a great deal here, and I hope perhaps I
    shall too.</p>

    <p>And then I dare hope that the burden will be a <i>little</i>
    less heavy for you, and I even hope, <i>much</i> less heavy.</p>

    <p>I myself realize the necessity to produce even to the extent of
    being morally crushed and physically drained by it, just
    because after all I have no other means of ever getting back
    what we have spent.</p>

    <p>I cannot help it that my pictures do not sell.</p>

    <p>The day will come when people will see that
    they are worth more than the price of the paint and my own
    living, very meager after all, that is put into them.</p>

    <p>I have no other desire nor any other interest as to money or
    finance, than primarily to have no debts.</p>

    <p>But my dear boy, my debt is so great that when I have paid
    it, when all the same I hope to succeed in doing, the pains of
    producing pictures will have taken my whole life from me, and
    it will seem to me then that I have not lived. The only thing
    is that perhaps the production of the pictures will become a
    little more difficult for me, and as to numbers, there will not
    always be so many.</p>

    <p>It is agonizing to me that there is no demand for them now,
    because you suffer for it, but as far as I am concerned - if
    only you were not too worried by my bringing nothing in - it
    would pretty much be all the same to me.</p>

    <p>But in money matters it is enough for me to realize this
    truth - that a man who lives for 50 years and spends 2000 a
    year has spent 100,000 francs, and must bring in 100,000 francs
    again. To do 1000 pictures at 100 francs during one's life as
    an artist comes very, very, very hard, but even when the
    picture is at 100 francs . . . once again . . . at times our
    task is very heavy. But there is no changing that.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">We shall probably bypass Tasset altogether, because to a
    large extent we are going to use cheaper colours, Gauguin as
    well as I. And in the same way we are going to prepare the
    canvas ourselves.</label><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition"> For a while I had a
    feeling that I was going to be ill, but Gauguin's arrival has so taken my mind off it
    that I'm sure it will pass. I must not neglect my food for a
    time, and that is all, absolutely all there is to it.</label></p>

    <p>And after a time you will have some work again.</p>

    <p>Gauguin brought a magnificent canvas, which he has exchanged
    with Bernard,<art id=retonnes> Breton women in a green field, white, black,
    green, and a note of red, and the dull flesh tints. After all,
    we must all be of good cheer.</art></p>

    <p>I believe that the time will come when I too shall sell, but
    I am so far behind with you, and while I go on spending, I
    bring nothing in. Sometimes the thought of it saddens me.</p>

    <p>I am very glad of what you write, that one of the Dutchmen
    is coming to stay with you, so that you will not be alone any
    more, and it's all right, absolutely all right, especially
    since the winter will soon be here.</p>

    <p>And now I am in a hurry and must go out and set to work
    again on another size 30 canvas.</p>

    <p>Very soon, when Gauguin writes, I'll add another letter to
    his. Naturally, I don't know beforehand what Gauguin will say
    of this country, and of our life, but in any case he is very
    pleased with the good sale you have managed for him.</p>

    <p>Goodbye for now, and a good handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
