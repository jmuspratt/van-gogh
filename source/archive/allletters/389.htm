    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Enclosed you will find a few scratches of the heads I am
    working on; I scratched them in a hurry, and from memory.</p>

    <p>I told you how little money was left for this month; you
    know how last month it was about the same.</p>

    <p>The fact is that now more than ever, I paint as long as I
    have money for models.</p>

    <p>Those last days of the month when I sometimes <i>must
    stop</i> working on things I want to finish - I can't tell you
    how impatient and wretched it makes me.</p>

    <p>I must make about 50 of those heads while I am still here,
    and while I can get, relatively easily, all kinds of models
    during the winter months. But now - if I don't take care, the
    winter months will pass without my making as many as I want and
    as are necessary.</p>

    <p>That's the reason why I am harping on it so much, and must
    urge you most strongly to try, if only half possible, to cover
    my expenses of the end of this month.</p>

    <p>I do not need much, 20 or 30 francs will pretty well see me
    through.</p>

    <p>At the moment they are worth more to me than 50 francs
    <i>later on</i>.</p>

    <p>By working on steadily, those fifty heads will be finished
    this winter. But they require so much work and drudgery that I
    can't spare a day.</p>

    <p>And I hope it will be a means to making an arrangement
    between you and me which is better for both parties than the
    present one.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, if you have borrowed or can borrow, help me with
    it. As I didn't want to have all my colour bills at the end of
    the year, I have already paid part of them this month, as I
    told you. But I cannot bear to have the work suffer for it.</p>

    <p>I received from Rappard a series of drawings by Renouard,
    &ldquo;Le Monde Judiciare,&rdquo; types of lawyers, criminals,
    etc.</p>

    <p>I do not know if you have noticed them, I like them very
    much. And I think he is one of the genuine race of the Daumiers
    and the Gavarnis.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
