    <p>Letter 615<br>
     Saint-R&eacute;my, c. 21 November 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">I have to thank you very much for a package of paints, which
    was accompanied by an excellent woolen waistcoat.</label></p>

    <p>How kind you are to me, and how I wish I could do something
    good, so as to prove to you that I would like to be less
    ungrateful. The paints reached me at the right moment, because
    what I had brought back from Arles was almost exhausted. The
    thing is that this month I have been working in the olive
    groves, because their Christs in the Garden, with nothing
    really observed, have gotten on my nerves. Of course with me
    there is no question of doing anything from the Bible - and I
    have written to Bernard and Gauguin too that I considered that
    our duty is thinking, not dreaming, so that when looking at
    their work I was astonished at their letting themselves go like
    that. For Bernard has sent me photos of his canvases. The
    trouble with them is that they are a sort of dream or nightmare
    - that they are erudite enough - you can see that it is someone
    who is gone on the primitives - but frankly the English
    Pre-Raphaelites did it much better, and then again Puvis and
    Delacroix, much more healthily than the Pre-Raphaelites.</p>

    <p>It is not that it leaves me cold, but it gives me a painful
    feeling of collapse instead of progress. Well, to shake that
    off, morning and evening these bright cold days, but with a
    very fine, clear sun, I have been <art id=0587>knocking about</art> in <art id=0586>the
    orchards</art>, and <art id=0708>the result</art> is <art id=0710>five</art> size<art id=0707> 30
    canvases</art>, which along with the three studies of olives that you have, at least
    constitute an attack on the problem. The olive is as variable
    as our willow or pollard willow in the North, you know the
    willows are very striking, in spite of their seeming
    monotonous, they are the trees characteristic of the country.
    Now the olive and the cypress have exactly the significance
    here as the willow has at home. What I have done is a rather
    hard and coarse reality beside their abstractions, but it will
    have a rustic quality, and will smell of the earth. I should so
    like to see Gauguin's and Bernard's studies from nature, the
    latter talks to me of portraits - which doubtless would please
    me better.</p>

    <p>I hope to get myself used to working in the cold - in the
    morning there are very interesting effects of white frost and
    fog; then I still have a great desire to do for the mountains
    and cypresses what I have just done for the olives, and have a
    good go at them.</p>

    <p>The thing is that these have rarely been painted, the olive
    and the cypress, and from the point of view of disposing of the
    pictures, they <i>ought</i> to go in England. I know well
    enough what they look for there. However that may be, I am
    almost sure that in this way I'll do something tolerable from
    time to time. It is really my opinion more and more, as I said
    to Isa&auml;cson, if you work diligently from nature
    without saying to yourself beforehand - &ldquo;I want to do
    this or that,&rdquo; if you work as if you were making a pair
    of shoes, without artistic preoccupations, you will not always
    do well, but the days you least expect it, you find a subject
    which holds its own with the work of those who have gone
    before. You learn to know a country which is basically quite
    different from what it appears at first sight.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, you say to yourself - &ldquo;I want to
    finish my pictures better, I want to do them with care,&rdquo;
    lots of ideas like that, when one is confronted by the
    difficulties of weather and of changing effects, are reduced to
    impracticability, and finally I resign myself and say, It is
    the experience and the poor work <i>of every day</i> which
    alone will ripen in the long run and allow one to do something
    truer and more complete. So slow, long work is the only way,
    and all ambition and keenness to make a good thing of it,
    false. For you must spoil quite as many canvases, when you
    return to the charge every morning, as you succeed with. To
    paint, a regular tranquil existence would be absolutely
    necessary, and at the present time, what can you do, when you
    see that Bernard for instance is hurried, always hurried by his
    parents? He cannot do as he wishes, and many others are in the
    same fix.</p>

    <p>Tell yourself, I will not paint any more, but then what is
    one to do? Oh, we must invent a more expeditious method of
    painting, less expensive than oil, and yet lasting. A
    picture&hellip;that will end by becoming as commonplace as a
    sermon, and a painter will be like a creature left over from
    the last century. All the same, it is a pity it should be this
    way. Now if the painters had understood Millet better as a man,
    as some, e.g. Lhermitte and Roll, have now grasped him, things
    would not be like this. We must work as much and with as few
    pretensions as a peasant if we want to last.</p>

    <p>And instead of grandiose exhibitions, it would have been
    better to address oneself to the people and work so that each
    one could have in his home some pictures or reproductions which
    would be lessons, like the work of Millet.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">I am quite at the end of my canvas and I beg you to send me
    ten meters as soon as you can</label>. Then I am going to attack the
    cypresses and the mountains. I think that this will be the core
    of the work that I have done here and there in Provence, and
    then we can conclude my stay here when it is convenient. It is
    not urgent, for after all Paris only distracts. I don't know,
    however - not always being a pessimist - I think that I still
    have it in my heart someday to paint a book shop with the front
    yellow and pink, in the evening, and the black passersby - it
    is such an essentially modern subject. Because it seems to the
    imagination such a rich source of light - say, there would be a
    subject that would go well between an olive grove and a wheat
    field, the sowing season of books and prints. I have a great
    longing to do it like a light in the midst of darkness. Yes,
    there is a way of seeing Paris beautiful. But after all, book
    shops do not run away like hares, and there is no hurry, and I
    am quite willing to work here for another year, which will
    probably be the wisest thing to do.</p>

    <p>Mother must have been in Leyden for a fortnight now. I have
    delayed sending you the canvases for her, because I will put
    them in with <art id=0737>the picture of the &ldquo;Wheat Field&rdquo; for the Vingtistes.</art></p>

    <p>Kindest regards to Jo, she is being very good to go on being
    well. Thank you again for the paints, and the woolen waistcoat,
    and a good handshake in thought.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>
