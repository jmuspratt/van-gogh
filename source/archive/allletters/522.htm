    <p>Letter 522<br>
     Arles, c. 13 August 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have to thank you for a lot of things, first for your
    letter and the 50-fr. note enclosed, but <label content="art.materials">also just as much for
    the package of paints and canvas, which I have been to the
    station to get (the geranium lake has come too),</label> and lastly for
    the Cassagne book, and for La Fin de Lucie Pellegrin.</p>

    <p>If Tasset divided his parcels better, it would make a
    difference in the cost of carriage; there were three parcels
    this time, two of them weighing more than 5 kilos. If he had
    kept back a few tubes, the whole would have cost about 5
    francs. But I am very glad to have them all the same.</p>

    <p>Lucie Pellegrin is very fine, it is quick with life and is
    still exquisite and moving, because it keeps the human touch.
    Why should it be forbidden to handle these subjects, unhealthy
    and overexcited sexual organs seek sensual delights such as da
    Vinci's. Not I, who have hardly seen anything but the kind of
    women at 2 francs, originally intended for the Zouaves. But the
    people who have leisure for love-making, they want the da Vinci
    mysteries. I realize that these loves are not for everyone's
    understanding. But from the point of view of what is allowed,
    one could write books treating worse aberrations of perversion
    than Lesbianism, just as it would be permissible to write
    medical documents on this sort of story, surgical
    disquisitions.</p>

    <p>At all events, law and justice apart, a pretty woman is a
    living marvel, whereas the pictures by da Vinci and Correggio
    only exist for other reasons. Why am I so little an artist that
    I always regret that the statue and the picture are not alive?
    Why do I understand the musician better, why do I see the
    raison d'&ecirc;tre of his abstractions better?</p>

    <p>At the first opportunity I will send you an engraving after
    a drawing by Rowlandson, representing two women, as beautiful
    as a Fragonard or a Goya. Just now we are having a glorious
    strong heat, with no wind, just what I want. There is a sun, a
    light that for want of a better word I can only call yellow,
    pale sulphur yellow, pale golden citron. How lovely yellow is!
    And how much better I shall see the North!</p>

    <p>Oh! I keep wishing for the day when you will see and feel
    the sun of the South!</p>

    <p>As to studies, I have two <art id=0447>studies of thistles in an
    uncultivated field</art>, <art id=0447a>thistles white with the fine dust of the
    road</art>. Then a <art id=0445>little study of a roadside inn, with red and green carts</art>; and
    also <art id=0446>a little study of Paris-Lyons-Mediterran&eacute;e
    carriages</art>; these last two studies have been
    approved of as having &ldquo;quite the modern touch&rdquo; by
    the young rival of good old General Boulanger, the very
    resplendent 2<sup>nd</sup> lieutenant of Zouaves.</p>

    <p>This valiant warrior has given up the art of drawing, into
    the mysteries of which I endeavored to initiate him, but it was
    for a plausible reason, namely that he had unexpectedly to take
    an examination, for which I am afraid he was anything but
    prepared.</p>

    <p>Always supposing the aforesaid young Frenchman always speaks
    the truth, he has astonished his examiners by the confidence of
    his answers, a confidence he had reinforced by spending the eve
    of the examination in a brothel.</p>

    <p>As Fran&ccedil;ois Copp&eacute;e, I think, says in a sonnet,
    one might have &ldquo;a despairing doubt&rdquo; on the subject
    of &ldquo;my lieutenant to be,&rdquo; for, Copp&eacute;e goes
    on, &ldquo;my thoughts are on our defeat.&rdquo; The fact
    remains that I have nothing to complain of in him, and if it is
    true that he will shortly be a full-fledged lieutenant, one
    must anyhow acknowledge his luck. He is literally like the good
    old general in that he has often frequented the pretty ladies
    of the so-called caf&eacute;-chantant type. It will be enough
    for me to write you, or rather he will send you a wire telling
    you by what train he will arrive on the 16th or 17th. Then he
    will hand over the painted studies, which will save us the cost
    of carriage. He owes me all that anyhow for my lessons. He will
    only stay in Paris one or two days, as he is going North, but
    on his return he will stop there longer.</p>

    <p>After such coolness it is rather kind of Uncle to have left
    you a legacy, <label content="Theo.work">but I cannot easily get it into my head that C.
    M. and he did not actually condemn you to penal servitude for
    life that time they refused to lend you the capital necessary
    to set you up in business for yourself. This will always remain
    a grave error on their part.</label> But I won't harp on that. All the
    more reason for trying to do the utmost in art, even if we
    shall always be in comparatively straitened circumstances as
    far as money is concerned. Well, my boy, at the time you were
    <i>ready for your part</i> to set up in business, and
    consequently you have a perfect right to feel that you are
    doing <i>your duty for your part</i>. Considered as a whole,
    you have taken up this business of the impressionists with
    their help. Without their help the thing can't go on; or will
    go on in some different way. If you have made no profit yet,
    you have deserved something, and if the Dutch confound these
    two very different things, having only their word
    &ldquo;verdienen&rdquo; for both meanings, so much the worse
    for them.</p>

    <p>I am writing a line to Mourier too - you can read it - and I
    give you a hearty handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">With regard to Gauguin, however much we appreciate him, I
    think that we must behave like the mother of a family and
    calculate the actual expenses. If one listened to him, one
    would go on hoping for something vague in the future, and
    meantime stay on at the inn, and go on living in a hell with no
    way out.</p>

    <p>I would rather shut myself up in a cloister like the monks,
    free as the monks are to go to the brothel or the wine shop if
    the spirit moves us. But for our work we need a home.
    Altogether Gauguin leaves me quite in the dark about Pont-Aven;
    he tacitly accepts my suggestion of coming to him if necessary,
    but he writes nothing about any means of finding a studio of
    our own, or about what it would cost to furnish it. And I can't
    help feeling there's something queer about it.</label></p>

    <p>So I have decided not to go to Pont-Aven, unless we could
    find a house there at a low rent like the one here (15 fr. per
    month is what mine costs) and could arrange it so that we could
    sleep in it.</p>

    <p>I am going to write our sister this evening if I can find
    time.</p>

    <p>A handshake. Vincent</p>

    <p>Have you got the drawings of the gardens, and the two figure
    drawings? I think that the picture of the old peasant's head is
    as strange in colour as the Sower, but the Sower is a failure,
    and the peasant is more what it should be. Oh, as to that - I
    will send it to you all by itself as soon as it is dry, and I
    am going to put a dedication to you on it.</p>
