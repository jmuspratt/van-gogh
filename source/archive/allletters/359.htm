  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>One of these days I am going to send you another pen-and-ink
    drawing of a weaver - larger than the other five; the loom seen
    from the front - it will make this little series of drawings
    more complete; I believe they will look best if you have them
    mounted on grey Ingres.</p>

    <p>It would rather disappoint me if you sent these little
    weavers back to me. And if none of the people you know would
    care to take them, I should think that you might take them for
    yourself, as the beginning of a collection of pen-and-ink
    drawings of Brabant artisans.</p>

    <p>Which I should love to make, and which, as I shall be in
    Brabant pretty often now, I should be very eager to do.</p>

    <p>On condition of making a series of them, which must be kept
    together, I will price them low, so that though I might make
    many drawings of the same kind, they might be kept together.
    But I, for my part, will agree to what you think best.</p>

    <p>And you see it is not my aim to break off relations with
    you; I only wanted to point out that it seemed necessary to me
    that, when I send the pen drawings, you at least show them to
    somebody.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">As to the matter you wrote me about, I think in such a case,
    when one sees no possibility of carrying it through, there is
    one thing one must not forget.</p>

    <p>That is, if the woman has loved you, has really cared for
    you, and you for her, this period of love is a piece of good
    fortune in life.</p>

    <p>She, the woman, may be beautiful or plain, young or old,
    better or worse, that affects it only indirectly. The only
    thing that matters is that you have loved each other. On
    parting - don't smother it or try to forget it - the only cliff
    to be avoided then <i>is</i> that of self-righteousness, one
    must not pretend then that the woman is under great obligations
    to the man, one must part as if one were under an obligation
    oneself - that is, in my opinion, more courteous and humane -
    perhaps that is your opinion too. Love always brings
    difficulties, that is true, but the good side of it is that it
    gives energy.</label></p>

    <p>Of myself I believe - and I think it possible that it is the
    same with you - that I have not yet had enough experience with
    women. What we were taught about them in our youth is quite
    wrong, that is sure, it was quite contrary to nature, and one
    must try to learn from experience. It would be very pleasant if
    everybody were good, and the world were good, etc. - yes - but
    it seems to me that we see more and more that we are not good,
    no more than the world in general, of which we are an atom -
    and the world no more good than we are. One may try one's best,
    or act carelessly, the result is always different from what one
    really wanted. But whether the result be better or worse,
    fortunate or unfortunate, it is better to do something than to
    <i>do nothing</i>. If only one is wary of becoming a prim,
    self-righteous prig - as Uncle Vincent calls it - one may be
    even as good as one likes. Well, goodbye,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
