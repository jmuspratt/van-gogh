  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter and <label content="art.support">the samples of absorbent
    canvas, I shall be very glad to have it, but there is no hurry
    at all, 3 meters of the stuff at 6 Fr.</label></p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">As to the paints you sent, there are only four large tubes
    of white, and all the other tubes of white are half-sized. If
    he has charged for them accordingly, it's all right, but look
    into it. Four tubes of white at 1 Fr., but the rest ought only
    to be half-price. I find that his Prussian blue and his
    cinnabar are bad. The rest are good.</label></p>

    <p>Now I must tell you that I am working at 2 pictures of which
    I want to make copies. <art id=0394>The pink peach tree gives me the most
    trouble.</art></p>

    <p><?showImage("577_V-T_4770");?>
    </p>

    <p>You see from the three squares on the other side of this
    page that the three orchards make a series, more or less. I
    have also just now a little pear tree, vertical, between two
    horizontal canvases. That will make six canvases of orchards in
    bloom. I am now trying every day to touch them up and give them
    a certain unity.</p>

    <p>I dare hope for three more, matching in the same way, but so
    far they have got no further than embryos or fetuses.</p>

    <p>I should like very much to do this series of nine canvases.
    You see, we may consider this year's nine canvases as the first
    idea for a definitive decoration a great deal bigger (this
    present one consists of size 25 and 12 canvases), which would
    be carried out along just the same lines next year at the same
    season.</p>

    <p><art id=0405>Here is the other middle piece of the size 12 canvases. The
    ground violet, in the background a wall with straight poplars
    and a very blue sky. The little pear tree has a violet trunk
    and white flowers, with a big yellow butterfly on one of the
    clusters. To the left in the corner, a little
    garden with a fence of yellow reeds, and green bushes, and a
    flower bed. A little pink house</art>. There now, you have the
    details of this decoration scheme of orchards in bloom that I
    have planned for you.</p>

    <p>But the last three pictures exist only provisionally; they
    should represent a very big orchard surrounded by cypresses and
    great pear trees and apple trees.</p>

    <p><art id=571>The Pont de l'Anglais for you</art> is coming along well, and will
    be better <art id=397>than the study</art>, I think. I am very anxious to get
    back to work. As to the Guillaumin, surely it would be a good
    bargain if it's possible to buy it. Only since they are talking
    of a new method of fixing pastels, it would perhaps be wise to
    ask him to fix it in this way if you do buy it.</p>

    <p>With a handshake for you and Koning,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I have had a letter from Bernard with some sonnets he has
    concocted and some of them really come off quite well. He'll
    manage to write a good sonnet yet: a thing I could very nearly
    envy him.</p>

    <p>As soon as the Pont de l'Anglais and the copy of the other
    picture, the pink peach tree, are dry, I'll send them off.</p>
