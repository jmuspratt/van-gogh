    <p>Letter T30 <sup>1</sup><br>
     Paris, 29 March 1890</p>

    <p>Dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Among all the letters from brothers and sisters which you
    will receive tomorrow, mine may not be wanting to wish you the
    best of luck, which I do at the same time on behalf of your
    little namesake, who cannot do so very well for himself as yet.
    What he does do is look at Uncle Vincent's pictures with a good
    deal of interest - <art id=0671>the tree in blossom especially</art>,
    which is hanging over his bed, seems to enthrall him -
    and further the Rembrandt, although I cannot assert confidently
    that it is not the gilt frame which attracts him in the latter
    case. I am happy to say he is growing well, and we long to show
    him to you. But being a father and a mother is quite an art -
    perhaps because I had to learn to get used to so many things in
    the course of that one year - for I never heard other people
    speak of it in the same way - they had a baby and then
    everything was all right and things straightened themselves out
    of their own accord - but it's not like that at all with me.
    What amazes me most is that such a little child has so much of
    a personality, against which you are utterly powerless. Now and
    then he looks at me as if he wanted to say, &ldquo;What are you
    doing to me? - I know much more about things than you
    do.&rdquo; His are the eyes of an adult and then with a lot of
    expression. Is it possible that he has the makings of a
    philosopher?</p>

    <p>He does not allow his mother much leisure, but I managed to
    escape for a little while at the opening of the Independents to
    see your pictures there - there was a seat directly in front of
    them, and while Theo was talking to all sorts of people I sat
    there for a whole fifteen minutes enjoying the delicious
    coolness and freshness of <art id=0609>the &ldquo;Undergrowth&rdquo;</art>
    - it's as though I knew this spot, and had been there
    several times - I'm so fond of it.</p>

    <p>Here is the height of summer - indescribably hot - and I
    dread the hot days yet to come. I know it sounds a bit like
    sacrilege now that there is that fine delicate haze of green
    all over the trees, but I prefer winter after all. I shall have
    to close this letter in a hurry, for Theo is waiting for
    it.</p>

    <p>With best wishes,</p>

    <p>Affectionately yours, Jo</p>
