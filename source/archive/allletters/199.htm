  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Because Christine suffered from cramps, etc., I thought it
    would be a good thing for her to go to Leyden once more to find
    out exactly how things are. She has been there and has come
    back already; thank God she is all right, but, as you know, in
    March she had an operation, and has now been examined again.
    She needs care and must continue to eat strengthening food and
    also have some more baths if possible; but there are no
    complications, and there is every chance she will pull
    through.</p>

    <p>In March the professor could not tell exactly when she would
    be confined, but he thought it would be the end of May or the
    beginning of June. Now he says it will probably be late in
    June. This time he asked her many questions about whom she was
    living with, and from what he said about it, I now know for
    sure what I had guessed - that she would die if she had to walk
    the streets again, and when I met her this winter it was only
    just in time to give her the help she needed.</p>

    <p>So, as I wrote you, I wouldn't think of leaving her - under
    the circumstances it would be a mean trick.</p>

    <p>The doctor found her better than in March; the child is
    alive and he has given her some instructions about food, etc.,
    so that I do not have to act in the dark.</p>

    <p>The baby's clothes are also ready, of course the very
    simplest. I am not living in a castle in the air or in a dream,
    but in plain reality, where one must act with firmness.</p>

    <p>Under the circumstances I know no better way for either of
    us than marrying her. As I wrote you, the kind tone of your
    letter of May 13 was more than I expected. I had no illusions,
    and expected that you would quite disapprove of my behaviour
    and would withdraw your help. And even now I hardly dare hope
    that your help will continue, because I know that in the eyes
    of most people in your position such an act is a capital crime
    punishable by a sort of banishment. So I am longing very much
    for your next letter, also to hear if you have received the
    drawings. But I have no illusions about it. Only I would not be
    sincere if I said anything to you other than that it is my
    decided intention to marry her as soon as possible. The reasons
    you give are not strong enough to make me give it up, though
    there is a great deal of truth in some of your remarks,
    especially when considered by themselves.</p>

    <p>And now, to tell you the truth, I really need some more
    money this month,<label content="food-and-drink.preference"> though I paid for the bread up to the first
    of June and laid in some provisions like coffee, etc.</label></p>

    <p>Of course, since you tell me nothing's wrong as I imagined,
    I will certainly finish the order for C. M.; I have already
    made the studies. However, it will take me about three weeks to
    get those six drawings, for in order to get six good ones, I
    shall have to make more than six in addition to the work I have
    already done. I do not know how much I shall get for them, but
    I shall do my best, so I hope I shall get the money in
    June.</p>

    <p>If there is some good in my behaviour toward Christine after
    all, it is more to <i>your</i> credit than to <i>mine</i>, as I
    was and am only the instrument - without your help I should
    have been powerless.</p>

    <p>The money you sent has helped me on with my drawing, and
    moreover, up to now it has saved Christine's and the child's
    lives. But in a sense it would be my fault if you took it as a
    breach of confidence; I hope you won't.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
