  <body>
    <p>Dear Mother and Theo,</p>

    <p>Tomorrow the boys go home, and then I shall receive my
    money. I asked Mr. Jones to let me go to you those three days,
    my heart is so with you. It depends now on you both - if you
    say that I may come, Mr. Jones will let me go. Besides longing
    to sit at Theo's bedside,<label content="feelings.homesick"> I should like so much to see my
    mother again and, if possible, also go to Etten to see Father
    and speak with him. It would only be for a short time; I should
    be with you but for one or two days.</label></p>

    <p>Monday last, I was again in Richmond, and my subject was,
    &ldquo;He has sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor&rdquo;;
    but whoever wants to preach the Gospel must carry it in his own
    heart first. Oh! May I find it, for it is only the word spoken
    in earnestness and from the fullness of the heart that can bear
    fruit. Perhaps I shall go to London or Lewisham again one of
    these days.</p>

    <p>Just now I gave a German lesson to Mr. Jones's daughters,
    and after the lesson I told them the story of Andersen's
    &ldquo;The Snow Queen.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If you can, let me know by the next mail if I may come; I
    was so happy over Mother's last letter.</p>

    <p>One of these days I hope to visit Mr. Stokes's school. And I
    shall have to buy a pair of new boots to get myself ready for
    new wanderings.</p>

    <p>The view from the window of your little room must be fine
    now - you see, I know it from long ago. We are having a great
    deal of rain here at present, in Holland I suppose it is the
    same. At Christmas I shall have a fortnight or three weeks to
    go to Holland; if Anna can go too, we might come together.<label content="Theo.health"> And
    now winter is slowly approaching again - try to be your old
    self by that time.</label> How welcome is that Christmastime in winter.
    Oh! my boy, I look forward so much to the time when it will be
    cold here and I shall have to make my rounds at Turnham
    Green.</p>

    <p>When I think of you as one &ldquo;who comforts his mother,
    and who is worthy to be comforted by his mother,&rdquo; I
    almost envy you. But try to get better soon. Yesterday, I asked
    Mr. Jones to let me go to Holland, but he would not allow it,
    and at last he said, &ldquo;Write to your mother; if she
    approves, I will too.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>What beautiful poems are De Genestet's <sup>1</sup>
    &ldquo;On the Mountains of Sorrow&rdquo; and &ldquo;When I was
    a Boy.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>A handshake for both of you and for the Roos family, and for
    Willem and any others you see whom I know. And let me hear soon
    from you again and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
