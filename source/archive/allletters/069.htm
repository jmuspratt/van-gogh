  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>On Monday last, I travelled from Ramsgate to London. That is
    quite a stroll, the moment that I started on my way, it became
    very hot, and the same heat waited for me on my arrival at
    Canterbury. That evening, I pushed on a little bit too long;
    finally I halted in a place where there were many beech trees
    and some elms at the edge of a pond; there I rested for a
    while. The following morning at half past three, when the birds
    started singing to salute the first light of dawn, I started
    off again. Ah! That was a good walk!</p>

    <p>At midday I had made Chatham, where one can see in the
    distance, in the middle of partial flooding of low-lying
    meadows, the Thames where the boats go; I thought the weather
    was always grey in these parts.</p>

    <p>It was there that I met a cart, which took me a few miles
    further, but then the driver went into an inn, and as I
    supposed I would have to wait a long time, I continued on my
    way. I arrived at the fall of night in the familiar suburbs of
    London and I wound my way through the town by long, long
    `roads'. I stayed two days in London, I walked many times from
    one place to another in the city to make certain visits,
    particularly to a pastor to whom I had already written. I have
    enclosed a copy of this letter, I sent it to you to let you
    know that I started to write with the sentiment of
    &ldquo;Father, I am not worthy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Father, have
    pity on me&rdquo;.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">If I find work it will tend towards a position between
    clergyman and missionary in the suburbs of London, mainly to
    the working class population.</label></p>

    <p>Don't breathe a word to anyone about this new idea, Theo. My
    salary at Mr. Stokes's is probably very small, just enough for
    room and board, then a few hours of freedom to give particular
    lessons; if there is no free time to spare, I earn all in all
    eight pounds per year.</p>

    <p>I continue with my story. I stayed one night with Mr. Reid,
    the following night with Mr. Gladwell, where they showed great
    gentleness toward me. Mr. Gladwell kissed me goodnight that
    evening and it did me good; may it be given to me in the future
    to prove my friendship for his son now and then. I wanted to go
    on to Welwyn that very evening, but they kept me back literally
    by force because of the pouring rain. However, when it began to
    let up a little about four o'clock in the morning, I set off
    for Welwyn.</p>

    <p>First a long walk from one end of the city to the other,
    about ten miles (twenty minutes walking each mile). I arrived
    at five o'clock in the afternoon at our sister's house, I was
    happy to see her. She looks well, and her room has Good Friday,
    Christ in the Garden of Olives, Mater Dolorosa<i>,</i> etc. not
    framed, but surrounded by ivy, surely very pleasing.</p>

    <p>My boy, you will think on reading my letter to the pastor:
    &rdquo;He is not so bad, he's good!&rdquo; But I am sure he is.
    Whatever he may be, think of him once in a while. A firm
    handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Enclosed letter.]</p>

    <p>Reverend Sir,</p>

    <p>A clergyman's son who, because he has to work for his
    living, has neither the time nor the money to keep up studies
    at King's College, and is in any case already a few years older
    than is usual for those who go there and has not yet even
    started the preliminary studies in Latin and Greek, would, all
    this notwithstanding, be very glad to find a position connected
    with the church, albeit the position of a university-educated
    clergyman is beyond his reach.</p>

    <p>My father is a clergyman in a village in Holland. I went to
    school when I was 11, staying on until I was 16. I then had to
    choose a profession and did not know which to choose. Through
    the kind offices of one of my uncles, a partner in the firm of
    Goupil &amp; Cie, art dealers and publishers of engravings, I
    obtained a position in his business in The Hague. I was
    employed in this business for 3 years. From there I went to
    London to learn English and, after 2 years, moved on to Paris.
    Various circumstances have, however, compelled me to leave
    Messrs. G. &amp; Cie., and for the past two months I have been
    teaching at Mr. Stokes's school in Ramsgate. But since my aim
    is a position in connection with the church, I must look
    elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Although I have not been trained for the church, perhaps my
    past experience of travels, of living in different countries,
    of associations with various people, poor and rich, religious
    and irreligious, of work of various kinds, days of manual
    labour followed by days of office work, &amp;c., perhaps also
    my ability to speak various languages, may in part make up for
    my not having been to a university.</p>

    <p>But the reason I would much sooner give for commending
    myself to you is my innate love of the church and everything to
    do with the church, which may lie dormant from time to time but
    always reawakens; and, if I may say so, although with a sense
    of great inadequacy and imperfection: the Love of God and of
    man.</p>

    <p>And also, when I think of my past life and of my father's
    house in the village in Holland, a sense of: `Father, I have
    sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy
    to be called thy Son: make me as one of thy hired servants. Be
    merciful to me a sinner.'</p>

    <p>When I lived in London I often attended your church and have
    not forgotten you. Now I would ask for your recommendation as I
    look for a position, and also that you keep your fatherly eye
    on me should I find such a position. I have been left a good
    deal to myself, and I believe your fatherly eye will do me
    good, now that:</p>

    <p>The early dew of morning</p>

    <p>has passed away at noon.</p>

    <p>Thanking you in anticipation for what you may feel able to
    do for me&hellip;</p>
