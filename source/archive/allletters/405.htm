  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>This afternoon I received your letter and will answer it at
    once. I am anxious to get some idea of the Salon, especially of
    the picture by Roll.</p>

    <p>I'm not surprised that, for instance, Durand Ruel has not
    yet taken any notice of the drawings.</p>

    <p>And I should even prefer that Portier did not exaggerate his
    admiration of them - at least I feel I can do better, just
    because I am now changing again, so much so that I think my
    former work but hesitantly done.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique"><art id=0082>I think you will see what I mean in the picture of the
    potato eaters, I think Portier will understand. It is very
    dark, however, and in the white, for instance, hardly any white
    has been used, but simply the neutral colour, which is made by
    mixing red, blue, yellow, for instance vermilion, Paris blue
    and Naples yellow.</art></p>

    <p>Therefore that colour is in itself a pretty dark grey, but
    in the picture it looks white.</label></p>

    <p>I'll tell you why I do it that way. Here the subject is a
    grey interior, lit by a little lamp.</p>

    <p>The dirty linen tablecloth, the smoky wall, the dirty caps
    in which the women have worked in the field - <i>when seen
    through the eyelashes</i> in the light of the lamp, all this
    proves to be <i>very</i> dark grey; and the lamp, though a
    yellow-reddish glow, is even lighter - even a great deal - than
    the white in question.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">As to the flesh colours - I know quite well that considered
    superficially, that is without thinking about it, they seem
    <i>what is called</i> flesh colour.</p>

    <p>But when starting the picture, I tried to paint them that
    way, with yellow ochre, red ochre and white, for instance.</p>

    <p>But that was much, much <i>too light</i> and was decidedly
    wrong.</p>

    <p>What was to be done? All the heads were finished, and even
    finished with great care, but I immediately repainted them,
    inexorably, and the colour they are painted in now is like
    <i>the colour of a very dusty potato, unpeeled of
    course</i>.</label></p>

    <p>While doing this I thought how perfect that saying of
    Millet's about the peasants is: &ldquo;Ses paysans semblant
    peints avec la terre qu'ils ensemencent.&rdquo; [These peasants
    seem to be painted with the soil in which they have been
    planting.]</p>

    <p>A saying which I can't help being constantly reminded of
    when I see them at work outdoors as well as indoors.</p>

    <p>And I am quite sure that if one asked Millet, Daubigny or
    Corot to paint a snow landscape without using white, they would
    do it, <i>and the snow would look white in the picture</i>.</p>

    <p>What you say about <art id=1661>the lithograph,</art> that the effect is wooly,
    I think too, and it is not my own fault in that the
    lithographer insisted that, as I had left hardly any white on
    the stone, it would not print well. At this suggestion I had
    the light spots corroded; if I had simply printed it as the
    drawing was, the general effect would have been darker, but not
    crude, and there would have been atmosphere between the planes.
    But what should I do with the picture? It is the same size as
    last year's woman spinning.</p>

    <p>Just now I again took it to the cottage to give it some last
    touches from nature. But I think I shall get it finished,
    always in a comparative sense, for in reality I shall never
    think my own work ready or finished.</p>

    <p><?showImage("487_V-T_4050");?>
     I can do it in a smaller size, however, or make a drawing of
    it if you prefer it, for the thing is so fixed in my mind that
    I could literally almost paint it with my eyes shut.</p>

    <p>Can you see how splendid the thing I scratch here was?</p>

    <p>When I went to the cottage tonight, I found the people at
    supper in the light of the small window instead of under the
    lamp - oh, it was splendid! The colour was extraordinary too;
    you remember <art id=0070a>those heads</art><art id=1229v>
    painted</art> against<art id=0070> the window</art> - the
    effect was like that, but even darker.</p>

    <p>So the two women and the interior were exactly the colour of
    dark soft soap. But the figure of the man to the left was just
    lit up by light streaming through a door farther on. So the
    head and hands became the colour of a 10-centime piece, namely
    dull brass. And where the light touched it, the blouse became
    of the most tender faded blue.</p>

    <p>In your next letter tell me, please, what you want me to do
    with the picture. Of course we must see to it that Portier gets
    something new. But I can just as well copy it in half-size for
    him, and send this large one to Antwerp, for instance.</p>

    <p>As to the <i>light</i> pictures at present, I have seen so
    little of them these last years.</p>

    <p>But I have thought a great deal about the question itself.
    Corot, Millet, Daubigny, Isra&euml;ls, Dupr&eacute; and others
    <i>also paint light pictures</i>, that is to say, one can see
    through every corner and depth, however deep the colour scale
    may be.</p>

    <p>But those painters mentioned above, none of them paint the
    local tone literally; they follow the colour scale in which
    they started, express their own ideas in colour and tone and
    drawing. And that their light is generally a rather dark grey
    in itself, which gives the impression of being light in the
    picture, is a truth which you have the opportunity to observe
    daily.</p>

    <p>Well, goodbye. <label content="art.influences">Understand me well - I do not say that Millet
    didn't use white when he painted snow, but I mean that he and
    the other tonists could have done so if they had wanted to, in
    the same way as Delacroix tells that Paul Veronese painted
    pale, fair, nude women with a colour which, considered
    separately, looked like street dirt.</label></p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I think you will see from the picture that I have my own way
    of looking at things, but that there is some conformity with
    others, for instance, certain Belgians. What a shame they
    refused Josephson's picture. But why don't the rejected
    painters join hands and do something for themselves? Union is
    strength.</p>
