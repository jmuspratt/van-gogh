  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter and the 100-fr. note it
    contained.<label content="art.influences"> Milliet also came this morning, bringing me the
    package of Japanese stuff and other things. Among them I very
    much like the cabaret in two sheets, with the line of violet
    girl musicians against the yellow lighted wall - I did not know
    that print, and there are several others which were unknown to
    me; there is one, a woman's head, which must belong to a good
    school.</label></p>

    <p>I have just bought a dressing table with everything
    necessary, and my own little room is complete. The other one,
    Gauguin's or another lodger's, still needs a dressing table and
    a chest of drawers, and downstairs I shall need a big frying
    pan and a cupboard.</p>

    <p>There is no hurry for this, and already I can see myself
    earning enough to be safe for a long time to come.</p>

    <p>You cannot think what peace of mind it gives me, I am so set
    on making an artist's home, but one for practical use, and not
    the ordinary studio full of knick-knacks.</p>

    <p>I am also thinking of planting two oleanders in tubs in
    front of the door.</p>

    <p>After all we shall probably spend several times fewer
    hundreds of francs than Russell, for example, will spend
    thousands. And truly, even if I could choose between the two,
    for my own part I should rather have the hundred-franc method,
    so long as every piece of furniture is solid and big.</p>

    <p>But the room where I shall put up anybody who comes this way
    will be like a boudoir, and when it is finished, you will see
    that it will not be a haphazard production, but a deliberate
    creation.</p>

    <p>The text of Bing's Japon is rather dry, and leaves something
    to be desired; he says there is a great individual art, but
    though he gives a few scraps of it, he gives you no real
    impression of the character of that art.</p>

    <p>Have you read Madame Chrysanth&egrave;me yet?</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">The sense of tranquillity that the house has bought me
    mainly amounts to this - that from now on I feel I am working
    to provide for the future, so that after me another painter
    will find a going concern. I shall need time, but I am obsessed
    with the idea of painting such decorations for the house as
    will be worth the money spent on me during the years in which I
    was unproductive.</label></p>

    <p>Mother's photograph gave me very great pleasure, because you
    can see that she is well, and because she still has such a
    lively expression. But I do not care for it at all as a real
    likeness; I have just painted <art id=0476>my own portrait, in the same
    ashen colouring</art>, and unless we are painted in colour, the
    result is nowhere near a speaking likeness. Just because I had
    taken a terrific amount of trouble to get the combination of
    ashen and grey-pink tones, I could not like the portrait in
    black and white. Would Germinie Lacerteux really be Germinie
    Lacerteux without her colour? Obviously not. How I would like
    to have painted portraits of her own family.</p>

    <p>For the second time I have scraped off a study of Christ
    with the angel in the Garden of Olives. You see, I can see real
    olives here, but I cannot or rather I will not paint any more
    without models; but I have the thing in my head with the
    colours, a starry night, the figure of Christ in blue, all the
    strongest blues, and the angel blended citron-yellow. And every
    shade of violet, from a blood-red purple to ashen, in the
    landscape.</p>

    <p>I have been to get five size 30 stretchers, so I have even
    more ideas. I'm having the pictures that I'm keeping here
    framed in oak and walnut.</p>

    <p>It will take time, but you'll see later on.</p>

    <p>I hope that you will give me some details of your visit to
    Maurin. I like the drawing of the two women in the carriage
    tremendously.</p>

    <p>Even if it is some time before anyone comes here to stay
    with me, it won't make me change my mind about this step being
    urgent and being useful in the long run. This art that we are
    working in, we feel it has a long future before it, and one
    must be quietly settled, like steady people, and not like
    decadents. Here my life will become more and more like a
    Japanese painter's, living close to nature like a petty
    tradesman. And that, you well know, is a less gloomy affair
    than the decadent's way. If I can live long enough, I shall be
    something like old Tanguy.</p>

    <p>After all, we don't really know anything about our own
    personal future, but we nevertheless feel that impressionism
    will last. Good-by for the present and good luck, and many,
    many thanks for all your kindness. I think that I shall put the
    Japanese things downstairs in the studio. A handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
