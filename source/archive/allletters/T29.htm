    <p>Letter T29<br>
     Paris, 29 March 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>We were very pleased to receive your last letter, but we
    regret from the bottom of our hearts that you cannot give us
    better news. You will need an enormous amount of patience to
    surmount the trouble your condition must give you. At any rate
    there is a tendency toward improvement, which we ought to be
    glad of to begin with. Cold weather has always had some
    influence upon you, and so it's possible that milder weather
    will put you on your feet again altogether, at least let's hope
    so, and don't tire yourself too much.</p>

    <p>How happy I should have been if you could have gone to the
    Exhibition of the Independents. It was the Preview Showing
    <sup>1</sup>, when Carnot <sup>2</sup> was there. I was there
    with Jo; your pictures are very well placed and make a good
    effect. A lot of people came to us and asked us to send you
    their compliments. Gauguin said that your pictures were the
    chief attraction of the exhibition - the &ldquo;clou,&rdquo; he
    said. He proposed an exchange of one of his canvases for <art id=0662>one of
    the Alpine foothills</art>. I told him I supposed
    you would not object, but that on the contrary you would be
    very pleased to know that he likes your picture. I like it very
    much too - that picture, I mean - it makes an admirable
    impression in the exhibition.</p>

    <p>Seurat is showing a very curious picture there in which he
    has made an effort to express things by means of the direction
    of the lines. He certainly gives the impression of motion, but
    it has a very queer appearance, and it is not very generous
    from the standpoint of ideas. Guillaumin has a good many things
    on view, including some very good pieces; de Lautrec has an
    excellent <art id=autrec>portrait of a woman at the piano</art>, and a large picture
    which is very striking. Notwithstanding its scabrous theme it
    has great distinction. In general it is to be observed that the
    public is beginning to get more and more interested in the
    young impressionists; at least there are a certain number of
    art lovers who have started buying. The exhibition of
    Pissarro's work is over; a lot of people came to see it, and
    five pieces were sold. For the moment it was all that we could
    hope for.</p>

    <p>Bernard and Aurier intend to come to see your latest
    pictures next Sunday. Enclosed you will find a letter from
    Aurier. He will be back before long to look at the Gauguins,
    and to write an article about him.</p>

    <p><label content="business.sales">I received the money from your picture from Brussels, and
    Maus writes me, &ldquo;As soon as an opportunity presents
    itself please tell your brother that I was extremely glad of
    his participation in the Salon of the `XX,' where he has found
    many lively artistic sympathies in the confusion of the
    discussions.&rdquo; Do you want me to send you the money? I
    shall hold it for you as long as you wish.</label></p>

    <p>I hope, my dear brother, that you will be able to give us a
    more satisfactory report on your health very soon. If only you
    could see your little namesake you would feel happier. Try to
    find out from Dr. Peyron whether he sees any danger in your
    coming to Paris as soon as you have recovered from this crisis.
    Jo gives you her kindest regards, and joins me in expressing
    best wishes for your prompt recovery.</p>

    <p>A cordial handshake.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>
