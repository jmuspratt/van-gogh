    <p>[Letter to A. H. Koning, reprinted from the evening issue of
    the Amsterdam newspaper <i>De Telegraaf</i> of Tuesday,
    November 28, 1933. See also letter 571a.]</p>

    <p>My dear friend Koning,</p>

    <p>Having heard from Theo that you are going back to Holland, I
    want to write you a few farewell words. I take it you have
    managed to see the impressionists at Durand Ruel's. You'll have
    quite a lot to tell those fellows in Holland about what you've
    seen in Paris.</p>

    <p>I was much pleased to hear from Theo that you are in good
    health. We can hardly do without it in our kind of work.
    Tomorrow I am going to Saintes-Maries on the seacoast to have a
    look at the blue sea and the blue sky. And to try to get an
    idea of the figures. For I suppose that all at once I shall
    make a furious onslaught on the figure, which I seem to be
    giving a wide berth at the moment, as if I were not interested
    in it, although it is really what I aim at.</p>

    <p>In the meantime I am getting rather sunburned. People here
    are sunburned yellow or orange, and now and then red-ochre.</p>

    <p>It rather surprises me that I have not yet heard whether the
    exchange of our pictures will come off - I hope it will.</p>

    <p>I have just finished<art id=1452> a drawing</art>, even larger than the first
    two, of a cluster of straight pines on a rock, seen from the
    top of a hill. Behind this foreground a perspective of meadows,
    a road with poplars, and in the far distance the town. The
    trees very dark against the sunlit meadow; perhaps you will get
    an opportunity to see this drawing.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I did it with very thick reeds on thin Whatman paper, and in
    the background I worked with a quill for the finer strokes.</p>

    <p>I can recommend this method to you, for the quill strokes
    are more in character than those of the reed.</label></p>

    <p>I am very pleased to hear that you have been able to see my
    first consignment; I hope there will be some marines in the
    next one, and after that &hellip; the figure.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">This is what I am aiming at, only it seemed to me that
    walking and working in the open air would be better for my
    health, and I did not want to start on the figure before
    feeling stronger.</label></p>

    <p>Well, old fellow, I know I shall often think of our meetings
    in Paris, and I do not doubt we shall hear from you as soon as
    you are back in Holland. It is an excellent thing that you are
    returning in good health and good spirits.</p>

    <p>If you come back next year, do come and have a look here
    too. I wish you could see the colour here.</p>

    <p>I am very anxious to see the region I am going to visit
    tomorrow and to see the sea. At present there are bullfights
    almost every Sunday. Last Sunday a bull jumped the hoarding and
    made a rush at the spectators' seats, but the arenas here are
    built so high that no harm can be done. On the other hand, once
    in a neighboring village a bull jumped out of the enclosure,
    broke through the ring of spectators, injuring several of them,
    and after that rushed through the village.</p>

    <p>At the end of the village, which is built on a rock, there
    is an enormously high, steep cliff; in his fury the bull rushed
    on, and - got smashed down below.</p>

    <p>A cordial handshake in thought.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
