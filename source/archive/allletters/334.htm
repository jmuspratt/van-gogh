  <body>
    <p>Dear parents,</p>

    <p>I received your letter, many thanks.</p>

    <p>The death of cousin A. touched me too. How suddenly things
    can happen.</p>

    <p>I often thought she was not very happy, or rather, for my
    part, I do not doubt it for a single moment. I think one can
    hardly be happy as the wife of a banker, least of all nowadays.
    You will say, That's not true - but my thoughts are pretty much
    fixed about those things.</p>

    <p>There is a certain sphere which one had better avoid, in my
    opinion.</p>

    <p>To change the subject, the people of the Heike were always
    cheating each other, and I cannot say for sure that it never
    happens here. But I think that generally the people of the
    Heike proved to be very united basically, though they cheated
    each other under certain circumstances and though this was
    considered quite natural. I always found the Heike a remarkable
    example of energy, those little huts, each with a patch of
    ground, that poor little group of people struggling together
    against the barrenness of the heath - I do not deny their
    faults, but those are not the things which strike me first. So
    here I had not yet thought about whether people cheated each
    other. Now that I think of it, I suppose they do - probably it
    happens now and then - but in general what strikes me is the
    same thing I saw on a small scale in the Heike. Here things are
    generally on a larger scale and more interesting, and they have
    more character. It is something just as beautiful and well
    ordered as an ant's nest or a beehive. That's how things are,
    generally speaking - for me they are admirable as they are -
    but now what might they be basically? They might be better, I
    don't deny it - but I repeat, I see so much positive good here
    that I abstain from finding fault, especially as I am not at
    all able to distinguish coincidences from faults of character
    as yet. I must see more of it before I can decide that.</p>

    <p>Now, when I compare the population of a city with the people
    here, I do not for a moment hesitate to say that the population
    of the heath, the peat workers here, seem to me to be better.
    Yes, then the differences seem enormous, though they may cheat
    each other here, no less than at the Heike, but I do not say
    they do, I do not know it yet. Recently I had a conversation on
    the same subject with the man whom I board with, who is a
    farmer himself. It was by chance, because he asked me how
    things were in London, he had heard so much about it. I told
    him that in my opinion a simple farmer <i>who works, and works
    intelligently</i>, is the civilized man, that it has always
    been so and always will be, that in the country one finds an
    example of it here and there, and in the city one finds a few
    men who are almost as noble, though in quite a different way,
    among the very, very rare excellent people. But that in my
    opinion it goes no further, and that in general there is more
    chance of finding a reasonable human being in the country than
    in the city. And that in my opinion the nearer one gets to the
    large cities, the further one gets into the darkness of
    degeneration and stupidity and wickedness. He said, in fact,
    that he was of the same opinion.</p>

    <p>There <i>is</i> a difference, and in the country it is more
    quiet, more peaceful, a little better, too - though they may
    cheat each other, it is not so bad as in the city. Here
    beautiful, clear autumn days alternate with stormy ones. I
    really like the latter best, though it is difficult to walk
    out-of-doors then, and sometimes even quite impossible. But
    going out anyway and taking a study one has made on a fine day,
    and correcting it according to what one sees out-of-doors in
    the rain, is possible, after all, and satisfying to me.</p>

    <p>Don't worry about my health, I take care of myself, and I am
    feeling even better here these first days than <label content="psychology.neurological">during those
    last months in The Hague, when I suffered much from my nerves.
    And that is quite calmed down now.</label> I think there is no better
    place for meditation than by a rustic hearth and an old cradle
    with a baby in it, with the window overlooking a delicate green
    cornfield and the waving of the alder bushes.</p>

    <p>At present I am studying the ploughers all the time, so I
    must be off again. Goodbye, dear parents; my overcoat is all
    right, the woolen undervest is very comfortable, believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
