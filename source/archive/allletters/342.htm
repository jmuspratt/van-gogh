  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>May I draw your attention to the fact that the post of
    Monday, November 26, has just gone by, without having brought
    your letter. As it still has to go to Hoogeveen and back, we
    have now arrived at a point where it almost amounts to my
    having failed to receive one remittance, for suppose the next
    mail brings your letter, I cannot get the money before November
    28, late in the evening, or November 29 in the morning.</p>

    <p>So it is, properly speaking, a deficit, for your next
    letter, which I should otherwise have expected about December
    1st, probably won't arrive then. For since I have been here at
    Nieuw Amsterdam, the letters have been arriving later and later.
    <label content="fear.paranoia">If I had received a word of warning according to our
    arrangement, it would not rouse in me that feeling which I
    cannot help gradually getting now. That is to say that a
    certain insincerity is creeping into our relationship, which
    began by being sincere, by mutually understanding and
    respecting each other.</label></p>

    <p>That this is a disappointment to me, and worries me
    considerably, even apart from the thoughts I cannot keep from
    rising within me, is not what weighs most heavily on my mind
    today.</p>

    <p>Rather it is a vague uneasiness about you, though - perhaps
    just <i>because</i> - only yesterday I heard from home that
    they had had a good letter from you. So I should conclude from
    it that the crisis in question is suppressed, averted, stopped
    - well, whatever you like to call it. And so this would be a
    confirmation of your words to me: &ldquo;I believe that for the
    present things will remain as they are.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>About which, however, I hinted that it only half pleased me,
    or rather that it alarmed me more than it reassured me about
    your future.</p>

    <p>I only hope now that you will understand and not
    <i>mis</i>understand me.</p>

    <p>At this moment to I do not suspect you of insincerity -
    please keep this in mind as my starting point.</p>

    <p>So because I believe in you as an honest man, I consider you
    relatively safe at present in spite of difficulties, even in
    case of a catastrophe.</p>

    <p>But now I approach the point where I am afraid you are in
    danger - are vulnerable. Suppose all impending dangers were
    averted, suppose everything were quieted down, then I want to
    remind you of the English saying: &ldquo;Fear the storm but
    dread the <i>calm treacherous enchanted ground</i>.&rdquo;
    Suppose you are carried along, gently and imperceptibly, by a
    current deviating from the straight course. Suppose what I will
    call - excuse the expression - the poison of the Parisian
    atmosphere - the Jesuitism of its vapours - slowly but surely
    penetrates your pores - imperceptibly to yourself - yet the
    result would be that after some years you would become aware of
    it yourself - I am driven from the right course, I have turned
    <i>too</i> insincere, I am too little <i>myself</i>. I have
    indulged <i>too much</i> in pursuing prosperity.</p>

    <p>Brother! when you told me the other day, &ldquo;I think in
    the matter of finance I am on the trail of a new
    conception&rdquo; - what I thought of it was, in short, That's
    bad enough. I should not have thought so if you had written: In
    the matter of printing I am on the trail of something, or - I
    have discovered a number of energetic new artists, with whom I
    shall probably be able to do business, or something of the sort
    - in short, if you had discovered something in the field of
    work or art, <b>I</b> should have thought it excellent, but -
    the field of finance - pardon my saying it - it is too much in
    the air for my taste.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, do you take offense at my not being quite easy in
    my mind on your account? And in the second place do you think I
    am confusing your concerns with my own, the latter being to a
    certain extent dependent on those of yours? Granted that my
    concerns are dependent on yours, yet it is not about this that
    my mind is uneasy at present - my uneasiness is about you and
    you alone - about you as a human being - as a man - as an
    upright, honest man. And my question remains: Won't you suffer
    a loss and decline - as a human being? And if I am forced to
    put this question, it is because Paris is Paris.</p>

    <p>I do not say I am sure that I myself always have this mental
    energy, so I do not speak for myself but of another person out
    of the remote past. It is said that when he felt he was on
    enchanted ground and in an enchanted atmosphere, when he
    perceived that he was being unnerved, he resolutely left the
    island on a timber beam or a raft, and ventured on the high
    seas, thinking, the sea is less dangerous than <i>this</i>. And
    in my opinion this man was almighty wise.</p>

    <p><i>This</i>&hellip;you must excuse me from defining it, and
    just allow me to say that there are things which, as one ought
    to know, can gradually cast a spell of a man and make him
    change his course in a direction diametrically opposed to the
    course he took as long as he was honest.</p>

    <p>My words may sound gloomy, very well. For myself, there are
    moments when my own prospects seem very dark to me - but as I
    already wrote you, I do not believe that my fate depends on
    what seems against it. All kinds of things may be against me,
    but there <i>may</i> be one thing more powerful than what I see
    threatening me. I used the word fatality for lack of a better
    word - no one falls before his time - so as for me, I resign
    myself to fate, and act as if nothing were the matter.</p>

    <p>As for you, I repeat, as long as I believe in your sincerity
    (and I do not believe the contrary yet), I also believe that
    you are safe in spite of happiness or unhappiness, were it
    solely in that conscious reality - which hovers over the
    appearance of things. But I couldn't help smiling at what they
    wrote from home about a &ldquo;good&rdquo; letter, with one
    single vague word, that's all I know about it, and that it
    seemed that matters had taken a more favourable turn again. I
    thought, Very well - if you people say that you are satisfied,
    then be satisfied - I did not think more of it, however, than
    that.</p>

    <p>If that one sentence in that letter about you ended thus:
    &ldquo;But next year we expect important occurrences to take
    place, and we hope that he (that means <i>you</i>) will not
    suffer a loss in consequence of them,&rdquo; it would seem to
    me that the occurrences in question will not influence you as a
    man, but that the problem will be far more, &ldquo;What shall
    [<i>sic</i>] he do with it?&rdquo; as the English say - what
    are the qualities of his character, his soul - in short a
    problem which, in my opinion, has not yet been solved, seeing
    that to a very large extent it will depend on your own thoughts
    and your own will.</p>

    <p>But know this one thing, brother - that whatever choice you
    might make, or whatever decision you might or might not take,
    that whether you become better in my eyes, or worse, and also
    whether or not there will be more or less direct relations
    between us with respect to money or business, this will
    <i>not</i> be regarded by <i>me</i> as a reason for
    estrangement. Difference of opinion, difference in view of
    life, difference of principles, suppose they might show
    themselves later on - they haven't so far - are for <i>me
    no</i> reason to overlook the fact that we are brothers, and
    that we agree on many points. I just emphasize this to our
    mutual reassurance I hope. You are free, I am free, to act as
    it seems most reasonable to us, aren't we? And if one always
    takes this for granted, that one must not blame the other or
    become hostile, or spiteful, or throw obstacles in each other's
    way because of a possible difference of opinion - then, though
    there may come a time of greater coolness, things will, thank
    God, remain free from fanaticism or intrigue.</p>

    <p>Which, alas, is not always the case with everyone. It is the
    same with the money, which I wrote about at the beginning of my
    letter. What I mean <i>primarily</i> is, never let that become
    a point of discord between us, and bear in mind that of course
    I don't blame you in the least for not having it, even when it
    sometimes causes me terrible difficulties.</p>

    <p>As to the capital already invested in it by you and by me -
    for after all, I put my work into it, throw myself headlong
    into it - as to all these things - after all, I still cherish
    the hope that in the future it will redress itself - though,
    though - perhaps not only I, but you too on your part, have
    been mistaken in a few things, which, however, are not yet
    fatal or past remedy, and which I will not even mention now. Do
    not find in this letter nor in the preceding ones a distrust, a
    suspicion, or an insult; take it only as a warning concerning
    some Parisian things, which I want you to consider, not as if I
    were infallible, not as if I should insist on your agreeing
    with me - but because I believe I see certain symptoms which
    seem to me of an enigmatic and ominous nature.</p>

    <p>And, yes - now it <i>must</i> be said - I do not even ask
    for a reply - I even beg you not to consider this a question
    but simply a statement, in order to make quite clear to you
    that <i>within</i> my <i>general</i> uneasiness there is
    <i>another</i> uneasiness. In short, the core of many matters
    is - this woman of yours, is she good? Is she honest? Is she
    modest, does she stand on common ground, or are there some
    little weeds of a somewhat dangerous craving for what I will
    call &ldquo;greatness&rdquo; among her wheat? I was thinking of
    Lady Macbeth.</p>

    <p>Macbeth was an honest man but&hellip;but he was enchanted,
    and when he and she awoke from the bewitchment, they were
    facing more and worse wickedness than they had intended. And
    Macbeth fell - he had a <i>big</i> fall.</p>

    <p>If it is possible, reassure me - as for the calamities, I am
    not particularly afraid of <i>them</i> - in general one should
    be afraid of nothing except of deteriorating as a man. Now you
    know the most important thing I sometimes fear when I think of
    you.</p>

    <p>Here you are, I am speaking harshly now, because I wanted to
    tell you unreservedly that I should be very grateful if I could
    be reassured about this.</p>

    <p>I repeat, it is not in the least my intention to ask for
    particulars. But the fact remains that there are men who fall
    in this way. And there are also men who withdraw in time. If a
    woman is simply good, it is a blessing; but there is the danger
    that, if a woman should want to be glamorous in the eyes of the
    world, she might debase a man. Mentioning this disease is
    something different from saying that this is the case with you,
    isn't it? On the contrary, I ask you, say just one word and my
    mind will be perfectly easy, and I shall ask no more
    questions.</p>

    <p>The woman I was with - a whore, already pock-marked, already
    withered and prematurely old, already a mother of two children
    - she is not a <i>good</i> woman, que soit, but here misfortune
    has reached the height of her being <i>no longer capable</i> of
    being a Lady Macbeth; and as to temptation, if in the past
    there were a really ugly wickedness in her, her very misfortune
    has much curtailed this power to do harm (supposing it had been
    present in her), and I very much doubt whether the temptation,
    even if it had been there before, could be effective
    <i>now</i>. So I am not saying what I say because I want to
    compare notes; the very fact that there is such a difference
    obviates the chance of there being anything Lady Macbeth-like
    in my relations with this woman.<label content="Theo.mistress"> But you are confronted with a
    personality who has the power to charm, and this charm may be
    used fatally in the direction of worldly ambition.</label></p>

    <p>As far as I am concerned, because the woman I was with is a
    thoroughly unhappy person, and so heavily burdened with a
    tainted past, two children, poverty, etc., etc., that, even if
    I found no good in her, I should not want to sever all ties,
    and I should not stop seeing her to please anybody, nor
    speaking to her nor writing to her, nor sending her a little
    money when I happen to have it. Let people think and say what
    they like about it, all right, I have long ceased to take it
    ill of them.</p>

    <p>But look here, in your case there <i>might</i> exist the
    influence of a charm that has the power to benumb certain
    strings of the heart, the sense of right and wrong. Once more I
    repeat, I do not say this is the case, I repeat, I am not even
    asking if it is so; I only mean it as a hint, and having given
    this hint that there might be a possible danger, I leave it at
    that, and I will not pursue it even in thought. And also I
    think this solicitude on my part may be excused by you and not
    taken amiss if it should be unfounded, which I hope will be the
    case.</p>

    <p>Did you receive my studies? Since then I have made a large
    painted one, and a large sketch of a drawbridge [Lost], and even a
    <art id=1098>second painted one of it with another effect</art>.</p>

    <p>As soon as there is snow, I hope to use them to get the snow
    effect more accurately, that is to say, keeping the same lines
    and structure which I have found now. Well, I hope to hear from
    you soon.</p>

    <p>What influence this or that occurrence, which is not even
    visible on the horizon yet, may have on you is a thing I think
    about extremely little, for, as you see, what I think about is
    yourself as a human being - about the &ldquo;what shall he do
    with it?&rdquo; - about your activity and energy too.</p>

    <p>With a handshake, believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Yesterday I heard that Furn&eacute;e had passed his final
    exam, and now he again has his hands free to go on with his
    painting.</p>

    <p>Though it may not be my first preoccupation, yet I am far
    from indifferent to the reason for <i>almost ten days'</i>
    difference in the receipt of the money.</p>
