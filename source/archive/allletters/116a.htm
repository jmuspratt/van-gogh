  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>With all my heart I wish you a Happy New Year, may it be a
    blessed year for you in many ways. The days when you were here
    were good, but they did not last long. My vacation will soon be
    ended too, but I am going to stay for at least one more day, as
    Pa is so very busy these days, and it will be good to talk
    things over quietly together and discuss how to set about my
    further studies.</p>

    <p>On New Year's Eve Pa will also have to preach in
    Prinsenhage, for the Reverend Mr. Kuylman fell and hurt
    himself, dislocating his arm, and he is unable to fulfill his
    preaching engagement on New Year's eve; and Pa has offered to
    take his place. Thus Pa will be preaching nine times in ten
    days.</p>

    <p>If you have not sent the postcard in question to Harry
    Gladwell yet, please don't for a while; I heard he is not in
    Paris any longer. Today I wrote to his father; perhaps I shall
    get a reply, and then I shall have something to add to the
    roll. You forgot to take the etching after Meissonier with you;
    I shall send it to you one of these days, together with the
    lithograph after Jules Breton, &ldquo;The Fields in
    Winter,&rdquo; for I refuse to accept it, seeing that it is an
    indispensable part of your collection.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">Last week it snowed, and Cor had great fun with the sled -
    and I, too - for I went sledding on the road with him and a
    little girl who was staying with the Stackstroos. Today Father,
    Mother, Cor and I went for a lovely walk; I wish you could have
    been with us. Yesterday I went to see Mother's sewing class,
    which she teaches nowadays in the vestry; it is really lovely -
    one would like to have a painting of it; already quite a number
    of children go to it.</label></p>

    <p>By chance I remembered another painting bearing on Brittany,
    namely Ribot's &ldquo;La Pri&egrave;re&rdquo; - a number of
    children kneeling in the corner of a church at twilight; there
    is also a big etching of it done by the artist himself, which
    you may know. Jacque once etched the same subject, but on a
    smaller scale.</p>

    <p>Today I made a list of everything I can remember concerning
    the French Revolution, to write on the back of the little map
    of France. I hope to extend the work gradually; for instance, I
    might write down the most important things about the Middle
    Ages and the period of the Eighty Years' War, etc. One must
    hold on to what one has seen or what one knows, for it can
    always come in handy. If you make similar lists yourself,
    please send them to me once in a while so we can compare notes;
    it is wise to do this - with knowledge, it is important to hold
    on to what one has and to make it as clear in one's mind as
    possible. Especially when one is short of money, it helps to
    fill up the gaps in this and similar ways.</p>

    <p>Regards to the family, and wish them happiness in my name.
    It may be that on my way to Amsterdam, I shall stop at The
    Hague to bring you the prints you left behind; but don't count
    on it. Again &agrave; Dieu; very best wishes and a warm
    handshake in thought from</p>

    <p>Your so loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Vincent's sisters had written at the bottom]</p>

    <p>My beloved brother,</p>

    <p>A happy New Year, and I wish you lots of good luck. We are
    all quite anxious to hear about the decisions of the
    &ldquo;High Court&rdquo; in the matter of Goupil, and we hope
    they will prove favourable to you in every respect. How nice it
    is to have been together again, but it's a pity the little
    words <i>have been</i> must be used, don't you think? Well, I
    am looking forward to Easter, and I suppose it is the bright
    spot on your horizon, too. What do you say to that preaching?
    Isn't it a shame? The Reverend Mr. Kuylman did not even half
    know what a foolish thing he did, to go and hurt his arm at
    such an inopportune moment. And now adieu. Wil wants some
    space, too, so I am stopping in a hurry.</p>

    <p>Ever your affectionate sister, Lies</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>My warmest wishes for the New Year. Lies tells me to write
    that she wrote &ldquo;my beloved brother&rdquo; <i>by
    accident</i>. We must go to bed now, good night, a pleasant
    day.</p>

    <p>With much love, Wil</p>
