    <p>[The following letter from Vincent van Gogh to Gauguin has a
    Bernard Number here because it appears in the edition of the
    letters to Bernard as number 22]</p>

    <p>My dear Gauguin,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter, and above all thanks for your
    promise to come here as early as the twentieth. Surely the
    reason you mention [not feeling well] will hardly contribute
    towards making your train journey a pleasure trip, and it is
    only right that you should put off your journey until you can
    manage it without trouble. But apart from that I almost envy
    you your journey, which is going to show you miles and miles of
    landscapes in the splendour of autumn.</p>

    <p>There is still present to my mind the emotion by my own
    journey from Paris to Arles last winter. How I peered out to
    see whether it was like Japan yet! Childish, wasn't it?</p>

    <p><label content="health.eyes">Listen, the other day I wrote you that my eyesight was
    strangely tired. All right, I rested for two and a half days,
    and then set to work again, but without daring to go out into
    the open air yet.</label> I have done, still for my decoration,<art id=0482> a size
    30 canvas of my bedroom with the white deal furniture that you
    know</art>. Well, I enormously enjoyed doing this
    interior of nothing at all. Of a simplicity &agrave; la
    Seurat.</p>

    <p><?showImage("684_V-G_B220");?>
    </p>

    <p>With flat tints, but brushed on roughly, with a thick
    impasto, the walls pale lilac, the ground a faded broken red,
    the chairs and the bed chrome yellow, the pillows and the sheet
    a very pale green-citron, the blanket blood red, the washstand
    orange, the washbasin blue, the window green. By means of all
    these very diverse tones I have wanted to express an
    <i>absolute</i> <i>restfulness</i>, you see, and there is no
    white in it at all except a little note produced by the mirror
    with its black frame (in order to get the fourth pair of
    complementaries into it).</p>

    <p>Well, you will se it along with the other things, and we
    will talk about it, for I often don't know what I am doing when
    I am working almost like a sleepwalker.</p>

    <p>It is beginning to turn cold, particularly on the days when
    the mistral blows.</p>

    <p>I have had gas laid on in the studio, so that we shall have
    good light in winter.</p>

    <p>Perhaps Arles will disappoint you, if you come here in
    mistral weather; but you wait &hellip; It is only in the long
    run that the poetry of this place penetrates.</p>

    <p>You will not find the house as comfortable yet as we shall
    gradually try to make it. There are so many expenses! And it
    can't be done all at once. But I believe after all that once
    you are here you will be seized like me with a rage for
    painting the autumnal effects in the intervals between the
    spells of mistral, and that you will understand why I insisted
    on your coming here, now that we are having very fine
    weather.</p>

    <p>Well, we'll se each other.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
