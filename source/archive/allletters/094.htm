  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many happy returns of the day; I hope you will have a good
    time, and great prosperity in the year that is to come. Time
    passes so quickly, the days fly by; still, something must
    remain, and the past is not totally lost. We may become richer
    and firmer of mind, of character, of heart; we may become
    richer in God; we may become richer in the pure gold of life,
    the love for each other, and the feeling &ldquo;I am not alone,
    for the Father is with me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So be it with us all; that prayer of our father's is a good
    one: &ldquo;Unite us closely, O Lord, and let love toward Thee
    strengthen this bond more and more.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I hope to see you soon, for I intend to stop off at The
    Hague before going on to Amsterdam. Don't breathe a word to
    anyone, for my only wish is to be close to you. Next Wednesday
    morning I am leaving for Etten where I intend to spend several
    days; then, I put my hand to the plough.</p>

    <p>I wish you had been here yesterday; in the morning I heard
    the farewell sermon of the Reverend Mr. Hooyer in the French
    church. The church was crowded, and he spoke with fire and
    enthusiasm; the sight of that grave, distinguished congregation
    struck me - the whole had an extremely serious atmosphere. He
    expressed his thanks for the love he had been shown by many,
    particularly during the trying times in the beginning, four
    years ago, when he had to wrestle with the difficulties of
    preaching in the French language; for he is a Dutchman. Several
    of the other preachers were here in the church. Yesterday's
    sermon happened to be on the same words he had preached about
    that first time. &ldquo;Now we look through a mirror into a
    dark reason, now I only know in part, but then shall I know
    even as also I am known myself.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In the afternoon I was in the Great Church to hear the
    reverend Mr. Keller van Hoorn; his text was, &ldquo;Our
    Father.&rdquo; In the evening I heard the Reverend Mr. Greeff,
    whom I also heard the first Sunday night I was here in
    Dordrecht. May the Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord make
    His face to shine upon thee, and give thee peace. The Lord make
    thee pray high prayers and think high thoughts. The Lord be thy
    keeper and the shade upon thy right hand. May He be with thee
    always until the end of the world.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">After church I walked
    along the path behind the station
    where we walked together; my thoughts were full of you, and I
    wished we might be together. </label>I walked on to the churchyard at
    the end of a black cinder track through the meadows --they
    looked so beautiful in the twilight. The churchyard reminds me
    of that drawing by Apol in Eigen Haard;<sup>1</sup> a moat
    surrounds it, and there is a house circled by pine trees - last
    night a light was shining kindly through the windows - it is an
    old house, and looks like a parsonage.</p>

    <p>Much good may be in store for us in the future; let us learn
    to repeat with Father: &ldquo;I never despair,&rdquo; and, with
    Uncle Jan &ldquo;If black is the devil, it is always better to
    look him in the eyes.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Write again soon; next Wednesday I shall be in Etten. Do you
    have De Plancy's L&eacute;gendes des Artistes, with wood
    engravings after Rochussen? I hope to bring it for you. Between
    times I have worked through the whole story of Christ from a
    catechism book of Uncle Stricker's and copied the texts; they
    reminded me of so many pictures by Rembrandt and others. I hope
    and believe I will not repent my choosing to try to become a
    real Christian and a Christian worker. Yes, everything in my
    past experience may contribute to it: through the acquaintance
    of cities like London and Paris and life in schools like those
    at Ramsgate and Isleworth, one is strongly drawn and attached
    to many things and books from the Bible, e.g.. Acts of the
    Apostles. Knowledge of and love for the work and the life of
    such men as Jules Breton, Millet, Jacque, Rembrandt, Bosboom
    and so many others may become a source of new thoughts. What a
    resemblance there is between the work and life of Father and
    that of these men; I value Father's higher still. May God help
    us, boy. A handshake and once more the very best wishes
    from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Kind regards to the Roos family.</p>
