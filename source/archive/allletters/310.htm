  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I was very glad to hear that you are on your way. Thanks for
    your letter and the enclosure.</p>

    <p>I needn't tell you how I long for your coming. <label content="health.general">Recently I
    have been far from well - always the same thing, at times
    palpitations of the heart, too. I am afraid it will eventually
    turn out that the heart is affected.</label> Well, I don't know much
    about it, but I do know that you must not mention it at home,
    or to anybody else, for fear of their getting wrong ideas about
    my circumstances.</p>

    <p>The only thing I want it is to make some good work
    &ldquo;quand bien m&ecirc;me,&rdquo; and there is a chance of
    doing this if we keep our serenity, whether the future is dark
    or not.</p>

    <p>If I knew what train you would be on, I should meet you at
    the station. And in case you came while I was out, the woman
    could tell you where I am, for in order not to miss you, I go
    no farther from home than to be the Binkhorst just across the
    way, to paint a few studies.</p>

    <p>I wonder what you will say about the work, whether you will
    find something in it or not. Well, we shall see.</p>

    <p>All the time I am planning a <art id=009>large picture of the potato
    diggers</art>, though it might not be finished until next year, and
    only half finished this season. I think the composition might
    stay the way it is, and I just might get started.</p>

    <p>I am not competent to ascertain to what extent my illness
    has a physical cause, or if it is only the consequence of
    overstrained nerves. It sometimes seems to me that I ought to
    have seen you between times and discussed the work, but now you
    have come at last, and I am quite sure that at all events our
    being together will calm me down.</p>

    <p>I hope we shall take some nice long walks together, too.</p>

    <p>Did I tell you that at Loosduinen I found thornbushes
    exactly like the &ldquo;Buisson&rdquo; by Ruysdael? I intend to
    make studies for the potato diggers in that neighborhood.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I hope to be all right again soon. I will try as hard as I
    can, for I hate being unable to go on with full vigour. When I
    wrote Rappard that I did not believe my only aim in life could
    be to preserve my health,</label><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition"> I meant that there are circumstances
    when one has to choose between one's work and having nothing to
    eat, or between eating and dropping one's work (namely, when
    the work brings expenses and for the moment yields no
    profit).</label></p>

    <p>In some cases I prefer the former, and do not think I am
    wrong, for our work remains, but we do not, and the main thing
    is to create; I would rather have a few years of that than
    years of brooding over it and putting it off. And I said to
    Rappard then that for my part I thought there was truth in the
    mysterious saying, &ldquo;whosoever will save his life shall
    lose it, but whosoever will lose his life for the Gospel's sake
    shall find it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, I hope to see you soon. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
