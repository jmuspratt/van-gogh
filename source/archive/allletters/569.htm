  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I hope it will not amaze you too much that though I wrote
    you a letter this morning, I add a few lines the same
    evening.</p>

    <p>For there were several days when I could not write, but you
    see clearly that this is over now.</p>

    <p>I have written a note to Mother and Wil and <i>addressed it
    to our sister</i>, with the sole intention of setting their
    minds at rest <label content="health.general">in case you have said anything about my having
    been ill.</p>

    <p>Just tell them on your part that I have been a bit beat, the
    way I used to be in the past, when I had that venereal trouble
    in The Hague, and that I got myself looked after in the
    hospital. Only that it is not worth mentioning since I have
    completely recovered, and that I was only in the aforesaid
    hospital for a few days.</label> In this way your information will
    square with the note which I have made them swallow at home in
    Holland. And by so doing, it will be very difficult for them to
    get into a stew about it. I hope you will think this stratagem
    innocent enough.</p>

    <p>Also you will see by this that I have not yet forgotten how
    to jest once in a while.</p>

    <p>I am going to set to work again tomorrow. I shall begin by
    doing one or two still lifes so as to get back into the habit
    of painting. Roulin has been splendid to me, and I dare say
    that the will remain a lasting friend. I shall have need enough
    of that still, for he knows the country well.</p>

    <p>We had our dinner together today.</p>

    <p>If ever you want to make the house surgeon Rey <i>very
    happy</i>, this is what would please him hugely. He has heard
    of <art id=anatless>a picture by Rembrandt, the &ldquo;Anatomy Lesson.&rdquo;</art> I
    told him that we would get him the engraving after it for his
    study.</p>

    <p>As soon as I feel somewhat up to it, I hope to do his
    portrait. Last Sunday I met another doctor, who knows his
    Delacroix and Puvis de Chavannes at least theoretically, and
    who is very curious about impressionism.</p>

    <p>I think I can hope to become better acquainted with him.</p>

    <p>I think that that engraving of the &ldquo;Anatomy
    Lesson&rdquo; is stocked by Fran&ccedil;ois Buffa &amp; Sons,
    and that the net price should be from 12 to 15 francs. We had
    better have it framed here to save the cost of
    transportation.</p>

    <p>I assure you that some days at the hospital were very
    interesting, and perhaps it is from the sick that one learns
    how to live.</p>

    <p><label content="health.symptoms">I hope I have just had simply an artist's fit, and then a
    lot of fever after <i>very</i> considerable loss of blood, as
    an artery was severed;</label> but <label content="health.gastrointestinal">my appetite came back at once, my
    digestion is all right</label> and my blood recovers from day to day,
    and in the same way serenity returns to my brain day by day. So
    please quite deliberately forget your unhappy journey and my
    illness.</p>

    <p>You see that I am doing what you asked, and writing you what
    I feel and think. On your part follow this meeting with the
    Bongers up quietly. I hope it will continue as a lasting
    friendship, and that perhaps it will be even more.</p>

    <p>If I stay here, it is because for the moment I might not be
    able to transplant myself. After some time we can go over the
    pros and cons of the situation and figure things out again.</p>

    <p>With a good handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
