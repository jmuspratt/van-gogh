    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>As I heard from Father that there is a chance of your being
    in Etten next Sunday, and that it would be well for me to be
    there also, I start thither today.</p>

    <p>So I hope to meet you soon, and am looking forward to it
    very much, particularly because I have sketched two drawings at
    Rappard's, &ldquo;The Lamp Bearers&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
    Bearers of the Burden,&rdquo; and should like to consult you
    about how to go on with them. I must somehow have the necessary
    models to finish them, and then I trust the result will be
    good, that is, I shall have a few compositions to show to
    Smeeton Tilly, or to the editors of L'Illustration or the
    like.</p>

    <p>So I leave today and am letting you know, so that you will
    not look for me in Brussels. I should like to make a few
    sketches of the heaths at Etten, which is why I am starting a
    few days earlier.</p>

    <p>So I hope to meet you soon, and now shake hands with you in
    thought.</p>

    <p>Yours truly, Vincent</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I am sending you three krabbelingen [scrawls] which are
    clumsy as yet, but from which you will see, I hope, that I am
    gradually improving. You should take into account that it is
    only a short time since I started drawing, although I made
    little sketches when I was a boy. And that during this winter I
    thought it most important to make rigidly accurate anatomical
    studies, not my own compositions.</label></p>
