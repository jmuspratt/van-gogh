  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is not yet four o'clock. Last evening there was a
    thunderstorm and it rained during the night. It has stopped
    raining now, but everything is wet and the sky is grey, broken
    here and there by darker or lighter masses of neutral or
    yellowish white clouds which are moving across the sky. Because
    of the early hour the leaves look greyish and subdued in
    colour; along the wet road a farmer in a blue smock is
    approaching on a brown horse he has fetched from the meadow. In
    the background the city is a grey silhouette, also subdued in
    colour; however, the wet red roofs stand out strongly. It looks
    more like a Daubigny than a Corot because of the variety of
    colour in the ground and the green, the vividness of
    everything. I am sure that if you saw it, you would enjoy it as
    much as I. There is nothing more beautiful than nature early in
    the morning.</p>

    <p>Your letter came yesterday and was not a little welcome.
    Many thanks. I was very hard up this time; I was absolutely
    penniless. <label content="health.fatigue">The woman had no milk to nurse the baby those last
    days, and I too felt very faint.</label> As a last effort I went in
    desperation to Tersteeg. I thought, &ldquo;I have nothing to
    lose, perhaps it is a way to bring about a better state of
    affairs.&rdquo; So I went there with a large sketch, about
    which I wrote you in my last letter. It has turned into a row
    of diggers, men and women, with lumps of earth in the
    foreground and a glimpse of some roofs of a little village in
    the background. I told Tersteeg that I understood perfectly
    well this sketch could not be anything for him, but that I came
    to show it to him because it was so long since he had seen any
    of my work and because I for one wanted to prove that I did not
    feel any ill will about what had happened last year. Well, he
    said that he did not hold a grudge, either; as to the drawing,
    he had told me last year that I ought to make watercolours, and
    he did not want to repeat himself by talking about it again.
    Then I told him that I had occasionally tried a watercolour and
    had several in my studio, but that I myself had more heart for
    another kind of drawing and increasingly favored vigorously
    drawn figures.</p>

    <p>Then I told him that I felt guilty about having kept those
    drawing examples of Bargue's all the time, that I would have
    returned them long ago if what had happened last year had not
    prevented me from mentioning it, but that I came to settle that
    question, too. A few of them had been a little damaged by use,
    and as there were a few other things on my account at the time,
    I hoped he would he inclined, either now or later, to take a
    few of my drawings to balance that account, and I hoped he
    would approve of my having come to settle that affair. Well, he
    agreed to this, and I am glad the Bargues are returned now.</p>

    <p>I told him that there were a great many things he had not
    seen in the studio. He said he was glad to see from the drawing
    that I was at least working, and I asked him if there had been
    any reason for him to doubt that I was working. Well, then a
    telegram came for him, and I went away. At all events the
    Bargues are off my mind, and I have thanked him once more for
    having lent them to me at the time, for they have been of great
    use to me. But, after all, I do not even really know whether he
    liked the drawing or not.</p>

    <p>I should not be in the least surprised if he considered it
    crazy work, or absolutely absurd, because he said he would
    rather not have anything to do with it. But even if he does
    find it absurd or crazy, I don't think I should let it upset
    me, or take his opinion as decisive or conclusive.</p>

    <p>I always think it possible that the time will come when
    Tersteeg will have another opinion of me, also of my actions
    now and last year. But I will leave it to time, and if he
    persists in thinking everything I do is wrong, well, I will
    take it in my stride and go my own way as if he did not
    exist.</p>

    <p>For the rest, I will leave things alone, let's say, till you
    come here. I am not sorry I went there after all.</p>

    <p>I was very glad to hear that things are going well with you.
    Have a good time, boy. Relatively speaking, I also have a good
    time, apart from many financial worries - many other worries
    too - but with my work I am in luck: I have been working with
    enormous pleasure lately, and with a firm feeling of
    &ldquo;being on the open road,&rdquo; as Rappard says of
    himself in the letter which I sent you. Yes, boy, one
    perseveres and works on without minding the rest, if one tries
    honestly and freely to fathom nature, and does not lose hold of
    what one has in mind whatever people may say, then one feels
    calm and steady and faces the future quietly. Yes, one may make
    mistakes, one may perhaps exaggerate here or there, but the
    thing one makes will be original. You have read in Rappard's
    letter the words: &ldquo;I used to make things now in this,
    then in that style, without sufficient personality: but these
    last drawings have at least a character of their own, and I
    feel that I have found my way.&rdquo; I feel almost the same
    thing now.</p>

    <p>Some time ago I read a remarkable saying of Taine's (Essay
    on Dickens): &ldquo;Le fonds du charact&egrave;re Anglais c'est
    l'absence du bonheur&rdquo; [the foundation of the English
    character is the absence of happiness]. I do not think that
    saying <i>quite</i> satisfactory and correct: it does not
    explain everything, but still it is remarkably to the point and
    contains much truth.</p>

    <p>A typical English saying is Carlyle's &ldquo;The result of
    an idea must not be a feeling but an <i>action</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>That concept of life which leads a man to concentration -
    not primarily <i>to</i> attain material happiness, but above
    all to concentrate on his work, to do some good - has many
    examples in England, and is perhaps a national characteristic.
    Carlyle also says, &ldquo;Knowest thou that worship of sorrow,
    the temple thereof founded some eighteen hundred years ago, now
    lies in ruins, yet its sacred lamp is still burning.&rdquo;
    When I think of De Groux, for instance, or of what you have
    occasionally told me about Daumier, I find in them something of
    this &ldquo;worship of sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The drawing which I showed Tersteeg showed up very poorly in
    his little room; one must see it surrounded by other drawings:
    then it has quite a different effect. Well, yesterday I worked
    at it all day again to finish the figures better.</p>

    <p>Since I wrote you last, I have made four more large studies
    for the potato digging. Here in the neighborhood they dig the
    potatoes with a short-handled fork, and the digger is kneeling.
    I imagine a fine thing might be made of those kneeling figures
    in a flat country in the evening - something that would have a
    certain sentiment of devotion; therefore I have studied it
    closely, and have already got a man sticking his fork into the
    ground (the first movement); another pulling out the potato
    plant (the second movement); then a <i>woman's</i> figure in
    the same action; and the figure of a third man throwing the
    potatoes into a basket.</p>

    <p>I will start this drawing today or tomorrow, but among the
    men's figures I want one with a bald head.</p>

    <p>For the studies which I have already finished, I had a young
    farm hand, a real type, with something broad and rough and
    <i>non &eacute;barb&eacute;</i>[unpolished] about him.</p>

    <p>Now about these drawings, Theo, I don't think I shall sell
    them. I still remember what Isra&euml;ls said to Van der Weele
    about the latter's large picture: &ldquo;You certainly won't
    sell it, but that must not discourage you, for it will give you
    new friends and enable you to sell other things.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Someday, when I can afford it, I will make on canvas an
    elaborate sketch such as I have now made on paper, and try my
    hand at painting again. But I should have to take great pains
    with the models for it, otherwise it would certainly be a
    failure. I have a few things in mind that will do well painted
    in oil.</p>

    <p>I had no answer from C. M. to my letter, and so I am not in
    a hurry to write again. So you see, Theo, there is very, very
    little chance of my selling anything. It was not pleasant going
    to Tersteeg, I assure you; but I did, thinking, Perhaps -
    perhaps he will be inclined to forgive and forget everything on
    both sides. But it was clear enough that he is not up to that
    yet; I believe it is still as you described it so well at the
    time, &ldquo;sometimes he is aggravated by the way I shake
    hands with him,&rdquo; or one of those little idiosyncrasies
    which make one dislike a person so much that one would rather
    avoid him.</p>

    <p>I am rather hard up. Last year, you remember, every now and
    then I had something extra from you; now for certain reasons
    you have been rather straightened yourself since February or
    March, I think. I do not know how to keep things going; the
    expenses increase beyond my power, though I economize on
    everything, and the woman, too. The money from Rappard helped
    me briefly in buying the materials for those large drawings,
    but the large drawings bring many ex-penses on account of the
    models. Then there are the stretchers and the paper, etc.; and
    besides, I make a lot of small drawings, too. So the days drag
    heavily on, and are hard for the woman and me to get through
    because of the scarcity of everything</p>

    <p>I told Tersteeg that I was very anxious to be on good terms
    with Mauve again, but he did not answer a word. My total
    impression of the visit to Tersteeg is that it would have been
    nicer if he had taken things somewhat lightly, as such a long
    time had passed; but there was a ponderousness in the air, and
    something of, &ldquo;There you are, bothering me again - do
    leave me alone.&rdquo; He did not use those exact words, for he
    spoke very formally, but I think the meaning was quite obvious
    considering what <i>he might have said</i><i>,</i> namely,
    &ldquo;I agree to our making up, and I will come and look at
    your work&rdquo;; or something like it.</p>

    <p>But I may be wrong in this; I will let time pass over it
    again and hope for the best, and see whether it will redress
    itself. I must continue to work hard for the very reason that I
    hope some things will redress themselves and come out
    right.</p>

    <p>The one thing I hope for more than anything else is that
    when you come, you will find that I have made progress and that
    there is some good in my work. From time to time you have
    written me that you found something in it; I don't think you
    were mistaken, or that Tersteeg is right, with his absolute
    indifference which is almost hostile. Yes, that is the very
    first thing which I value: that you who from the very beginning
    have done so much - nay, everything - for my work may continue
    to find some good in it. If I can bring this about, your visit
    would make me forget all the cares of the whole year.</p>

    <p>There is one thing that gives me hope there is some
    character in the big sketch, namely Iterson remarked that
    various things in it &ldquo;annoyed&rdquo; him, and that he
    thought them &ldquo;not so felicitous&rdquo;; I think you can
    imagine Iterson with a bland and sort of wise face, his head
    tilted a little to one side, and speaking his mind sweetly and
    mildly with undulating emphasis. His observations rather amused
    me. Eerelman, the painter, was also present and seemed to be
    more or less in agreement with Iterson, which I thought very
    understandable.</p>

    <p>I think you will agree with me that this may be a step
    toward making it up, even though Tersteeg should be unwilling
    at first. One or the other will have to make an overture, but
    now I am going to wait until I have had a talk with you.</p>

    <p>If Tersteeg saw them, I imagine that among the many figures
    I have drawn there might be some of which he might say,
    &ldquo;I should like to see this or that one in such and such a
    size in watercolour.&rdquo; In such a case I would not refuse
    to try it, not for my own pleasure, but to sell something if
    possible. But these are not the only possibilities, for in the
    future I shall make things quite different from what I have
    made till now. I know from experience how one can have a
    dislike for someone's work, or be indifferent to it, and keep
    that up for a long time; then one day one unexpectedly sees a
    thing of his, thinks it over, and remembers his previous work,
    and says to oneself, &ldquo;Wait a minute, that must be good
    after all.&rdquo; And then one feels an interest, one can't
    forget it - and one has learned to like it.</p>

    <p>I felt this, especially with English drawings: at first I
    didn't like them at all, and just like most people here,
    thought that the English were actually quite wrong; but that
    did not last, and I have learned to look at things from a
    different angle.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I sometimes long to do? To make a trip to
    Brabant. I should love to draw the old churchyard at Nuenen,
    and the weavers.</p>

    <p>To make, let's say, studies of Brabant for a month, and to
    come back with a lot of them for a large drawing of a peasant
    funeral, for instance.</p>

    <p>Before I finish this letter, I repeat that, when you write
    in your last letter that you are having a good time, I can say
    the same to you; I have a great serenity and good spirits in
    regard to the work, and I have so much to do that it quite
    absorbs me. But the money is the damnedest thing, I have more
    expenses than I can cover.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I was thinking of recently? Of that book on
    Gavarni that you have. I remember from it how Gavarni's
    drawings of London drunkards and beggars, etc., according to
    his own saying, only turned out well after he had lived there
    for some time, I think after a year, and in a letter he wrote
    of how it takes time to feel at home in new surroundings.</p>

    <p>Well, I am starting to feel quite at home here now compared
    to the beginning, and I now find what I made here at first very
    superficial. And the very hope of expressing myself more and
    more strongly and more elaborately makes the present time seem
    good to me, for there is no lack of subjects or models
    (provided I can pay them). I am full of ideas and plans, and so
    the cares aren't overwhelming me yet.</p>

    <p>But things must be paid for, and everything costs money, and
    the obstructions make it like cutting one's way through a hedge
    of thorns. It is a fact that I ought to take more models but
    can't; I try my utmost, and, so to speak, more than my utmost,
    to pay the expenses for it, but the household costs money too,
    and I can't make both ends meet. Qu'y faire?</p>

    <p>Do you remember, perhaps from your time at The Hague,
    persons to whom I could show my work? I myself do not, except
    one, and that is Lantsheer, but he wants things to be very,
    very good, and for the very reason that I hope to sell him
    something <i>later on</i>, I should not like to show him
    anything now. Lantsheer is an uncle or some such relation of
    Rappard's. Rappard wrote me once that he had shown him a little
    sketch of mine, and that L. had liked it.</p>

    <p>If someday I should have something which I thought suitable
    for him, I could contact him through Rappard. I do not like to
    go and see people to show them my work; if it were somebody
    else's work, I shouldn't mind it, but now it is my own. Adieu,
    with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I am almost sure that someday, when Rappard has seen the
    large drawings, he will speak to Lantsheer about me, even
    without my asking it.</p>
