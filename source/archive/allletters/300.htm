  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I want to chat with you before going to Scheveningen. I have
    gained my point with De Bock and have my pied-&agrave;-terre at
    his home; perhaps I shall also go to Blommers's occasionally.
    Now I intend to work principally in Scheveningen for some time,
    to go there early in the morning and stay there all day, or, if
    I must be at home, to be there at noon when it is too hot, and
    go back again in the evening. I trust this will give me new
    ideas and rest, not through idleness but through a change of
    surroundings and occupation.</p>

    <p>For the rest, I am up to my ears in work. Today the
    almshouse man again posed for a thing that I suddenly felt I
    had to make before I started anything else. I must tell you
    that I went to the almshouse again on a visiting day after all.
    Then I saw the little old gardener, and have drawn him from the
    window.</p>

    <p>Well, I could not let that go, and I have got as much of it
    fixed on paper as I can remember.</p>

    <p><?showImage("356_V-T_3000");?>
    </p>

    <p>Last evening I received a present which pleased me
    enormously (from those two land surveyors - for there has been
    a second one since), namely a very characteristic Scheveningen
    jacket with high turn-up collar, picturesque, faded and
    patched.</p>

    <p>I arranged my painting materials as far as I could, added
    what was necessary and laid up a stock of streetcar tickets,
    etc.</p>

    <p>This morning I saw the negatives of the three photographs. I
    long to see the prints and I hope that in this small size they
    will be useful when we approach the illustrated press. I think
    I will also have a photo taken of today's drawing of that
    little gardener, for that figure is much, much more elaborate
    than in this scratch, and the surroundings are much less tame
    than they are here. I hope to be able to send you the prints of
    the photographs next week.</p>

    <p>But, boy, I must ask you to try your utmost to send me some
    money; I am already penniless because of those expenses that
    were absolutely necessary for starting work in
    Scheveningen.</p>

    <p>It needn't be much, but a little to get through the days and
    not to sit in the dunes without a penny to bless myself
    with.</p>

    <p>The photographs are <art id=1035>&ldquo;Sower,&rdquo;</art><art id=1034> &ldquo;Potato
    Diggers,&rdquo;</art> and <art id=1031>&rdquo;Peat Cutters&rdquo;;</art> I think the
    last one is the best.</p>

    <p>Don't you think it nice of those land surveyors? They are
    jolly, merry fellows, who have often been good company to me.
    They are really beginning to make nice sketches, but both have
    to take their final exams - one, for land surveyor, and the
    other, for civil engineer.</p>

    <p>As soon as I have looked around Scheveningen a little, I
    shall take the woman with me occasionally, to pose or at least
    to indicate the place and the size of the figures.</p>

    <p>I long so much for your coming, boy, I hope there will be a
    few things in my work which you will like, and that you will
    see some progress. De Bock saw some of last year's painted
    studies and liked them, but they please me less and less. I
    hope to make better ones this year.</p>

    <p>The photographer will come to the studio next Sunday. I want
    to discuss with him which of the figures I have are most
    suitable for photographing. I should be at a complete loss if
    you absolutely could not send anything extra. I bought only the
    things strictly necessary for the paintbox, but hardly anything
    is left.</p>

    <p>The Scheveningen jacket is a piece of good luck.</p>

    <p>Some time ago I wrote you that perhaps it would be the same
    with me now as it was when I lived in The Hague years ago, that
    at first it was a miserable time but that later it became more
    pleasant; and now it has become better and more pleasant again.
    Now, adieu. Do what you can, and believe me, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
