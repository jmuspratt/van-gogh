  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>This morning I received your letter; in many respects the
    contents do not surprise me. It does surprise me a little that
    you should credit me with the slightest insight into business,
    as I am considered a dreamer in that respect, as you know, and
    I could not suppose that you thought differently about it.<label content="Theo.work"> I
    think your idea of changing your situation is a very rational
    one.</label> In the first place, one is not obliged to wait for the
    moment when the employers will arrive at a better insight; and
    in the second place, if one considered oneself obliged to do
    so, one might go on waiting forever and ever, and a young
    employee might doubt whether, when that moment came, he would
    not be too tired to redress things; how much more would this be
    the case with the old &ldquo;pochards pleins&rdquo; themselves.
    The latter will have lost their wits entirely by then; and
    decadence being decadence, a deserved ruin of a business will
    follow, the fatal consequence of certain mistakes. I don't mean
    to say it is if it happens through thoughtlessness, but if it
    happens through that odious, wanton, capricious, reckless way
    of outliving one's fame, and through supposing that everything
    is only a question of money, and that anything is allowed; it
    may succeed many a time, but the end is a breakdown, and such a
    managing director is the only man who gets off safely for the
    moment.</p>

    <p>Well - it's the old, old story - but of course all those
    departments, officious as well as official, all that
    bookkeeping, it's all nonsense, and <i>that's</i> not the way
    to do business. Doing business is surely also
    <i>action</i>, a measure of personal insight and energy.
    That does not count now - that is handicapped - thence your
    com-plaint, There are not enough pictures.</p>

    <p>Suffit, in my opinion the house of G. &amp; Co. is going in
    for gambling now, and who sows the wind shall reap the
    whirlwind. I - who was with them for six years - though I was
    one of the lowest employees - even now after at least ten
    years, I still feel that part of my heart is in it. I think it
    very, very sad. In Uncle Vincent's time they started with a few
    employees who were not treated nearly so arrogantly and as if
    they were machines. Then there was real cooperation, then one
    <i>could</i> be in it with all one's heart. Since then the
    number of employees has increased, but has consisted less and
    less of persons who really put their hearts into the business
    and whose knowledge is sound.</p>

    <p>I myself witnessed some curious instances of this. In the
    meantime the gentlemen became more and more haughty, and I am
    of the opinion that now they are absolutely blind to reality.
    And if I may express my thoughts frankly, I believe that the
    best thing that could happen to them would be that their
    business go to the dogs. In their disenchantment, although they
    would be too old to redress things, it might be possible for
    them to be redressed themselves as human beings.</p>

    <p>I note with pleasure that you don't mention the gentlemen
    personally; that is right - indeed, I didn't expect anything
    else from you. But for the rest, for you yourself it is indeed
    curiously difficult. Your heart is in it, and you are more
    faithful to them than any of the others. I think you would
    rather stay on if possible, even in case another situation were
    more advantageous, because the house is what it is. All that is
    counted for nothing, at least it seems so; though for instance
    old Mr. Goupil felt a certain affection for you, he would
    probably say nothing about it, because they themselves keep
    silent, and let things accumulate quietly.</p>

    <p>Now from your letter I see that the situation in which you
    are placed at the moment is pretty well untenable. Perhaps it
    would be a good thing if, for instance, you went to see old Mr.
    Goupil privately, and told him that you had kept silent as long
    as you could, but that now you cannot wait any longer, so that
    you feel obliged to ask what the gentlemen really want, because
    if it goes on like this, you will no longer be a party to it.
    Something like this - for which you will hardly find an
    opportunity - there will hardly be a question of that - I
    realize that - but something to the effect that you might
    accept an equally good situation, not nearly so well-paid at
    first and still to be created, instead of your present one -
    which, as I see it, might act as an eye opener. I do not think
    that anything of the sort would lead to results or to an
    amelioration of things, but, whatever might happen, old Mr.
    Goupil would trust you, and there is the possibility that in
    any case you might still be of service to him.</p>

    <p>But I must not lose myself in situations which I can only
    estimate quite in general, and now speak about what you say
    further about a project of your own. Under the circumstances -
    always taking the necessity of a change for granted - excellent
    - a modern business, in which energy might achieve something -
    where one is not hampered by so much routine and so complicated
    an administration that everything, absolutely everything is
    paralyzed by it. You tell me there is capital: there is (and
    this means more than capital) a good apparatus for
    reproductions - and if in addition the directors of this
    concern are people who mean well, and who intend to sell good
    things, quand m&ecirc;me to seek their success in honesty,
    then, as I said, it is excellent. But Wisselingh at Collier's
    collided too violently with his employer's character (although
    <i>he</i> never told me or anybody else so, but I have drawn
    this conclusion independently, which tallies with Wisselingh's
    saying, &ldquo;I wasted my time at Collier's&rdquo;). And I am
    disposed to think that the latter's character is the kind that
    will <i>talk</i> grandly rather than <i>act</i> grandly, so I
    say: Are <i>those</i> people at the head of the other concern
    <i>willing?</i></p>

    <p>The <i>being able</i> is rather more the result of these two
    items than people are ready to admit in most cases. After all,
    one should know one's own mind.</p>

    <p>Now I come to what you write about myself.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">Of course I should very much like to spend some time in
    Paris, because I think I should find there that intercourse
    with artists which I shall need someday or other.</p>

    <p>Is that possible? It would be if it did not get you into too
    much trouble. I should like it well enough.</label></p>

    <p>I should love to talk with you about what you wrote, but
    what would be the use? It is better to lend a helping hand when
    there is a chance. &ldquo;N'importe comment.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>For I think that it would greatly help me in my work if I
    had an opportunity to see more of printing, for instance. I
    have had some years' practice in painting now, so I stick to
    that. But if I could get some work in a printer's office or
    something, that would be a help rather than a hindrance - but I
    should have to learn all that. I think, however, I should be
    able to draw reproductions myself, for instance. And I am
    willing to try my hand at <i>anything</i> of that kind,
    especially if a living may be earned in that way over there.
    Indeed, I believe that the time will come when I will not have
    to earn a living in any other way than by painting; but be sure
    that I shall not have the slightest objection to going to
    Paris, whenever you think it would be useful or necessary for
    some reason or other.</p>

    <p><i>My</i> advising <i>you</i> in business matters would
    hardly be the thing. I have been out of it too long, but if I
    came into it again, we would be of the same opinion in a great
    many things. And I do know I have seen what I have seen, and in
    matters of reproduction or publication I daresay I know what is
    good. And I am willing to lend a helping hand as to carrying
    things out, no matter in what way.</p>

    <p>But I need not tell you that here on this beautiful moor I
    haven't the slightest longing for Paris, and I wouldn't think
    about it at all if it hadn't been for your letter. And I simply
    say this, If it must be, all right, I shall go to Paris; if it
    must be, all right, I shall stay on the moors.</p>

    <p>I shall find things to paint everywhere. It is splendid
    here, and I think I learn to paint somewhat better while
    painting. And my <i>heart is in it</i>, I need not tell
    you that.</p>

    <p>Besides, I believe that knowing a handicraft is the most
    solid profession after all, one reason more for me to stick to
    it.</p>

    <p>But if it might happen for some reason or other - on account
    of its being more convenient to you, or because of urgent
    necessity - that we should be together in Paris - I dare
    predict that I shall tell you, start drawing, and I would give
    you a few hints in the beginning.</p>

    <p>I know how much I still have to learn myself, yet I begin to
    see light, and in some way or other, by practice or by learning
    from others what can be of use to me, I will stick to my
    painting with all my heart. And if it might be that you came to
    a point where you saw <i>light</i>, well, so much the
    better.</p>

    <p>You say your heart is in the art business, all right, but
    even more in art itself, I believe.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, write soon again - if you kept silent about it
    now, I should imagine all kinds of worries. So if something is
    the matter, write that; if nothing is the matter, write that;
    but don't keep it all to yourself, for that's not worth
    while.</p>

    <p>Oh, I have had a letter from the poor woman; she was glad
    that I wrote her, but she is worried about the children, and
    she goes out working as a charwoman. She is obliged to live
    with her mother. Poor things.</p>

    <p>But we must keep courage notwithstanding everything.</p>

    <p>I enclose a few scratches from here. The country is so
    beautiful that I cannot describe it. <i>As soon as</i> I can
    paint a little better - then! You can arrange things for me
    exactly as you think best, I shall learn here, and I should
    learn out there, too, I think</p>

    <p>However things may go, I don't suppose it will make you more
    unhappy, and perhaps you have already put up with things too
    long. The best thing would be, if it turned out so, that you
    were more appreciated by your directors, and that they left you
    more liberty to do business as you think best. But I should be
    surprised if things took this turn seeing that Uncle Vincent
    himself was not treated very fairly when he left.</p>

    <p>But leaving that out of it, it seems to me that the whole
    art business is rotten - to tell you the truth, I doubt if the
    present enormous prices, even for masterpieces, will last. A
    &ldquo;je ne sais quoi&rdquo; has passed over it which has
    chilled everything - and enthusiasm has been put to flight. Is
    this of great influence on the artists? Not at all, for
    generally the greatest of them personally profited but little
    from those enormous prices, except in their last period, when
    they were already famous, and they - Millet and others,
    particularly Corot - would not have painted less, or less
    beautifully, without that enormous rise. And whatever may be
    said of art business, for the present it will remain so that he
    who can make a thing worth seeing will always find certain
    persons interested in it, who will make it possible for him to
    earn a living.</p>

    <p>I would rather have 150 francs a month as a painter than
    1500 francs a month in another position, even as an art
    dealer.</p>

    <p>I think one feels more a man among other men as a painter,
    than in a life which is founded on speculation, and in which
    one has to heed conventions. I wonder how it will all turn out,
    but it is all the same to me, one way or another.</p>

    <p>And as to you, I don't consider it would be such bad luck if
    the consequences were that you became a painter in your
    thirtieth year. I should consider it great good fortune. One's
    real life begins at thirty, in fact, that is to say, its most
    active part.</p>

    <p>Friends and family may consider you old, or I don't know
    what, but you can feel a renewal of energy for all that.</p>

    <p>But then it is necessary to reflect well, and to have a
    will, and to be wide-awake. But in that period, a change is
    really necessary; one must wipe out the whole thing and start
    anew. <i>Just as one does when a boy</i> - but more maturely.
    Tom, Dick and Harry, who drowse away in the same old way, think
    this foolish, and say they don't see any good in it; all right,
    leave Tom, Dick and Harry alone, as long as they don't attack
    you; they are as little awake as a somnambulist. For oneself
    one must not doubt that it is the way of nature, and that one
    works against nature only by <i>not</i> changing. There is an
    old saying, They have ears but they hear not, they have eyes
    but they see not, they have a heart but feel not; their heart
    is hardened, and they have closed their ears and eyes because
    they <i>do not want to hear and do not want to see</i>.
    I think that in any case you and I are honest enough so that we
    need not be afraid to open our eyes and look at things as they
    are and as they occur. That little old saying means so much,
    expresses it all so exactly, that I cannot help thinking of it
    again and again.</p>

    <p>This is people gathering peat eating together behind a mound
    of peat, with a little fire in the foreground.</p>

    <p>This painting was of <art id=021>peat loaders</art>, but I fear the scratches
    are absolutely indecipherable.</p>

    <p><?showImage("390_V-T_3350");?>
    </p>

    <p><?showImage("390_V-T_3351");?>
     Here are a couple of evening effects; I am still working on
    that <art id=020>weed burner</art>, which is better than before in a painted
    study, so that it renders more strongly the
    immensity of the plain and the gathering twilight, the fire
    with a bit of smoke being the only spot of light. I went again
    and again to look at it in the evening, and I found <art id=1097>this
    cottage on a muddy evening after the rain</art>; seen on the spot, it
    is splendid.</p>

    <p>I repeat, I think that there are things for me to learn in
    Paris as well as here on the moor; in the city, I should have
    an opportunity to learn from other people and to see what they
    are doing, and that is worth something; but working here, I
    think I can make progress even without seeing other painters.
    And for my own pleasure I would much rather stay here. But if a
    change in your position made it desirable for me to go to you,
    perhaps to earn something in the same business, it is all
    right, and I haven't the slightest objection.</p>

    <p>Be sure to write me about all these things, which of course
    I shall not mention to anybody else.<label content="business.selling"> If my affairs might change
    somewhat for the better, if I could count on C. M.'s buying my
    studies for instance, then the best thing for me would be to
    stay here, as it is cheaper here; </label>and after I had made some
    more progress, and if you decided to become a painter, it would
    be an excellent place for study here - excellent.</p>

    <p>Has C. M. been to see you already? Once more, keep good
    courage, I will try to do the same; and if you ever decide to
    become a painter, do so with inner cheerfulness and all
    possible optimism. Then, taking a broad view of things, you
    would have to consider the time between now and your thirtieth
    year as a rather hard experimental time; but at the end of it
    you would find all things renewed, and a rich future before
    you. Think of what you told me when those Swedish painters were
    in Paris; one must have pluck, the more so because one sees how
    shaky and tottering everything is. &ldquo;Efforts de perdu, que
    soit&rdquo; [efforts of lost souls, so be it] - but they are
    our duty in the times which we live in, and very often one has
    to choose between that and dreaming one's life away.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, good luck, write again soon, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
