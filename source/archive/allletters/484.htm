    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am writing you a second time today because when I tried to
    settle my bill at the hotel I stay at, I had still another
    proof of how I've been swindled.</p>

    <p>I suggested coming to an agreement, they wouldn't hear of
    it, and when I wanted to take away my things, they would not
    let me.</p>

    <p>And that was that, but I told them that I would have it out
    with them before the magistrate: but perhaps the judgement will
    go against me. Only now, you see, in case it goes against me I
    must keep enough to pay 67.40 Fr. instead of the 40 which I owe
    them. So you see I dare not buy my mattress and must go and
    sleep in some other hotel. But I would like to ask you to let
    me have enough to buy my mattress all the same.</p>

    <p>What often worries me here is that it is more expensive than
    I had calculated, and that I cannot manage to get along on the
    same money as Bernard and Gauguin do in Brittany. But all the
    same, now that I am feeling better, I won't give in; and
    besides, if I had had the health I hope to recover here, this
    and lots of other things would not have happened to me. The
    case would have been on its way already if I had not been
    bothered all day.</p>

    <p>I keep thinking that you have got nothing out of my work yet
    and that I have already spent such a lot of money.</p>

    <p>I am sending you in the case all the studies I have except a
    few that I have destroyed, but I am not signing them all; there
    are a dozen that I have taken off the stretchers and 14 on
    stretchers.</p>

    <p>There is <art id=0407>a little landscape with a hovel, white, red, and
    green, and a cypress beside it</art>; you have <art id=1499>the
    drawing of it</art>, and I did the whole painting
    of it in the house. This will show you that, if you like, I can
    make little pictures like the Japanese prints of all these
    drawings. But we can talk about that when you have seen
    them.</p>

    <p>At the moment it is a nuisance that I am practically
    compelled to take the step of staying at the studio, but in the
    end it will mean greater quiet for my work.</p>

    <p>Now that the first studies are gone, I'm beginning another
    series.</p>

    <p>I explained all this business to you in the letters that are
    still in Paris.</p>

    <p>It had been my intention to stay with these people until I
    was ready. But it doesn't matter.</p>

    <p>I want to get my case forwarded today.</p>

    <p>I hope you will write soon.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
