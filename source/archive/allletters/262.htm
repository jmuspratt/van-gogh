  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>The more I think of it, the deeper the impression your last
    letter made on me.</p>

    <p>Generally speaking (apart from the difference between the
    two persons in question), to you and me there appeared on the
    cold cruel pavement a sad pitiful woman's figure, and neither
    you nor I passed it by - we both stopped and followed the human
    impulse of our hearts.</p>

    <p>Such an encounter has the quality of an apparition about it,
    at least when one recalls it; one sees a pale face, a sorrowful
    look like an Ecce Homo on a dark background - all the rest
    disappears. That is the sentiment of an Ecce Homo, and there is
    the same expression in reality, but in this case it is on a
    woman's face. Later it certainly becomes different - but one
    never forgets that first expression-</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">I think it probable that your meeting this woman will take
    your thoughts back to the period some ten or even twenty years
    ago, and even further back.</label></p>

    <p>Anyway, what I mean is that you will rediscover in her, a
    phase of your own life you had nearly forgotten - that is to
    say, the past - and I do not know whether, after having been
    with her for a year, you will view the present with the same
    eyes as, for instance, before you knew her.</p>

    <p>Underneath a figure of an English woman (by Paterson) is
    written the name Dolorosa; that expresses it well.</p>

    <p>I was thinking of the two women now, and at the same time I
    thought of a drawing by Pinwell, &ldquo;The Sisters,&rdquo; in
    which I find that Dolorosa expression. -That drawing represents
    two women in black, in a dark room; one has just come home and
    is hanging her coat on the rack. The other is smelling a
    primrose on the table while picking up some white sewing.</p>

    <p>That Pinwell reminds one a little of Feyen-Perrin - in his
    early work; it also reminds one of Thijs Maris, but with an
    even purer sentiment.</p>

    <p>He was such a poet that he saw the sublime in the most
    ordinary, commonplace things. His work is rare - I saw very
    little of it, but that little was so beautiful that now, at
    least ten years later, I see it as clearly as I did the first
    time.</p>

    <p>At the time they used to say of that club of draughtsmen,
    &ldquo;It is too good to last.&rdquo; Alas, Herkomer's words
    show that it was true; but it is not dead yet, and in
    literature as well as in art, it will be difficult to find a
    better conception of that time than theirs.</p>

    <p>I often disliked many things in England, but that Black and
    White and Dickens are things which make up for it all. I speak
    from my own experience. It's not that I disapprove of
    everything in the present, far from it, but still it seems to
    me that something of the fine spirit of that time which ought
    to have been preserved is disappearing - in art especially. But
    also in life itself. Perhaps I express myself too vaguely, but
    I cannot say it differently - I don't know exactly what it is,
    but it is not just the Black and White which changed its course
    and deviated from its healthy, noble beginning. Rather, there
    is in general a kind of skepticism and indifference and
    coolness, notwithstanding all the activity. But all this is too
    vague, too indefinite. I do not think too much about it,
    because I think of my drawings and have no time to spare.</p>

    <p>I am still busy making heads this week, especially women's
    heads and women with bags, among other things.</p>

    <p>Did you ever see anything by Boyd Houghton - he is one of
    the Graphic's early contributors who, though little known,
    nevertheless has his own niche (he died young)? I thought of
    him once when you wrote about Daumier's
    &ldquo;Barricade.&rdquo; At the time be drew the Parisian
    p&eacute;troleuses and barricades too, but later he went to
    America, and I know drawings of his of Quakers, and a Mormon
    church and Indian women, etc., and immigrants.</p>

    <p>In such a barricade scene, for instance, he had something
    ghostly, or rather mysterious, like Goya. He also treated the
    American subjects in that same way, quite Goya-like; but then
    all at once there are some with a wonderful soberness which
    reminds one of M&eacute;ryon. His wood engravings might almost
    pass for etchings.</p>

    <p>The world says, &ldquo;<i>Too good to
    last</i>,&rdquo; but for that very reason, because it is
    rare, the <i>good lasts</i>. It is not produced every
    day, it will never be achieved mechanically, but what is, is;
    it is not lost, but lasts. And if another good thing turns up
    later on, the first retains its value so I think one must not
    regret that such and such doesn't become more common; even
    though they are uncommon, the good and beautiful things that
    exist remain.</p>

    <p>What about the etchings which Cadart started at that time?
    Did they also prove to be something &ldquo;too good to
    last&rdquo;?</p>

    <p>I know quite well that many beautiful etchings are published
    nowadays. But I mean the old series,
    &ldquo;soci&eacute;t&eacute; des aquafortistes&rdquo; [etchers'
    club], in which appeared &ldquo;Les Deux Freres&rdquo; by
    Feyen-Perrin and the &ldquo;Park &agrave; Moutons&rdquo; by Daubigny
    and work by Bracquemond and so many others - did they keep
    their full power or did they slacken?</p>

    <p>Then if they slackened, aren't the things they did important
    enough to endure forever, so that the expression &ldquo;too
    good to last&rdquo; loses its meaning? Daubigny, Millet,
    Feyen-Perrin, so many others, showed what the etching needle
    can do, just as the <i>Graphic,</i> etc., showed what black and
    white can do.</p>

    <p>And this is a lasting truth, which can give energy to
    whomever wants it.</p>

    <p>The truth is that whenever different people love the same
    thing and work at it together, their union makes strength;
    combined, they can do more than if their separate energies were
    each striving in a different direction. By working together one
    becomes stronger and a whole is formed, though the personality
    of each need not be blotted out by working together. And
    therefore I wish that Rappard were entirely better; we do not
    really work together, but we have the same thoughts about many
    things. He is recovering, though, and we are already fussing
    over our wood engravings again.</p>

    <p>But it is my constant hope that we shall become even better
    friends than we are now, and that perhaps later we shall go and
    visit the miners together, for instance. But for the moment, I
    think we must both apply ourselves to a thorough study of the
    figure; the better we master that, the easier it will become to
    carry out such plans. He writes that he had a fever, that's
    all, that he is still very weak; but he writes little about his
    illness.</p>

    <p>We've had snow again, which is thawing just now. That thaw
    weather is very beautiful. Today, while the snow is melting,
    one feels spring approaching, as it were, from afar.</p>

    <p>I think when you come, sooner or later, we'll have a really
    good time together. I long for the spring breezes to blow away
    the weariness from working indoors so long.</p>

    <p>I am very glad to have <art id=1013>my sou'wester;</art> I wonder if you will
    find some good in <art id=1010>those fishermen's heads.</art> The last one I made
    this week was of <art id=1017>a fellow with white throat whiskers</art>.</p>

    <p>I know a drawing by Boyd Houghton which he calls &ldquo;My
    Models&rdquo;; it represents a passage where a few invalids,
    one with crutches, a blind man, a street urchin, etc., come to
    visit the painter on Christmas Day.</p>

    <p>There is something very pleasant in the intercourse with the
    models, one learns much from them. This winter I have had some
    people whom I shall not easily forget. It is a charming saying
    of Edouard Fr&egrave;re's that he kept the same models so long
    that &ldquo;celles qui posaient dans le temps pour les
    b&eacute;b&eacute;s, posent maintenant pour les
    m&egrave;res&rdquo; [those who used to pose for the babies, are
    now posing for the mothers].</p>

    <p>Well, adieu, Theo, write soon, my best wishes, believe me,
    with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
