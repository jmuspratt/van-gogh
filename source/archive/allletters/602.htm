  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I have been feeling better since I wrote you, and though I
    do not know if it will last, </label>I do not want to wait any longer
    before writing you again.</p>

    <p>Thank you once more for the lovely etching after Rembrandt.
    I would very much like to know the picture and to know in which
    period of his life he painted it. All this goes - along with
    the &ldquo;Portrait of Fabritius&rdquo; in Rotterdam, the
    &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; of the Lacaze Gallery - into a special
    category in which the portrait of a human being is transformed
    into something luminous and comforting.</p>

    <p>And how different this is from Michelangelo or Giotto,
    though the latter nevertheless comes near it and thus Giotto
    forms as it were a possible link between the school of
    Rembrandt and the Italians.</p>

    <p>[<art id=763_V-T_6020>A sketch of Enclosed Field with Ploughman was drawn here.</art>]</p>

    <p>Yesterday I began to work a little again - on a thing that I
    see from my window - <art id=0625>a field of yellow stubble that they are
    ploughing, the contrast of the violet-tinted ploughed earth
    with the strips of yellow stubble, background of hills</art>.</p>

    <p>Work distracts me infinitely better than anything else, and
    if I could once really throw myself into it with all my energy
    possibly that would be the best remedy.</p>

    <p>The impossibility of getting models, however, and a lot of
    other things prevent me from doing it.</p>

    <p>Altogether I really must try to take things a little
    passively and have patience.</p>

    <p>I think very often of the other fellows in Brittany, who are
    certainly busy doing better work than I. If it were possible
    for me to start again with the experience I have now, I should
    not go to see the South. Were I free and independent, I should
    nevertheless have kept my enthusiasm, because there are some
    beautiful things to be done.</p>

    <p>The vineyards, for instance, and the fields of olives.
    <i>If</i> I had confidence in the management of this place,
    nothing would be better or simpler than to bring all my
    furniture here to the hospital and go quietly on.</p>

    <p>If I get better, or in the intervals, I could sooner or
    later go back to Paris or to Brittany for a time.</p>

    <p>But first of all it is <i>very expensive</i> here, and then
    just now I am afraid of the other patients. Altogether lots of
    things make me feel that I haven't had any luck here
    either.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">Perhaps I exaggerate in the misery of my having been bowled
    over by my illness again - but I am sort of afraid.</p>

    <p>You will say - as I say to myself too - that the fault must
    be within me and not in the circumstances or in other people.
    Anyway, it is not pleasant.</label></p>

    <p>M. Peyron has been kind to me and he has much experience. I
    do not doubt that he speaks and judges correctly.</p>

    <p>But has he come to any conclusion - has he written you
    anything definite? And possible?</p>

    <p>You see that I am in a very bad humour, things aren't going
    well. Then I feel like a fool going and asking doctors
    permission to make pictures. Besides, it is to be hoped that if
    sooner or later I get a certain amount better, it will be
    because I have recovered through working, for it is a thing
    which strengthens the will and consequently leaves these mental
    weaknesses less hold.</p>

    <p>My dear brother, I wanted to write better than this, but
    things aren't going very well. I get great pleasure from going
    into the mountains to paint the whole day. I hope they will let
    me do it one of these days.</p>

    <p>You will soon see <art id=0622>a canvas of a hovel in the mountains,
    which I did under the influence of that book of Rod's</art>. It would be good for me to stay
    at a farm, for a time at least; I might do good work there.</p>

    <p>I must write to Mother and Wil one of these days.</p>

    <p>What do you say to Mother's going to live in Leyden? I think
    she is right in that I understand how she hankers after her
    grandchildren. And then there will be hardly any of us left in
    Brabant.</p>

    <p>Speaking of that - not very long ago - I read in Arles I
    forget which book by Henri Conscience. His peasants are
    dreadfully sentimental if you like, but speaking of
    <i>impressionism</i>, do you know that there are descriptions
    of landscapes in it with notes of colour, of a truth, an
    experience, and a primitiveness of the first rank? And it is
    always like that. Oh, my dear brother, that heath down there in
    the Campine was something after all. But there, it will not
    come again, so let's go on.</p>

    <p>He - Conscience - described a brand-new little house with a
    roof of red tiles full in the sunshine, a garden with dock and
    onions, potatoes with their dull green, a beech hedge, a
    vineyard and farther on some pines, the heather all yellow.
    Don't be afraid, it was not a Cazine, it was a Claude Monet.
    Then there is some originality even in the excess of
    sentimentality. And I who feel that and can do nothing, isn't
    it maddening?</p>

    <p>If you happen to have an opportunity to get lithographs
    after Delacroix, Rousseau, Diaz, etc., past or present artists,
    Gal&eacute;ries Modernes, etc., I cannot advise you too
    strongly to hold on to them because you'll see, they will
    become rare. It was, however, just the way to make fine things
    popular, those old prints at 1 franc, those etchings, etc., of
    those days.</p>

    <p>The pamphlet on Rodin and Claude Monet, very interesting;
    I'd have liked to see that. It's no use saying that
    nevertheless I don't agree with him when he says that
    Meissonier is no good, and that the Rousseaus are of great
    interest for those who like them and want to know what the
    artist was feeling. It's impossible that everyone should be of
    this opinion, because for that one must have seen and looked at
    them, and that is not as common as blackberries. Now if you
    looked at a Meissonier for a year, there would still be
    something in it to look at next year, you may be sure of that.
    Not to mention his lucky days, when he had perfect flashes of
    genius. Certainly I know that Daumier, Millet and Delacroix
    have a <i>different</i> style of drawing - but Meissonier's
    workmanship, that something essentially French, above all when
    the old Dutchmen would have found nothing to quarrel with in
    it, and yet it is different from them, and modern; one must be
    blind to think that Meissonier is not an artist and - a
    first-rate one.</p>

    <p>Have many things been done which give the nineteenth-century
    note better than the portrait of Hetzel? When Bernard did those
    two fine panels, primitive man and modern man, which we saw at
    Petit's, when he made the modern man a reader, he had the same
    idea.</p>

    <p>And I shall always regret that in our day people believe
    that the generation of say `48 and the present one are
    incompatible. I think that the two nevertheless belong to each
    other, though I cannot prove it. See, take old Bodmer. Wasn't
    he able to study nature as a hunter and as a woodsman, didn't
    he love it and know it from the experience of a long life,
    virile and complete - and do you think that any chance Parisian
    who goes to the suburbs knows as much or more about it because
    he does a landscape in cruder tones? Not that there is any harm
    in using pure and jarring tones, not that I am <i>always</i> an
    admirer of Bodmer <i>from the point of view of
    colour</i>, but I admire and love the man who knew the
    whole forest of Fontainebleau, from the insect to the wild boar
    and from the stag to the lark, from the great oak and the rock
    mass to the fern and the blade of grass.</p>

    <p>Now a thing like that is not felt, nor even found by any
    chance comer.</p>

    <p>And Brion - oh, a maker of Alsatian type pictures, people
    would tell me. Very good, he has as a matter of fact done the
    &ldquo;Betrothal Feast,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Protestant
    Marriage,&rdquo; etc., which are indeed Alsatian. However, when
    no one could be found equal to illustrating <i>Les
    Mis&eacute;rables,</i> he did it in a way not yet
    surpassed, and he made no blunders about his characters. Is it
    a little thing to know people so well, and the humanity of that
    period so well, that you hardly ever make a mistake in an
    expression or in a character?</p>

    <p>As for <i>us</i>, we have to grow old in hard work, and that
    is why we eat our hearts out when things don't go well. I think
    that if one day you see the Brias Gallery at Montpellier, I
    think that then nothing will move you more than Brias himself
    when you realize, from his purchases, what he tried to be to
    artists. It is rather disheartening when you see some portraits
    of him, his face is so heartbroken and obviously
    frustrated.</p>

    <p>If one doesn't make a success of it in the South, there is
    always the thought of that man who suffered all his life for
    the same cause.</p>

    <p>The only serene portraits are the Delacroixs and the
    Ricards.</p>

    <p>By pure chance the one by Cabanel, for instance, is true and
    very interesting in its keenness of observation, at least it
    gives an idea of the man.</p>

    <p>I am glad that Jo's mother has come to Paris. Next year it
    will be a little different perhaps, and you will have a child,
    and that will bring a fair amount of the little worries of
    human life - but as some great worries of spleen, etc., will
    dis-appear forever, it is certainly the way things should
    go.</p>

    <p>I will write again soon, I am not writing to you as I should
    have liked. I hope that all is well at your home and will
    continue to be well. I'm very glad that Rivet has rid you of
    your cough, it worried me somewhat too!</p>

    <p>The trouble I had in my throat is beginning to disappear; I
    still eat with some difficulty, but after all it has got
    better.</p>

    <p>A good handshake for you and Jo.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
