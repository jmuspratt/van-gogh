  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is time for you to hear from me again. <label content="Theo.work">I have already
    heard from Father of your safe arrival and how you walked all
    over the city during those first days. I am very curious to
    hear what your first impressions were, so as soon as you can
    find time to write, your letter will be welcomed.</label> It is true,
    however, that first impressions often change, for we know only
    too well that all is not gold that glitters and that though
    there may be a bright dawn, there is also a dark midnight and a
    burning, oppressive heat at noon. But just as the morning hour
    is blessed and is worth much gold, so first impressions keep
    their value even though they pass, for sometimes they prove to
    have been right after all, and one comes back to them. So write
    me what you saw these first days and what your thoughts have
    been.</p>

    <p>Just now we are having bad weather here, and probably it is
    the same in Paris. You will soon perceive that it is much
    warmer there in summer than in Holland, and you will also see
    thundery skies like the ones Bonington painted. The quarter of
    town where you live is rather interesting. When one walks
    through the streets there, or towards Montmartre in the morning
    or evening, one sees many a workshop, and many a little room
    that reminds one of &ldquo;Un Tonnelier&rdquo; or &ldquo;Les
    Couturi&egrave;res&rdquo; or other pictures by &Eacute;douard
    Fr&egrave;re. At times it is good to see such simple things
    when one sees so many people who for different reasons have
    strayed from all that is natural and so have lost their real
    and inner life, and when one also sees so many who live in
    misery and horror - for in the evening and at night one sees
    all kinds of black figures wandering about, men as well as
    women, in whom the terror of the night is personified, and
    whose misery one must class among the things that have no name
    in any language.</p>

    <p>Last week one of the clergymen here died; he was known all
    over the country (Pantekoek). He was buried last Saturday; that
    procession on the path along the green borders of the Amstel
    reminded me of &ldquo;In Memoriam.&rdquo; He was the father of
    six children, the eldest about twenty years old. A large crowd
    followed and they literally jostled each other. A memorial
    service was held in almost all the churches yesterday. I heard
    Uncle Stricker, who had known him very well. He preached in the
    Oudezijd Chapel, where the boys from the orphanage and those
    from the sailors' training school usually go. The sermon was
    full of sentiment. Uncle's text was, &ldquo;I am greatly
    distressed and what shall I say?&rdquo; He had undergone
    terrible and long suffering. One night I heard one of his last
    sermons, and it was clear from what he said that he shuddered
    and shrank from each new day and night, especially from the one
    which followed the exertion of preaching. Even then one could
    not hear him without feeling with him and shuddering
    involuntarily, for the road leading to the eternal home is
    dark, and happy is he who is strengthened by the hope of a
    better life when the darkness and night approaches.</p>

    <p>Do not let all the new distractions keep you from reading
    some good book, for instance, the one by Michelet on the
    Revolution, or something by Thor&eacute; or Th. Gautier on
    Paris and the time of the young painters and authors. Oh! boy,
    how I should like to wander with you through the city.</p>

    <p>Today I hope to take a long walk through the section of town
    where I have not often been. I finally found the house in the
    Breestraat where Rembrandt lived - you know we spoke about it
    when you were here. Think of that particular picture in the
    Luxembourg, &ldquo;Qui vous re&ccedil;oit me re&ccedil;oit, et
    qui me re&ccedil;oit, re&ccedil;oit celui qui m'a
    envoy&eacute;&rdquo; [He that receiveth you receiveth me, and
    he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me], and tell me
    who painted it.</p>

    <p>Paris is so beautiful in autumn; you will begin to notice it
    toward the end of September.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">Give my kind regards to all at Soek's, I so often remember
    an excursion I made with his family to Ville d'Avray. Entering
    the little church there, it struck me to find more than one
    picture by Corot - you know he was there often.</label></p>

    <p>Give also my compliments to Braat and Mutters. Have a good
    time and write soon, and imagine a warm handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>I still have to thank you for your photograph; it is very
    good and I am glad to have it, many thanks.</p>
