  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I feel strongly impelled to tell you again how much your
    visit has stimulated me. <sup>1</sup> I intend to start a
    number of larger compositions; in fact I've already started one
    of them. It is a composition of &ldquo;Peat Cutters in the
    Dunes.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Do you remember I told you that there was such a beautiful
    subject there in the dunes? It is something like putting up a
    barricade. I started it as soon as I came back from you, for it
    was already about ripe in my mind.</p>

    <p>In the same way I have thought a lot about some other
    compositions, for which I also have the studies. But if I
    hadn't had the money you gave me, I should not have been able
    to do it right now.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I had a wooden passe-partout made, something like yours but
    without a frame. I am thinking of giving this as yet unpainted
    passe-partout a walnut colour, the same colour as your
    <i>frame</i><i>.</i> The work gets on nicely when the drawing
    is shut off; and as soon as I saw your drawings I decided to
    get such a passe-partout too.</label></p>

    <p>I saw an illustration in Harper's Weekly by Reinhardt - by
    far the best thing I have seen of his so far - &ldquo;Washed
    Ashore.&rdquo; A corpse has been washed ashore, a man is
    kneeling beside it to see who it is, a number of fishermen and
    women are giving information about the shipwrecked man to a
    gendarme. So it somewhat resembles &ldquo;Une
    &Eacute;preuve&rdquo; [A Questioning], which you have, but
    there is something of, say, R&eacute;gamey in this drawing by
    Reinhardt; it is a very beautiful sheet.</p>

    <p>How much beauty one can find, can't one? <label content="art.technique">I have now sketched
    the Peat Cutters with charcoal, &ldquo;black mountain
    crayon&rdquo; and autographic ink [F 1031, JH 363]. I have not
    yet used the strong effects of printer's ink in it, so its
    aspect is not as vigorous as I imagine it may become. My only
    objection against charcoal is that it gets effaced so easily,
    which, unless one is very careful, causes one to lose things
    one has found. And there is something in my make-up that does
    not want to be too careful.</label></p>

    <p>I have some plans for large drawings which, my dear friend,
    will perhaps arouse your sympathy.</p>

    <p>I wish you had read Les Mis&eacute;rables <i>-</i> then it
    would be easier for me to speak to you about it, for you might
    be struck by the same things that are continually coming back
    to my mind - this would not surprise me. I already knew the
    book, but since I've reread it, many things in it keep
    returning to my thoughts again and again.</p>

    <p>You and I were taught something like history at school, but,
    if your experience was the same as mine, that was not enough;
    it was too dry and too conventional. Well, speaking for myself,
    I should like particularly to have a clear survey of the period
    from for instance 1770 to the present. The French Revolution is
    the very greatest modern event, and everything in our own time
    hinges on it too.</p>

    <p>When I read something like Paris and London [A Tale of Two
    Cities] by Dickens, and think it over, then I come to the
    conclusion that one can get such splendid subjects for drawings
    out of that revolutionary period - not bearing directly on
    history proper, but rather incidents of everyday life and the
    appearance of things as they used to be then. Take that drawing
    by Howard Pyle and the other one by Abbey, both of which I
    showed you some time ago - &ldquo;Christmas in old New
    York&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christmas in Old Virginia.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, letting one's thoughts dwell on the period beginning
    in those days and up to the present, one surveys an era in
    which everything has changed. And several moments are
    especially interesting. And in various French and English books
    you find them described so impressively and with so much
    ability that it becomes possible to get a clear image of those
    past things.</p>

    <p>Dickens, who usually wrote about his own time, could not
    resist writing the Tale of Two Cities, and every now and then
    we see descriptions of the old days inserted in his work - a
    description of the London streets before there were street
    lamps, for instance.</p>

    <p>Now the question is, could one find Dutch subjects, taken,
    for instance, from the time when the first street lamps were
    put up, or before they existed? Just imagine a church pew or a
    funeral scene around 1815; a house-moving, a public promenade,
    a street on a winter's day of the same period or somewhat
    later.</p>

    <p>In Les Mis&eacute;rables<i>,</i> although it treats of a
    later era, I find what I have been looking for - aspects of the
    past that induce me to remember how everything looked in my
    great-grandfather's day, or even no longer ago than my
    grandfather's time.</p>

    <p>Hugo's Quatre-vingt-treize was something that was
    illustrated by all the artists of the Graphic in a body.</p>

    <p>And how impressively Caldecott does it!</p>

    <p>I should like to see what kind of impression that
    Quatre-vingt-treize and Les Mis&eacute;rables would make on
    you. It's certain that you will think them beautiful. When I
    visited you, I saw some nooks of the town which my imagination
    enlivened with figures of the old days. Well, we shall probably
    have some more talks about drawings from a past period. I hope
    it will happen that you come here again this summer, as you
    said you would. It is not impossible that my brother in Paris
    will call on you this summer too; I want him to see your work
    again, and so, when he is here, I should like the two of us to
    go and see you.</p>

    <p>With a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
