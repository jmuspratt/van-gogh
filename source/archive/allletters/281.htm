  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>On your birthday I want you to receive a little word from me
    too. May it be a happy year for you, and may you have success
    in your work, and <label content="Theo.mistress">I do hope, especially, that you may have in
    this year some satisfaction for what you did for your patient;
    may she recover and start a new life.</label> Do you know it is almost
    a year since you were here? Yes - I long very much for your
    coming. It is the work of that whole year that I have to show
    you, about which we must speak in regard to the future.</p>

    <p>Do you think it will be about the same time as last year
    that you will come? Well, as soon as anything is decided about
    your coming, let me know.</p>

    <p>Some time ago you told me many things about these Swedish
    painters, Heyerdahl, Edelfelt.</p>

    <p>This week I found a reproduction of a picture by Edelfelt:
    &ldquo;A Prayer-Meeting on the Beach.&rdquo; There is something
    in it of Longfellow's poems; it is very beautiful. It shows a
    sentiment of which I am very fond, and which I think does more
    good in the world than the Italians and Spaniards with their
    &ldquo;Arms Merchants of Cairo,&rdquo; of which I get so tired
    in the long run.</p>

    <p>This week I have been working on the figure of a woman on
    the heath, who is gathering cuts of peat.</p>

    <p><art id=1027>And a kneeling figure of a man</art>.</p>

    <p>One must know the structure of the figures so thoroughly, in
    order to get the expression, at least I cannot see it
    differently.</p>

    <p>The Edelfelt is indeed beautiful in its expression, however
    the effect lies not only in the expression of the faces, but in
    the whole position of the figures.</p>

    <p>Do you know who has claims to being the cleverest of all
    these Swedes?</p>

    <p>It is perhaps a certain Wilhelm Leibl, [actually a German]
    an absolutely self-made man.</p>

    <p>I have a reproduction of a picture with which he suddenly
    came out, I think it was at the exhibition in Vienna in
    `82<b>.</b> It represents three women in a pew, one seated
    figure of a young woman in a checkered dress (Tyrol), two
    kneeling old women in black, with kerchiefs round their heads.
    Its sentiment is beautiful and drawn like Memling or Quinten
    Matsys. That picture seems to have made a great sensation among
    the artists at the time, I do not know what became of Leibl
    since then. I found him very much like Thijs Mans. In England
    there was also a German of that kind, but less clever - Paul de
    Gassow, who reminds me a little of Oberlander, whose heads you
    certainly remember. Well, there still seem to be some good
    artists in Sweden.</p>

    <p>I am longing again for your letter. As to what I wrote you
    about relations between women and their mothers, I can assure
    you, in my case nine-tenths of the difficulties I had with the
    woman originated directly or indirectly therein.</p>

    <p>And yet those mothers are not exactly bad, though they act
    absolutely wrongly.</p>

    <p>But they do not know what they are doing.</p>

    <p>Women of about the age of fifty are often distrustful, and
    perhaps it is that very distrust and cunning that entangles
    them. If you care to hear them, I can tell you some
    particulars some day. I do not know whether all women become
    more serious in getting older, and then want to govern and
    correct their daughters, which they do in exactly the wrong
    way.</p>

    <p>In some cases their system may have some raison
    d'&ecirc;tre; but they ought not to fix as a principle and
    accept a priori that all men are deceivers and fools, for which
    reason women must cheat them and suppose they know everything
    better. If, by ill chance, the mother-system is applied to a
    man who is honest and of good faith, he is indeed badly
    off.</p>

    <p>Well, the time has not yet come when <i>reason</i>,
    not only in the sense of <i>raison</i>, but also of la
    conscience, is respected by everyone; to contribute towards
    bringing about that time is a duty, and in judging characters
    one of the first things that humanity demands is to take into
    consideration the circumstances of contemporary society.</p>

    <p>How beautiful Zola is - it is especially L'Assommoir which I
    often think of. Apropos, how far did you get in reading Balzac?
    I have quite finished Les Mis&eacute;rables<i>.</i> I know very
    well that Victor Hugo analyses in a different way than do
    Balzac and Zola, but he probes to the bottom of things just as
    well.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I should prefer in the matter of relations
    between the woman and her mother - in my case where it has
    decidedly bad consequences - that the mother came to live with
    us entirely.</p>

    <p>I proposed it this winter, when the mother was very hard up,
    and I said: If you are so much attached to each other, then
    come and live together, but I believe they, though worse off
    themselves, don't think our simple way of living good enough,
    one which I desire on principle and to which I am forced by
    circumstances.</p>

    <p>Many people care more for the exterior than for the inward
    life of a family, thinking they act well in doing so. Society
    is full of that: people who strive to make a show instead of
    leading a true existence. I repeat: those people are not bad,
    but they are foolish.</p>

    <p>However great the difference between the persons in question
    may be, keep an eye on the relations between your patient and
    her mother. Don't make the mistake of thinking that I suspect
    the mother of something definitely evil - no, but I should be
    surprised if she did not possess her share of the general
    foolishness. And if your patient did not possess every woman's
    inclination to blunder in the choice of ones whom she wants to
    be led by.</p>

    <p>A wife's mother is, in some cases, the representative of a
    meddlesome, slandering, aggravating family, and as such
    decidedly injurious and hostile, though she may not be so bad
    herself.</p>

    <p>In my case, she would be much better off in my house than in
    the houses of other members of the family, where she is very
    often the victim of callous insolence and is incited to
    intrigues.</p>

    <p>Did you ever think of this quality in your patient's mother?
    She may acquire it to a certain extent - therefore be on the
    qui vive. And with regard to such persons, it is possible that
    you yourself foresee also that they will prove not to have the
    same desirable ideas about reserve as you and your patient.</p>

    <p>Towards your patient you have been absolutely honest and
    straightforward: that is the principal thing, which keeps the
    future clear, whatever it may be: but even if one has acted
    rightly, difficulties may arise. Well, in the year that begins
    for you today, I wish you very few of those - on the contrary
    may all good be your share. Well, write soon if you have not
    written already, which I hope will be the case. Adieu, boy,
    with a hearty handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
