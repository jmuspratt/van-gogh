  <body>
    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter of December 22, containing a
    50-fr. note. First of all I wish you and Jo a Happy New Year
    <label content="health.mental">and regret that I have perhaps, though quite unwillingly,
    caused you worry, because M. Peyron must have informed you that
    my mind has once more been deranged.</label></p>

    <p>At the moment of writing, I have not yet seen M. Peyron, so
    I do not know if he has written anything about my pictures.
    While I was ill, he came to tell me that he had heard from you
    and to ask whether or not I wanted to exhibit my pictures. I
    told him that I would rather not exhibit them. There was no
    justification for that and so I hope they were sent off anyway.
    But anyway I am sorry not to have been able to see M. Peyron
    today, to ask him what he has written you. Anyway, it doesn't
    seem very important on the whole, since you say that it starts
    as late as January 3, so this will still reach you in time.</p>

    <p>What a misfortune for Gauguin, that child falling out of the
    window and his not being able to be there. I often think of
    him, what misfortunes that man has in spite of his energy and
    so many unusual qualities. I think it is splendid that our
    sister is coming to help you when Jo has her confinement.</p>

    <p>May that go well - I think about you two a great deal, I
    assure you.</p>

    <p>Now what you say about my work certainly pleases me, but I
    keep thinking about this accursed trade in which one is caught
    as in a net, and in which one becomes less useful than other
    people. But there, it's no use, alas! fretting about that - and
    we must do what we can.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">Odd that I had been working perfectly calmly on some
    canvases that you will soon see, and that suddenly, without any
    reason, the aberration seized me again.</label></p>

    <p>I do not know what M. Peyron is going to advise, but while
    taking what he tells me into account, I think that he will dare
    less than ever to commit himself as to the possibility of my
    living as I used to. It is to be feared that the attacks will
    return. But that is no reason at all for not trying to distract
    oneself a little.</p>

    <p>For cooping up all these lunatics in this old cloister
    becomes, I think, a dangerous thing, in which you risk losing
    the little good sense that you may still have kept. Not that I
    am set on this or that by preference. I am used to the life
    here, but one must not forget to make a little trial of the
    opposite.</p>

    <p>However that may be, you see that I write comparatively
    calmly.</p>

    <p>What you write about M. Lauzet's visit is very interesting,
    I think that when I send the canvases which are still here, he
    will certainly come back once more, and if I were there, I
    think I also should start lithographing.</p>

    <p>Perhaps these canvases in question will be the very thing
    for Reid.</p>

    <p>Above all, I must not waste my time, I am going to set to
    work again as soon as M. Peyron permits it; if he does not
    permit it, then I shall be through with this place. It is that
    which keeps me comparatively well balanced, and I have a lot of
    new ideas for new pictures.</p>

    <p>Oh, while I was ill there was a fall of damp and melting
    snow. I got up in the night to look at the country. Never,
    never had nature seemed to me so touching and so full of
    feeling.</p>

    <p>The rather superstitious ideas they have here about painting
    sometimes depress me more than I can tell you, because
    basically it is really fairly true that a painter as a man is
    too absorbed in what his eyes see, and is not sufficiently
    master of the rest of his life.</p>

    <p>If you saw the last letter Gauguin wrote me, you would be
    touched to see how straight he thinks, and for so powerful a
    man to be almost helpless is unfortunate. And Pissarro too, and
    Guillaumin the same. What a business, what a business.</p>

    <p>I have just received a letter from Mother and from Wil
    too.</p>

    <p>Just now you and Jo will have many anxieties at times, and a
    bad time to get through, but these are the things without which
    life would not be life, and it makes one serious. It is a good
    idea to have Wil there.</p>

    <p>As for me, don't worry too much. I fight calmly against my
    disease, and I think that I shall soon be able to take up my
    work again.</p>

    <p>And this will be another lesson to me to work
    straightforwardly and without too many hidden meanings, which
    disturb one's consciousness. A picture, a book, must not be
    despised, and if it is my duty to do this, I must not hanker
    after something different.</p>

    <p>It is time for this letter to go. Once more thanks for yours
    and a good handshake for you and Jo, believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent.</p>
