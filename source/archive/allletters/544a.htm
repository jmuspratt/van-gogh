    <p>[In the Dutch edition this letter appears under number
    553a]</p>

    <p>Arles, 3 October 1888</p>

    <p>[Sent by Gauguin to Schuffenecker on October 8, 1888, with
    the observation: &ldquo;I am sending you a letter from Vincent
    to let you know how things stand between us and with all our
    present plans.&rdquo;]</p>

    <p>My dear Gauguin,</p>

    <p>This morning I received your excellent letter, which I have
    again sent on to my brother. Your view of impressionism in
    general, of which your portrait is a symbol, is striking. No
    one could be more anxious than I am to see it - but I am sure
    even now that this work is too important for me to take in
    exchange. But if you would like to keep it for us, my brother
    will, if you agree, buy it at the first opportunity - and I
    immediately asked him to do so - so let's hope it happens
    soon.</p>

    <p>For we are trying once more to make it as easy as possible
    for you to come here soon.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">I must tell you that even while working I think continually
    about the plan of setting up a studio in which you and I will
    be permanent residents, but which both of us want to turn into
    a shelter and refuge for friends, against the times when they
    find that the struggle is getting too much for them.</label></p>

    <p>When you left Paris, my brother and I stayed on together for
    a time, which will always remain an unforgettable memory for
    me. The discussions ranged further and wider - with Guillaumin,
    with the Pissarros, father and son, and with Seurat, whom I had
    not met before (I visited his studio only a few hours before my
    departure).</p>

    <p>These discussions often dealt with something so near to my
    brother's heart and mine, namely what steps to take in order to
    safeguard the material existence of painters, to safeguard
    their means of production (paints, canvases) and to safeguard
    their true share in the price their pictures fetch these days -
    though not until long after they have left the artist's
    possession.</p>

    <p>When you are here, we can mull over all these
    discussions.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">Anyway, when I left Paris I was in a sorry state, quite ill
    and almost an alcoholic after driving myself on even while my
    strength was failing me - and then withdrawing into myself,
    still bereft of hope!</label></p>

    <p>Now, hope is vaguely beckoning on the horizon again, that
    flickering hope which used sometimes to console my solitary
    life.</p>

    <p>I should so much like to imbue you with a large share of my
    faith that we shall succeed in starting something that will
    endure.</p>

    <p>When we have had a talk about those strange days spent in
    discussion in run-down studios and the caf&eacute;s of the
    Petit Boulevard, you will understand the full scope of this
    idea of my brother's and mine - as yet unrealized when it comes
    to setting up a society.</p>

    <p>Still, you will appreciate that in order to remedy the
    terrible situation of the last few years something is needed,
    either along the precise lines we proposed or else very much
    like them. That much we have taken for our unshakeable
    foundation, as you will gather when you have the full
    explanation. And you will agree that we have gone a good way
    beyond the plan we have already communicated to you. That we
    have gone beyond it is no more than our duty as picture
    dealers, for you probably know that I, too, spent several years
    in the trade and do not despise a profession in which I used to
    earn my living. Suffice it to say that I'm sure that, although
    you have apparently isolated yourself from Paris, you haven't
    stopped feeling a fairly close rapport with Paris.</p>

    <p>I am having an extraordinary spell of feverish activity
    these days. Right now I am tackling<art id=0475> a landscape with a blue sky
    above an immense green, purple and yellow vineyard, with black
    and orange vines. Little figures of ladies with red parasols
    and little figures of grape pickers with their small cart make
    it even gayer. Grey sand in the foreground. Another size 30
    square canvas to decorate the house</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I've <art id=0476>a portrait of myself, all ash grey</art>.
    The ashen colour - which has been obtained by mixing malachite green with orange
    lead - on pale malachite background, all in harmony with the
    reddish-brown clothes.</label> Not wishing to exaggerate my own
    personality, however, I aimed rather for the character of a
    bonze, a simple worshipper of the eternal Buddha. Though I have taken rather a lot of trouble
    with it, I shall have to go over it again if I want to express the idea
    properly, and I shall have to recover even further from the
    stultifying effect of our so-called state of civilization if I
    am to have a better model for a better picture.</p>

    <p>One thing that gives me enormous pleasure is the letter I
    received yesterday from Boch (his sister is one of the Belgian
    Vingtistes), who writes that he has settled down in the
    Borinage to paint miners and coal mines there. He nevertheless
    intends to return to the south - to vary his impressions - and
    if he does he is certain to come to Arles.</p>

    <p>I consider my views of art excessively ordinary compared
    with yours.</p>

    <p>I have always had the coarse tastes of an animal.</p>

    <p>I neglect everything for the external beauty of things,
    <i>which I cannot reproduce</i> because I render it so ugly and
    coarse in my pictures, albeit nature seems so perfect to
    me.</p>

    <p>At present, however, my bony carcass is so full of energy
    that it makes straight for its objective. The result is a
    degree of sincerity, perhaps original at times, about what I
    feel, but only if the subject lends itself to my crude and
    clumsy touch.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">I feel sure that if from now on you were to consider
    yourself head of this studio, which we shall try to ensure will
    become a refuge for many - little by little, as our unremitting
    labour provides us with the means of completing it - I'm sure
    that you would then feel more or less consoled for the present
    ordeals of penury and ill-health, seeing that we shall probably
    be devoting our lives to a generation of painters that will
    last a long while to come.</label></p>

    <p>This part of the country has already seen the cult of Venus
    - in Greece, primarily artistic - followed by the poets and
    artists of the Renaissance. Where these things could flourish,
    impressionism can as well.</p>

    <p>I have made a special decoration, <art id=0468>the Poet's garden</art>, for the
    room you will have (there is <art id=1450>a first draft of it among the
    sketches in Bernard's possession</art> - it was later simplified).
    The ordinary public garden contains plants and shrubs that
    conjure up landscapes in which one can readily imagine
    Botticelli, Giotto, Petrarch, Dante and Boccaccio. I have tried
    to distil in the decoration the essence of what constitutes the
    immutable character of this country.</p>

    <p>And I set out to paint that garden in such a way that one is
    put in mind of the old poet from these parts (or rather from
    Avignon), Petrarch, and of the new poet from these parts - Paul
    Gauguin - .</p>

    <p>However clumsy this attempt may be, it may show you perhaps
    that I have been thinking of you with very great emotion as I
    prepared your studio.</p>

    <p>Let's be of good heart about the success of our venture, and
    please keep thinking of this as your home, for I feel very sure
    that all this will last for a very long time.</p>

    <p>A warm handshake, and believe me</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I am only afraid that you will think Brittany more
    beautiful, indeed, that you will find nothing more beautiful
    here than Daumier, the figures here are often pure Daumier. It
    shouldn't take you long to discover that antiquity and the
    renaissance lie dormant under all this modernity. Well, you are
    free to revive them.</p>

    <p>Bernard tells me that he, Morel, Laval and somebody else
    will be making exchanges with me. In principle I am very much
    in favour of the system of exchanges between artists because I
    have seen the important part it played in the life of the
    Japanese painters. Accordingly, one of these days I shall be
    sending you what studies I have that are dry and that I can
    spare, so that you may have first pick. But I shall make no
    exchanges at all with you if it means that on your side it
    costs you something as important as your portrait, which is
    sure to be too beautiful. Truly, I wouldn't dare, because my
    brother would gladly buy it from you for a whole month's
    money.</p>
