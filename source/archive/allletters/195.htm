  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your letter with enclosed 100 fr. and thank you
    very much for it.</p>

    <p>Your letter has given me more light than all my own worry
    and fretting about that problem of Mauve and Tersteeg. I
    congratulate you on finding it out, for now I think I
    understand it better. And if I understand you correctly, the
    only thing I have to do is to work on quietly without worrying
    and thinking about it as much as I did. If I think too much
    about it, I get that same dizzy feeling which you say a person
    who has not studied perspective gets, when he tries to follow
    the fugitive lines in a landscape and to account for them.</p>

    <p>And just as the whole perspective changes with the shifted
    position of the eye, which does not depend on the object, but
    on the man who is looking (whether he stoops or stands on an
    elevation), so I think the change in Mauve and Tersteeg has
    been in part only imaginary, and can be accounted for by my own
    state of mind. I do not see clearly in such things, but your
    letter showed me distinctly that there is no reason for me to
    worry if only I work on. And now enough of this, there are
    other things I want to write about.</p>

    <p>I was greatly touched by Heyerdahl's sympathy. Give him my
    best regards, and tell him I certainly hope to make his
    acquaintance someday, and shall greatly appreciate it.</p>

    <p>Now I have finished two larger drawings. First,
    <art id=929a>&ldquo;Sorrow&rdquo; in a larger size</art> - only the figure,
    without any surroundings. The pose has been
    changed a little: the hair is not hanging down the back, but
    falls over the shoulder partly in a plait, so more of the
    shoulder, neck and back is in view. And the figure has been
    drawn more carefully. The other,<art id=933> &ldquo;The Roots,&rdquo; shows
    some tree roots on sandy ground</art>. Now I tried to
    put the same sentiment into the landscape as I put into the
    figure: the convulsive, passionate clinging to the earth, and
    yet being half torn up by the storm. I wanted to express
    something of the struggle for life in that pale, slender
    woman's figure, as well as in the black, gnarled and knotty
    roots. Or rather, because I tried to be faithful to nature as I
    saw it, without philosophizing about it, involuntarily in both
    cases something of that great struggle is shown. At least it
    seemed to me there was some sentiment in them, but I may be
    mistaken; well, you must judge for yourself.</p>

    <p>If you like them, they will perhaps be fit for your new
    home; and then I have made them for your birthday, for which I
    send you my best wishes. But as they are rather large (a full
    page Ingres), I don't know if I can send them immediately. Tell
    me, do you think Tersteeg would call me impudent or pretentious
    if I asked to have them enclosed when a box goes to Paris?</p>

    <p>Though &ldquo;The Roots&rdquo; is only a pencil drawing, I
    have brushed it in with lead pencil and scraped it off again,
    as I would if I were painting.</p>

    <p>This is how I reason about the carpenter's pencil. What did
    the old masters use for drawing? Certainly not Faber B, BB,
    BBB, etc., etc., but a piece of rough graphite. Perhaps the
    instrument which Michelangelo and D&uuml;rer used somewhat
    resembled a carpenter's pencil. But I was not there to see it
    for myself, so I don't know; I only know that with a
    carpenter's pencil one can get effects quite different from
    those with thin Fabers, etc.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I prefer the graphite in its natural form to that ground so
    fine in those expensive Fabers. And the shininess disappears by
    throwing some milk over it. When working outdoors with
    cont&eacute; crayon, the strong light prevents one from seeing
    clearly what one is doing, and one perceives that it has become
    too black; but graphite is more grey than black, and one can
    always raise it a few tones by working in it with the pen, so
    that the strongest graphite effect becomes light again in
    contrast to the ink.</label></p>

    <p>Charcoal is good, but if one works at it too long, it loses
    its freshness, and one must fix it immediately to preserve the
    delicacy of touch. In landscape too, I see that draughtsmen
    like, for instance, Ruysdael and Van Goyen, and Calame and
    Roelofs too among the moderns, used it to great advantage. But
    perhaps there would be more pen drawings in the world if
    somebody invented a good pen for use outdoors, with an inkstand
    to go with it. One can do great things with charcoal soaked in
    oil, I have seen Weissenbruch do it; the oil fixes the charcoal
    and at the same time the black becomes warmer and deeper.</p>

    <p>But I say to myself that it's better to do it in a year than
    to do it now, because I do not want the beauty to come from the
    material, but from within myself. When I am a little more
    advanced I shall occasionally dress up nicely - that means I
    shall work with a more effective drawing material. And then if
    only I have some power within me, things will go doubly
    smoothly and the result will be better than I expected.</p>

    <p>But before any success there must first come the
    hand-to-hand struggle with the things in nature.</p>

    <p>Last year I wrote you a great many letters full of
    reflections on love. Now I no longer do so because I am too
    busy putting those same things into practice. She for whom I
    felt what I wrote you about is not in my path, she is out of my
    reach in spite of all my passionate longing. Would it have been
    better to have kept thinking of her always and to have
    overlooked what came my way? I cannot decide myself whether I
    acted consistently or inconsistently.</p>

    <p>Suppose I began today a drawing of a digger, for instance,
    but he said, I must go, I will not or cannot pose any longer.
    As I had begun to draw him without asking his permission, I
    have no right to be angry with him for leaving me with an
    unfinished drawing. But must I now give up drawing a digger
    entirely?</p>

    <p>I think not, especially if tomorrow I may meet another who
    says, I will come not just today, but tomorrow and the day
    after tomorrow; I understand what you want, do as you like, I
    have the patience and goodwill to help you. Though I should not
    then remain true to my first impression, would it have been
    better to have said, No, I must decidedly have that first
    digger, even though he says, I cannot and I will not? And once
    I begin No. 2, I certainly can't work with the thought of No.
    1, for then I should not be true to nature; that is the point.
    And I add this to my previous letter. I want your help in order
    to succeed, but I think the expenses would not be more, but
    rather less than what you have sent these past months.</p>

    <p>I will and dare undertake it if I may count on 150 fr. a
    month for another year.</p>

    <p>Well, I hope to earn something besides, and if this fails, I
    shall have to stint myself, it's true; but I shall manage. And
    then afterward when that year is past? -</p>

    <p>I think nothing in my work indicates I shall fail, if I only
    can continue to work and do my best. And I am not a person who
    works slowly or irresolutely. Drawing becomes a passion with
    me, and I throw myself into it more and more; and where there's
    a will, there's a way.</p>

    <p>Where [there] is a will, [there] is a way <sup>1</sup>, but
    it must come from both sides. <i>The will</i> in me must be the
    making of things; <i>the will</i> in those who have or might
    get sympathy for me must be the buying or selling of those
    things. <i>The will</i> being there, I think <i>the way</i> may
    be found.</p>

    <p>But if everybody talked like Tersteeg about
    &ldquo;unsaleable&rdquo; and &ldquo;without charm,&rdquo; heaps
    of annoyances would be in store for me. However this may be, I
    will try even harder to conquer the &ldquo;unsaleable&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;without charm.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It has been very stormy for three nights. Last Saturday
    night the window of my studio gave way (the house I live in is
    very shaky); four large window panes broke and the frame was
    torn loose. You can imagine it was not pleasant. The wind came
    blowing across the open meadows and my window got it firsthand
    - the drawings torn from the wall, the easel upset, the railing
    downstairs also thrown down. With my neighbour's help I have
    been able to tie up the window, and I nailed a blanket in front
    of the hole, which is at least three feet square.</p>

    <p>[art id=216_V-T_1950>Sketch of the layout of the studio.</art>]</p>

    <p>I didn't sleep a wink all night, as you can imagine. And there
    was great trouble about getting it fixed the next day, because
    it was Sunday. The landlord is a poor devil; he gave the glass,
    I paid for the labour. But this is another reason why I want to
    take the house next door. It is arranged thus:</p>

    <p>The studio, larger than mine, the light very good. The attic
    is finished, so that you do not see the rafters and tiles; very
    large, so that you can divide it into as many rooms as you like
    (I have the partitions for it). The rent is 12.50 guilders a
    month for a strong, well-built house; it is that cheap because
    it is &ldquo;only in the Schenkweg,&rdquo; and the rich people
    whom the owner expected to get do not want to live there. I
    should like to take it very much, and the owner would like to
    have me; he spoke to me about it first, and then I went to see
    it.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">And now I close by saying that I assure you I often think of
    home, and I suppose when six months have passed by and the
    thing I wrote you about has happened, and Father and Mother
    come to see me, on both sides this would produce a change in
    our feelings.</label> But alas, the moment has not arrived yet, and
    first we must try to get things started. For Father and Mother,
    whom I consider outsiders in this respect, will like it very
    much when it is more finished (has more finesse, as the Belgian
    dealers say, according to Mauve); but the rough sketch that you
    would understand if you were here would make them dizzy, to say
    the least. Adieu, best wishes,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I will not send the drawings if you intend to come soon. But
    it is time you received some of my things now and then; I do my
    best, and if these two, for instance, please you, I will send
    you some more of various kinds.</p>

    <p>If you show those you think suitable to people who happen to
    come to your room, it may be the beginning of selling them.
    When more and different ones by the same hand are together,
    they show to better advantage, and one explains and compliments
    the other.</p>

    <p>The thing I value most is your sympathy. If I win that, the
    selling will follow.</p>

    <p>But that sympathy of yours cannot be forced by either you or
    me. I think I can produce a great deal - I mean I can work
    quickly, without dawdling. After you returned the old studies
    as I asked you, I sent you two new ones (&ldquo;Laan van
    Meerdervoort&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sorrow&rdquo;) to prove I can do
    more if you like them. If you say it is not ripe yet, I will
    work on without sending them; what I sent was no accident - I
    am really <i>able</i> to do what I'm doing now. I shall have to
    study for some time to do better. But what I want to say is: If
    the last ones I have sent you are good enough for you to show,
    then I can begin to send what I have ready.</p>

    <p>Those you think the best ought to be mounted in grey, and so
    by degrees you will get a small collection. Think it over. I
    have some more drawings - <art id=116a>an old man by the hearth</art>,
    an old woman of the Geest, a few female figures - which,
    added to the others, would do well, I think. Also more small
    sketches.</p>

    <p>I am not saying this to hurry you, but it will do no harm to
    think it over. You began to help me without knowing what the
    result would be and when others refused their help. I should be
    glad if the result were that you could say quite coolly to
    those who think it foolish of you to help me that you have not
    lost by it. And that stimulates me to work even harder, and I
    think you must begin to take a few drawings, and every month I
    will send some more. There are days when I make five of them,
    but one has to count on the fact that out of twenty drawings
    one is successful. But that one of the twenty is no accident -
    I can count on it. There will be one every week, of which I
    feel, it will last.</p>

    <p>It is better if you keep those that are
    &ldquo;lasting&rdquo; for the present than if I sell them for
    10 guilders to somebody here who takes them out of pity or
    charity. Here they all criticize the technique, but they all
    say the same hackneyed things about the English drawings, for
    instance. Only Weissenbruch - when I told him, I see things
    like pen drawings - said, &ldquo;Then you must draw with the
    pen.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He, Weissenbruch, has not seen the small but the large
    &ldquo;Sorrow,&rdquo; and has said pleasing things about it to
    me. That's why I dare to speak as I do about the large one. I
    have had no &ldquo;guidance or teaching&rdquo; from others to
    speak of, but taught myself; no wonder my technique, considered
    superficially, differs from that of others. But that's no
    reason for my work to remain unsaleable. I feel pretty sure
    that the large &ldquo;Sorrow,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Old Woman of
    the Geest,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Old Man,&rdquo; and others, will
    find a purchaser someday. But maybe I shall work a little more
    on them later. I have worked on the &ldquo;Laan van
    Meerdervoort&rdquo; again. In front of me is a drawing of a
    woman in a black merino dress; I know for sure that after you
    have had it for a few days, you will be quite reconciled to the
    technique, and not wish it were done differently. I did not
    understand the English drawings the first day either, but
    &ldquo;I took the trouble to become acquainted with
    them,&rdquo; and have not regretted it.</p>

    <p>Adieu, enough for today.</p>
