    <p>Letter T23<br>
     Paris, 3 January 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Your letter was a pleasant surprise to me, for after
    receiving a note from Mr. Peyron, I dared not hope that you
    would be able to write, and I will not conceal from you that it
    grieved me very much.</p>

    <p>It is curious that it overtook you exactly one year after
    your first attack, and it proves that you must be always on
    your guard. So, for instance, if you know that it is dangerous
    for you to have colours near you, why don't you clear them away
    for a time, and make drawings? Like the other times, this
    crisis may be followed by another one, though it may be much
    less violent. I think that at such moments you would do better
    not to work with colours. After some time there will be nothing
    to prevent your starting again.</p>

    <p>There is a misunderstanding about the consignment to
    Brussels. The worthy Dr. Peyron made a mistake when he read my
    letter. The pictures were ready in time, and will be sent off
    today. What I asked was whether you wanted to include some
    drawings. To return once again to what I just said, if you do
    not work with colours for a while, nothing will prevent you
    from making drawings.</p>

    <p>Wil has been staying with us since last night; she is
    looking well, and brought good news from home; your letter gave
    Mother a great deal of pleasure. <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>I have had no news from Gauguin. He is very happy because De
    Haan is with him, for the latter pays for his whole maintenance
    and for his paints, but I don't know whether he will be able to
    go on forever. I hope you are feeling better already, and that
    the disease will not return.</p>

    <p>Kindest regards from Jo and Wil. Be of good heart and take
    care of yourself.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
