    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>2 March 1878</p>

    <p>The concern about Vincent oppresses us heavily. I foresee
    that again a bomb is going to burst. It is apparent that the
    beginning of his studies are disappointing to him, and his
    heart seems to be torn by conflicting forces. He has now tied
    up connections with English and French clergymen of
    ultra-orthodox views - and as a result the number of faults in
    his work has increased again. I am afraid he has no idea what
    studying means, and now I fear the remedy he will choose will
    be again a proposal for a change, for instance to become a
    catechist! But that doesn't bring in any bread! We sit and
    wait, and it is like the calm before the storm.</p>

    <p>To us, it is a vexation of our souls, and yet we believe in
    relief that God can accomplish. He creates light in the
    darkness! But also, there is a close relation between human
    errors and sad results. Does this happen also under God's
    guidance? - and it is amazing that we experience pain and
    sorrow when he always goes his way as with bowed head, while we
    have done everything we could to lead him to an honorable goal?
    It is as if he purposely chooses the ways that lead to
    difficulties.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Van Gogh</p>

    <p>2 March 1878</p>

    <p>You know, he is always a faithful writer, and now we haven't
    had a letter for a fortnight. You will remember that Pa was not
    quite reassured when he had seen him; Pa wrote him about it
    once more, and then we received such a strange conflicting
    reply&hellip;But how unhappy he must be, poor boy, you can well
    imagine how it worries us. He probably doesn't want anything
    else but a position with the church but without study; what a
    prospect for his living and his honour!</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>April 1878</p>

    <p>I am afraid he is very unhappy, but what can we do about it?
    We encourage him and give him the opportunity of continuing his
    studies, although we hardly know how to manage. It is a sickly
    existence he has chosen, I'm afraid, and how much he will still
    have to endure, and we together with him.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>11 May 1878</p>

    <p>So your work will be of a somewhat different kind from what
    we had thought, and you will have to be at the exhibition most
    of the time.</p>

    <p>[Mother] Our whole heart travelled after you and keeps
    following you and praying for the Lord's blessing. Do not start
    a single day without the good Lord, my child. In that big world
    full of distraction and temptation you can't do without Him,
    just as little as we in our quiet spot in Etten; and whatever
    the circumstances, don't forget life is earnest, then you will
    increase not only in knowledge, but also in firmness, which is
    the basis and source of a happy life - something we wish you
    above all.</p>

    <p>[Reverend van Gogh] You say that among the young people
    there they do not understand why you have been picked for the
    job. Is it possible that they are jealous? Then take care, do
    not trust <i>unconditionally</i> every friendship that is being
    offered. Think of intrigues! Which are somehow ascribed to that
    metropolis! If one should tempt you to any spending beyond your
    means: be <i>doubly</i> on your guard! When one plans someone's
    downfall, the system of making him <i>run up debts</i> is
    fairly customary to throw a net over his head! But do not think
    I look at things too darkly. Only watch out. I do know that you
    do not intend anything else, we trust you! But is it surprising
    that we - who <i>know what disappointment is</i> - also think a
    little further ahead?</p>

    <p>Mrs. van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>12 May 1878</p>

    <p>Dear Theo, do remain the crown for us old ones, which is
    shaken so often.</p>

    <p>[Reverend van Gogh] You evidently enjoy life and are well
    able to overcome your difficulties. It is really a stroke of
    luck to be able to look at that colossal world around you and
    observe representatives of all nations and people behaving at
    their best and less than best, and then with so much art around
    you&hellip;and far, very far away so many who think of you with
    love and interest and confidence, and already look forward to
    receiving a word or two from you.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>7 June 1878</p>

    <p>We don't know yet where this crisis will lead
    to&hellip;Because I did not want to rush things, I told him
    that for the time being he should go on with his lessons for
    three months, giving me time to think things over. In the
    meantime I have written to the Reverend Van der Brink, who is
    now a parson at Roesselaere in Belgium, asking him whether he
    might be used in that country. The reverend Van der Brink
    thinks it not impossible that a post as evangelist might become
    available for which knowledge of English and French would be an
    asset. He will keep me informed and try to help.</p>

    <p>[&hellip;] Perhaps we should risk this experiment as a last
    resort, but everything is still so uncertain. It is a problem
    that worries us seriously, but let us not lose courage. You
    have always said: who knows whether he will not pull through
    some day and succeed. May God grant it.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>8 July 1878</p>

    <p>[Vincent has come home] last Friday evening [5<sup>th</sup>
    July].</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>28 July 1878</p>

    <p>It was last Tuesday and Wednesday that we were there, and we
    have seen a lot of people. What we have decided now is that we
    will arrange for a try-out period of three months - against
    payment for board on our side - to see whether he would have a
    chance in succeeding. Vincent spoke perfectly well and made a
    good impression as far as I know. After all, his staying abroad
    has not been completely fruitless, nor has the year spent in
    Amsterdam, when he is called upon he is able to prove that he
    has learned and observed a lot in the school of life.</p>

    <p>However, the cause of evangelization in Belgium cannot boast
    of a solid monetary base; it is started and continued in faith.
    But most of the time, if money was necessary, there was no lack
    of it. The reverend Pietersen from Malines joined us and led us
    to the Reverend de Jong in Brussels, who had asked us to stay
    with him.</p>

    <p>[&hellip;] It was a pleasant coincidence that the Reverend
    Jones, with whom Vincent had been in England, could accompany
    us. He had arrived the preceding Saturday, and stayed till
    Tuesday, when he went to Brussels with us. He is a nice human
    being, who has made a good impression upon us all. In Brussels
    he spoke well of Vincent, and his presence caused the
    discussion to be held mostly in English; this gave Vincent the
    opportunity to show us that he could speak it quickly and
    correctly, for which they gave him a compliment. We now wait
    for further instructions about when and how he will start
    work.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>August 1878</p>

    <p>[Vincent will depart for Brussels on the 24 August].</p>

    <p>[Mother] May everything go well with Vincent, but Oh, Theo,
    it isn't clear yet, he is more absent-minded than ever.
    Probably also because he really concentrates on his thoughts on
    his sermons, of which he is making a whole stock. On Saturday
    he will go, and so will Lies, and then it will be very quiet
    here.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>24 November 1878</p>

    <p>I am on the point of going to Brussels. Mr. Plugge wrote me
    about Vincent. He is weak and thin - it seems he was not given
    any prospects, and I am worried.<label content="psychology.insomnia"> According to Mr. Plugge's
    letter, he cannot sleep </label>and seems to be in a nervous condition.
    Therefore I want to go and see for myself what we should
    do.</p>

    <p>[Mother] Tomorrow is the end of the three month period; we
    are almost sure he will not be accepted. We don't talk about it
    to anybody, don't do that either. We say to the people who know
    that Father will go on a journey that Vincent is ill. You can
    well imagine what a sad journey. Mr. Plugge asked us to come
    and take him home. What is going to become of all this?</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Reverend P&eacute;ron, Protestant
    Minister at Dour.</p>

    <p>5 December 1878</p>

    <p>Dear Sir, Having received a letter from my son Vincent, who
    wrote that he had addressed himself to you to ask for some
    work, and who said to you, Sir, wished to have some more
    information about him from me, his father, I hasten to comply
    with your request by telling you: That it is really my son who,
    having been looking for a place as evangelist in Belgium for
    three months now, came to see you in the hope that you might
    give him some light, giving him the advice and information
    which he needs.</p>

    <p>[&hellip;] May God grant him to find with you the
    possibility of gaining his bread by practical work of an honest
    kind.</p>
