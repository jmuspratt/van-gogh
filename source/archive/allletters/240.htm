  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>For the last few days I have been very much preoccupied by
    something which may possibly interest you, and I think it quite
    worth while to write you about it in detail. In a letter from
    Rappard, I received the summary of a discourse by Herkomer on
    modern wood engravings. I cannot tell you the whole in detail;
    perhaps you have read the article yourself (it appeared in an
    English art magazine, perhaps the Art Journal). It dealt
    particularly with the drawings in the Graphic. Herkomer tells
    how he himself worked on it with great zeal and enthusiasm, and
    recalls especially the splendid pages of the first series. He
    can hardly find words to express how strongly he feels the
    importance of the work of those original artists. He surveys
    the progress in technique and process and the difference
    between the old and the modern wood engravings, etc., etc.</p>

    <p>Then he talks about the present time, and comes to the real
    point of his discourse. He says that the wood engravers are
    more clever than ever, but I for my part see a decadence when I
    think of the time when the Graphic started. And he continues:
    &ldquo;In my opinion, the fault lies in two things, against
    which I protest. One concerns the managers and the other
    concerns the artists.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Both make mistakes, and these will spoil the thing if
    they are not corrected.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The managers, he says, ask for things that are done for
    effect; correct and honest drawing is no longer wanted,
    complete designs are no longer in demand: all that is requested
    is a &ldquo;bit&rdquo; to cover an awkward corner of a
    page.</p>

    <p>The managers declare that the public requires the
    representation of a public event or two, and is satisfied if it
    is correct and entertaining, caring nothing for the artistic
    qualities of the work.</p>

    <p>I do not believe what they say. The only excuse that can be
    accepted is &ldquo;a shortage of good
    draughtsmen.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

    <p>Then he comes to the artists, and says how he regrets that
    nowadays it is all too often the wood engraver and not the
    draughtsman who makes the pages beautiful. He urges the artists
    not to permit this, to draw soberly and vigorously, so that the
    engraver remains what he should be: the interpreter of the
    draughtsman's work, not his master.</p>

    <p>Then his conclusion follows, a strong admonition to all to
    put their hearts into the job, and not to allow themselves to
    weaken. There is a note of reproach in his voice, and he speaks
    with a certain melancholy, as if fighting against what he
    thinks unbearable indifference.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;To you - the public - art offers infinite pleasure
    and edification. It is really done for you. Therefore insist on
    good work, and you will be sure to get it,&rdquo; he
    concludes.</p>

    <p>The whole thing is thoroughly sound, strong, honest. His
    manner of speaking impresses me the same way as some of
    Millet's letters. To me it is an inspiration, and it does my
    heart good to hear someone talk this way.</p>

    <p>I say that it is a great pity there is little or no
    enthusiasm here for the art which is most suitable for the
    general public.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">If the painters combined to see that their work (which in my
    opinion is, after all, made for the people - at least I think
    this is the highest, noblest calling for any artist to pursue)
    could indeed come into the public's hands and was brought
    within everybody's reach, it could produce the same results as
    those achieved during the Graphic's first years.</label></p>

    <p>This year Neuhuys, Van der Velden and a few others made
    drawings for The Swallow, a monthly magazine which costs
    7&frac12; cents. There are some good ones among them, but one
    can see that most of them are done sloppily (not the origional
    drawings but the way of popularizing them) and I hear that this
    magazine cannot keep going any more than its predecessors. Why
    not? The booksellers say there is no profit in it, and instead
    of trying to increase the circulation, they keep it down.</p>

    <p>And I think that the painters, for their part, do not take
    the matter strongly enough to heart.</p>

    <p>The answer that many a painter here in Holland gives to the
    question &ldquo;What is a wood engraving?&rdquo; is,
    &ldquo;They are those things you find in the South Holland
    Caf&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So they class them with the drinks. And those who make them,
    perhaps with the drunkards.</p>

    <p>And what do the dealers say? Suppose I took a hundred
    sketches which I happen to have collected to any dealer here; I
    fear that the only answer I should get would be, &ldquo;Did you
    really expect <i>these things</i> to have any market
    value?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>My love and respect for the great draughtsmen, those of
    Gavarni's time as well as those of the present, increases the
    more I come to know their work, and especially since I myself
    try to make something of what one sees on the street every
    day.</p>

    <p>What I appreciate in Herkomer, Fildes, Holl and the other
    founders of the Graphic, the reason why they still mean more to
    me than Gavarni and Daumier, and will continue to, is that
    while the latter seem to look on society with malice, the
    former - as well as men like Millet, Breton, De Groux,
    Isra&euml;ls - chose subjects which are as true as Gavarni's or
    Daumier's, but have something noble and a more serious
    sentiment. That sentiment especially must remain, I think. An
    artist needn't be a clergyman or a churchwarden, but he
    certainly must have a warm heart for his fellow men. I think it
    very noble, for instance, that no winter passed without the
    Graphic doing something to arouse sympathy for the poor. For
    example, I have a page by Woodville representing a distribution
    of peat tickets in Ireland; another by Staniland called
    &ldquo;Help the Helpers,&rdquo; representing various scenes in
    a hospital which was short of money; &ldquo;Christmas in the
    Workhouse&rdquo; by Herkomer; &ldquo;Homeless and Hungry&rdquo;
    by Fildes, etc. I like them better than the drawings by
    Bertall, or the like, for the Vie El&eacute;gante.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you think this letter tedious - but it all came
    fresh into my thoughts again. <label content="psychology.depression">I had collected and mounted my
    hundred studies, and when I had finished the job, a rather
    melancholy feeling of &ldquo;what's the use?&rdquo; came over
    me. </label>But then those energetic words of Herkomer's, urging the
    public not to flag and saying that it is more necessary than
    ever to keep the hand to the plough, comforted me so, and I
    thought I would give you a short summary of what he said. A
    handshake in thought, believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I hope to hear from you soon. I had a good letter from
    home.</p>
