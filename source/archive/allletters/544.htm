  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Enclosed a very, very remarkable letter from Gauguin. Do put
    it on one side as a thing of extraordinary importance.</p>

    <p>I mean his description of himself, which moves me to the
    depths of my soul. I got it along with a letter from Bernard
    which Gauguin probably read and perhaps approved of, in which
    Bernard says once more that he wants to come here, and proposes
    to me on behalf of Laval, Monet, another novice <sup>1</sup>
    and himself to make an exchange with the four of them.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">He also says that Laval will come too, and that the other
    two want to come. I should not ask anything better, but when it
    is a question of several painters living a community life, I
    stipulate at the outset that there must be an abbot to keep
    order, and that would naturally be Gauguin. That is why I would
    like Gauguin to be here first (besides Bernard and Laval will
    only come in February - Bernard has to see his Military Board
    of Appeal in Paris).</label> As for me, I want two things, I want to
    earn back the money which I have already spent, so as to give
    it to you, and I want Gauguin to have peace and quiet in which
    to produce, and to be able to breathe freely as an artist. If I
    can get back the money already spent which you have been
    lending me for several years, we shall enlarge our enterprise,
    and try to found a studio for a renaissance and not for a
    decadence. I am pretty sure that we can count on Gauguin
    staying with us always, and that neither side will lose. Only
    by associating thus, each of us will be more himself, and union
    is strength.</p>

    <p>By the way, of course I shall not give anything to Gauguin
    in exchange for his portrait, because I think that it is sure
    to be too good, but I shall ask him to hand it over to us for
    his first month, or as payment for his fare.</p>

    <p>But you can see that if I had not written to them rather
    strongly, this portrait would not exist, and now Bernard has
    done one too.</p>

    <p>Say that I was angry, say that I was unjust, but anyway
    Gauguin has given birth to a picture, and Bernard too.</p>

    <p>Oh! <art id=0475>my study of vineyards, I have worked like a slave over
    it, but I have got it, again on a square size 30 canvas</art>, and again for the decoration of
    the house. I haven't <i>any more canvas left</i>.</p>

    <p>Do you realize that if we get Gauguin, we are at the
    beginning of a very great thing, which will open a new era for
    us.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">When I left you at the station to go South, very miserable,
    almost an invalid and almost a drunkard,</label> I still felt vaguely
    that we had put our very heart into our discussions with so
    many interesting people and artists that winter, but I hadn't
    the courage to hope.</p>

    <p>After continued efforts on your part and mine, now at last
    something is beginning to show on the horizon: Hope.</p>

    <p>It does not matter if you stay with the Goupils or not, you
    have committed yourself to Gauguin body and soul.</p>

    <p>So you will be one of the first, or the first
    dealer-apostle. I can see my own painting coming to life, and
    likewise a work among the artists. For if you try to get money
    for us, I shall urge every man who comes within my reach to
    produce, and I will set them an example myself.</p>

    <p>And if we stick to it, all this will help to make something
    more lasting than ourselves.</p>

    <p>I have to answer Gauguin and Bernard this afternoon, and I
    am going to say to them that in any case we shall begin by
    feeling wholly united, and that I for one am confident that
    this union will be our strength against the inevitable
    deficiencies of money and health.</p>

    <p>Do go and see Thomas in spite of everything, because before
    Gauguin comes I want to buy some more things - the
    following:</p>

    <p>Dressing table and chest of drawers 40 fr.</p>

    <p>4 Sheets 40</p>

    <p>3 Drawing boards 12</p>

    <p>Kitchen range 60</p>

    <p>Paints and canvas 200</p>

    <p>Frames and stretchers 50</p>

    <p>There, it's a lot, and nothing of it is absolutely
    essential. We can do without any item. But all the same, the
    broader and more lasting character which I want this business
    to have demands it. For instance the four extra sheets - I have
    four already - we shall even be able to put Bernard up for
    nothing if we put a straw pallet or mattress on the floor
    either for me or for him, just as we like. The kitchen range
    will warm the studio for us at the same time.</p>

    <p>But you will say - &ldquo;And these paints?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, yes, I am ashamed of it, but I am vain enough to want
    to make a certain impression on Gauguin with my work, so I
    cannot help wanting to do as much work as possible alone before
    he comes. His coming will alter my manner of painting and I
    shall gain by it, I believe, but all the same I am rather keen
    on my decorations, which are almost like French painted
    porcelain. And these days are magnificent.</p>

    <p>I am working on ten size 30 canvases now.</p>

    <p>Over and above all this we have to add Gauguin's fare, but
    if Thomas isn't willing to be free-handed, <i>Gauguin's fare
    comes before everything else</i>, to the detriment of your
    pocket and mine. <i>Before everything else</i>. All the
    expenses I have mentioned are only meant to make a good
    impression on him at the moment he arrives. I would like him to
    feel it all harmonious, and I wish that we could have managed -
    you by your money and I with a general effect and the
    arrangement of things - to have the studio complete, and a
    setting worthy of the artist Gauguin who is to be its head.</p>

    <p>It would be a good stroke, like the old days when Corot,
    finding Daumier on the rocks, made life so secure for him that
    he found everything easy, but it will do very well even as
    things are.</p>

    <p>The essential thing is the fare, and even my paints can
    wait, though I venture to think that I shall someday earn more
    with them than they cost. I shouldn't make light of Gauguin's
    giving you the monopoly of his work, and straight off his
    prices will go up. Nothing below 500 frs. He only needs
    confidence, and now he will have it. I feel that we are working
    in a great and good enterprise, which has nothing to do with
    the old kind of commerce.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">As for the colours, it is <i>almost certain</i> that with
    Gauguin here, we shall bray them ourselves. I have painted the
    vines again entirely with Tanguy's paints, and they are
    satisfactory, the coarser grain is in no way troublesome.</label> If we
    go on attacking things in the right way, I mean from the human,
    not the material side, it seems to me not altogether out of the
    question that the material difficulties may smooth themselves
    out. Because one grows in the storm. I am going on framing
    studies, because it all goes to make part of the furnishing,
    and gives character to the place.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">If Gauguin gives his work to you, officially because you are
    with the Goupils and privately as your friend and under an
    obligation to you, then in return Gauguin can consider himself
    head of the studio, and control the money as he thinks fit, and
    if it can be done, help Bernard, Laval and others by exchanging
    studies or pictures, while I shall abide by the same
    conditions, giving my studies for 100 francs and my share of
    the canvas and paints. But the more Gauguin realizes that when
    he joins us he will have the standing of head of the studio,
    the sooner he will get better, and the more eager he will be to
    work.</label></p>

    <p>Now the more complete the studio, and the more solidly
    established it is for the use of those who are passing through,
    the more inspiration he will have, and ambition to make it a
    living force. They are talking of nothing else at the moment at
    Pont-Aven, which means that Paris will be talking too, and once
    again, the more solidly established it is, so much the better
    will the general impression be, and the greater the chance that
    it will catch on.</p>

    <p>Well, what will be, will be. Only I say now, to prevent
    future discussions, if it catches on so that Laval and Bernard
    will really come, Gauguin and not I will be the head of the
    studio. As for the internal arrangements, I think that we shall
    agree pretty well.</p>

    <p>I hope I shall get your next letter on Wednesday. Bernard's
    letter is once more full of his conviction that Gauguin is a
    very great master, and a man absolutely superior in character
    and intellect.</p>

    <p>A good handshake, and good-by for now.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>The Vineyard that I have just painted is green, purple and
    yellow, with violet bunches and branches in black and
    orange.</p>

    <p>On the horizon are some blue-grey willows, and the wine
    press a long, long way off, with a red roof, and the lilac
    silhouette of the distant town.</p>

    <p>In the vineyard there are little figures of women with red
    parasols, and other little figures of men working at gathering
    grapes with their cart.</p>

    <p>Over it is a blue sky, and the foreground is of grey sand.
    This is a pendant to the garden with the clipped bush and the
    oleanders.</p>

    <p>I think you will prefer these ten canvases to the batch I
    sent last, and I venture to hope to double the number in the
    autumn.</p>

    <p>Day after day it grows richer and richer. And when the
    leaves start to fall - I do not know if this happens in the
    beginning of November here the way it does with us - when all
    the foliage is yellow, it will be amazing against the blue.</p>

    <p>Zeim has given us that splendour many a time already. Then a
    short winter, and after that we shall have got to the orchards
    in bloom again.</p>

    <p>What Gauguin says about &ldquo;Persian&rdquo; painting is
    true. I don't believe that it would shock anybody in the
    Dieulafoi Museum, one might put it there without any
    difficulties. But, but, but&hellip;I myself do not belong to
    the world of the great, not even to any world at
    all&hellip;and&hellip;I prefer the Greeks and Japanese to the
    Persians and Egyptians. All the same, I do not mean to say that
    Gauguin is wrong in working in the Persian style.</p>

    <p>But I should have to get used to it.</p>
