  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your last letter, which I received at the same
    time as one from Etten. So you are back at work again; do
    whatever your hand finds to do with all your strength, and a
    blessing is certain. How I should have loved to accompany you
    on that walk to the Heike and to Sprundel in the first
    snow.</p>

    <p>Father wrote me: &ldquo;in the afternoon I had to go to the
    Hoeve. Mother had ordered a carriage, but they could not drive
    because the horses could not yet be calked; so I resolved to go
    on foot and that kind Uncle Jan would not let me go alone, but
    went with me. It was an uncomfortable expedition, but Uncle Jan
    rightly observed: The devil is never so black but you can look
    him in the face. We arrived and returned home safely, though
    there was a storm with sleet, so that the road was slippery as
    ice. It was delightful beyond words to sit comfortably together
    in a nice warm room in the evening and to rest after
    labour.&rdquo; Shall we also go together like that to some
    church someday, being sorrowful yet always rejoicing, with an
    eternal joy in our hearts because we are the poor in the
    Kingdom of God? God grant it.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday evening I went to a village on the Thames called
    Petersham In the morning I had been at the Sunday school in
    Turnham Green, and after sunset I went from there to Richmond
    and then to Petersham. Soon it became dark, and I did not know
    the right way. It was a terribly muddy road, on top of a sort
    of dike, the slope of which was covered with gnarled elm trees
    and bushes. At last I saw a light in a little house somewhere
    below the dike, and climbed and waded through the mud to reach
    it; there they showed me the right way. But, boy, there was a
    beautiful little wooden church with a kindly light at the end
    of that dark road. I read Acts 5:14 - 16 and Acts 12:5 - 17,
    Peter in prison; and then I told the story of John and
    Theogenes once more. A harmonium in the church was played by a
    young lady from the boarding school, the pupils of which were
    all there.</p>

    <p>In the morning it was so beautiful on the road to Turnham
    Green - the chestnut trees and the clear blue sky and the
    morning sun mirrored in the water of the Thames; the grass was
    sparkling green and one heard the sound of church bells all
    around.</p>

    <p>The day before I had made a long hike to London. I left here
    at four o'clock in the morning, and at half-past six was in
    Hyde park. There the dew was lying on the grass and the leaves
    were falling from the trees; in the distance one saw the pale
    lights of the lamps which had not yet been put out, and the
    towers of Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, and
    the sun rose red in the morning mist. From there I went to
    Whitechapel, the poor part of London; to Chancery Lane and
    Westminster; to Clapham to visit Mrs. Loyer again, whose
    birthday was the day before. I also went to Mr. Obach's to see
    his wife and children again.</p>

    <p>Then I went to Lewisham, where I arrived at the Gladwells at
    half-past three. It was exactly three months since I had been
    there on that Saturday when their little daughter was buried. I
    spent about three hours with them, and we shared many thoughts,
    too many for expression. From there I also wrote to Harry in
    Paris. I hope you will meet him someday; it may easily happen
    that you, too, will go to Paris. At half-past ten in the
    evening I was back here, having used the underground railway
    part of the way. I had been lucky enough to collect some money
    for Mr. Jones.</p>

    <p>At Petersham, I warned the community that it was going to
    hear bad English, but that when I spoke I thought of the man in
    the parable who said: &ldquo;Have patience with me, I will pay
    you fully.&rdquo; Would that God comes to my assistance! At Mr.
    Obach's I saw the picture, or rather sketch, by Boughton,
    &ldquo;The Pilgrim's Progress.&rdquo; If you ever have an
    opportunity to read Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, you will find
    it greatly worth while. For my part I am exceedingly fond of
    it. It is nighttime, I am still writing, copying something for
    the Gladwells at Lewisham, etc.; one must strike the iron while
    it is still hot, and the heart of man when it is burning within
    him.</p>

    <p>A firm handshake, kind regards to Mr. and Mrs. Tersteeg and
    to the Roos, Haanebeek, Van Stockum and Mauve families.
    &Agrave; Dieu, believe me,</p>

    <p>Your most affectionate brother, Vincent</p>
