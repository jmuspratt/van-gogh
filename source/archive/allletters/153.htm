  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>There is something on my mind that I want to tell you about.
    You may perhaps know something of it already and it will not be
    news to you. <label content="feelings.love">I wanted to let you know that I fell so much in
    love with Kee Vos this summer that I can find no other words
    for it than, &ldquo;It is just as if Kee Vos were the closest
    person to me and I the closest person to Kee Vos,&rdquo; and -
    those words I spoke to her. But when I told her this, she
    replied that her past and her future remained as one to her so
    that she could never return my feelings.</label></p>

    <p>Then I was in a tremendous dilemma about what to do. Should
    I resign myself to that &ldquo;never, no, never,&rdquo; or
    consider the matter not yet settled and done with, keep in good
    heart and not give up?</p>

    <p>I chose the latter. And to this day I do not regret this
    approach, although I am still up against that `never, no,
    never'. Since then, of course, I have had to put up with quite
    a few &ldquo;petites mis&egrave;res de la vie humaine,&rdquo;
    [life's little troubles] which, had they been written
    about in a book, might well have served to amuse some people,
    but which if one experiences them oneself must be deemed
    anything but pleasant.</p>

    <p>However, to this day I am glad that I left the resignation -
    or the &ldquo;how not to do it&rdquo; method - to those who
    have a mind for it and for myself kept in good heart. You will
    understand that in case like this it is surprisingly difficult
    to tell what one can, may and must do. Yet `we pick up the
    scent as we wander about, not as we sit idly by.'</p>

    <p>One of the reasons why I have not written to you about all
    this before is that my position was so uncertain and unsettled
    that I was unable to explain it to you. Now, however, we have
    reached the point where I have spoken about it, not only to her
    but to Father and Mother, to Uncle and Aunt Stricker and to our
    Uncle and Aunt at Prinsenhage.</p>

    <p>The only one to say to me, and that very informally and
    privately, that there really might be a chance for me if I
    worked hard and made progress, was someone from whom I least
    expected it: Uncle Cent. He was pleased with the way in which I
    reacted to Kee's never no, never, that is not making heavy
    weather of it but taking it in quite good humour, and said for
    instance, 'Don't give grist to the never, no, never mills which
    Kee has set up, I wish her all the best, but I rather hope
    those mills will go bankrupt.'</p>

    <p>Similarly, I didn't take it amiss when Uncle Stricker said
    that there was the danger that I 'might be severing friendly
    relationships and old ties'. Whereupon I said that in my view
    the real issue, far from severing old ties, was to see if the
    old ones could not be renewed where they were in need of
    repair.</p>

    <p>Anyway, that is what I hope to go on doing, and cast out
    despondency and gloom, meanwhile working hard - and ever since
    I met her, I have been getting on much better with my work.</p>

    <p>I told you that the position has now become more clear cut.
    1<sup>st</sup>. - Kee says never, no, never and then - I have
    the feeling that I'm going to have an immense amount of
    difficulty with the older people, who consider the matter
    settled and done with now and will try to force me to drop
    it.</p>

    <p>For the time being, however, I think they'll go about it
    very gently, keeping me dangling and fobbing me off with fair
    words until Uncle and Aunt Stricker's big celebration (in
    December) is over [their silver wedding]. I fear they will be
    taking measures to get rid of me.</p>

    <p>Forgive me for expressing myself somewhat harshly in order
    to make the position clear to you. I admit that the colours are
    somewhat glaring and the lines somewhat starkly drawn, but that
    will give you a clearer insight into the affair than if I were
    to beat about the bush. So do not suspect me of lacking in
    respect for the older people.</p>

    <p>However, I do believe that they are positively
    <i>against</i> it and I wanted to make that clear to you. They
    will try to make sure that Kee and I neither see or speak or
    write to each other, because they know very well that if we
    saw, spoke or wrote to each other, there would be a chance of
    Kee changing her mind. Kee herself thinks she will never change
    her mind, the older people are trying to convince me that she
    cannot change it, and yet they fear such a change.</p>

    <p>The older people will change their minds about this affair,
    not when Kee changes her attitude but when I have become
    somebody who earns at least 1000 guilders a year. Once again,
    forgive me the hard contours with which I am outlining matters.
    If I receive a little sympathy from the older ones, I believe
    that some of the younger ones will be able to understand my
    position.</p>

    <p>You may, Theo - you may hear it said of me that I want to
    force things, and expressions like that. Yet everyone knows how
    senseless force is in love. No, nothing is further from my
    thoughts.</p>

    <p>But it is neither unfair nor unreasonable to wish that Kee
    and I, instead of not being allowed any contact with each
    other, might see, speak or write to each other so that we could
    come to know each other better, and even be able to tell
    whether or not we are suited to one another. A year of keeping
    in touch with each other would be salutary for her and for me,
    and yet the older people have really dug in their heels on this
    point. Were I rich, they would soon change their tune.</p>

    <p>But now you will realize that I hope to leave no stone
    unturned that might bring me closer to her, and that is my
    intention:</p>

    <p>To go on loving her</p>

    <p>Until in the end she loves me too.</p>

    <p>Plus elle disparait plus elle apparait. [The more she
    disappears the more she appears.]</p>

    <p>Theo, are you by any chance in love as well? I hope you are,
    for believe me, even its `petites mis&egrave;res' have their
    value. One is sometimes in despair, there are moments when one
    is in hell, so to speak, yet there is also something different
    and better about it.</p>

    <p>There are three stages.</p>

    <p>1. Not loving and not being loved.</p>

    <p>2. Loving and not being loved (the present case).</p>

    <p>3. Loving and being loved.</p>

    <p>Now, I tell you that the second stage is better than the
    first, but the third! That's <i>it</i>!</p>

    <p>Well, old boy, go and fall in love yourself and tell me
    about it some time. Keep your own counsel in the present case
    and have some sympathy for me. Of course I would much rather
    have had a yea and amen, but I am almost pleased with my
    'never, no, never'. (I take it for <i>something</i>, although
    older and wiser heads say it is <i>nothing</i>.)</p>

    <p>Rappard has been here, and brought some watercolours that
    are coming on well. Mauve will be calling soon, I hope,
    otherwise I shall go to him. I am doing a good deal of drawing
    and have the feeling it is improving; I am working much more
    with the brush than before. It is so cold now that I do almost
    nothing but indoor figure-drawing, a seamstress, a
    basket-weaver, etc.</p>

    <p>A handshake in my thoughts and write soon and believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>If you ever do fall in love and get a never, no, never,
    don't resign yourself to it whatever you do! But you are such a
    lucky dog that nothing like that will ever happen to you, I
    hope.</p>

    <p>They tried to make me promise that I would speak or write
    absolutely nothing more about this business, but I refused to
    promise that. In my opinion no one in the world should in
    fairness demand such a thing of me (or of anyone else in the
    same position.) All I did was to give Uncle Cent the assurance
    that for the time being I would cease writing to Uncle Stricker
    unless unforeseen circumstances should necessitate it. A lark
    cannot help singing in the spring.</p>
