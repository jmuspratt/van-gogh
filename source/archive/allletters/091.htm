    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I must send you another letter; as you see, I am writing
    from Etten.</p>

    <p>Yesterday morning I received a letter from home in which
    Father wrote that Aerssen was dying and that he had been to see
    him, as Aerssen had expressed the wish that Father should visit
    him. At this news my heart was drawn so strongly towards
    Zundert that I longed to go there also.</p>

    <p>But more about this later. I have just read your last
    letter, from which I see that your trip is over and you are
    back in The Hague. Please write again soon, and let us stay
    close together.</p>

    <p>Today I received a postcard from Anna, saying she arrived
    safely; may she do well. Has it struck you, too, that something
    has come over her that makes you think of the woman who loved
    Jesus, of whom the Bible speaks? And thinking of her, I am
    reminded again and again of B&eacute;ranger's words:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Dans les palais et sous le chaume,<br>

    Dit la Vierge, j'ai de mes mains<br>

    Pr&eacute;par&eacute; le miel et le baume<br>

    Pour les souffrances des humains.<br>

    <p></p>

    [In the palaces and under the thatch,<br>

    The Virgin says, I have prepared<br>

    With my own hands the honey and balsam<br>

    For human sufferings.]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p><label content="attitude.sisters">And how sweet she was with that family at Welwyn, sharing
    their happiness and misfortune, and never withholding any help
    or comfort that was within her; also in the days that child
    fell ill and died. I have seen so clearly how they all loved
    her. From the very beginning she exerted herself to the utmost,
    rising early in winter to light the fire with her own hands,
    even though the first days were not easy for her, and she wrote
    she often thought, &ldquo;Without Thou, O Eternal Being, Ah,
    what would man be on this earth; Who is there in heaven but
    Thou; Nought delights me any more on earth but Thou.&rdquo;
    <sup>1</sup> And how she looked forward to Communion, and went
    to it, and was fortified by it. And how Pa and Mother love her,
    as, indeed, we all do; ay, let us stay close together.</label></p>

    <p>Saturday night I took the last train from Dordrecht to
    Oudenbosch, and walked from there to Zundert. It was so
    beautiful on the heath; though it was dark, one could
    distinguish the heath and the pine woods and moors extending
    far and wide - it reminded me of the Bodmer print hanging in
    Father's study. The sky was overcast, but the evening star was
    shining through the clouds, and now and then more stars
    appeared. It was very early when I arrived at the churchyard in
    Zundert; everything was so quiet. I went over all the dear old
    spots, and the little paths, and waited for the sunrise there.
    You know the story of the Resurrection - everything reminded me
    of it that morning in the quiet graveyard.</p>

    <p>Having arrived at Aerssen's house, I heard from young
    Aerssen and Mientje, as soon as they had got up, that their
    father had died that night - oh! They were so grieved, and
    their hearts were so full. Hein also came very early in the
    morning. I was glad to be with them, and I shared their
    feelings, for I too had loved the man.</p>

    <p>The aunts send you their love, as well as Jan Doome, whom I
    also visited. From there I walked with Hein to Rijsbergen and
    spent about an hour in the house; we read the Bible together.
    Woutje Prins <sup>2</sup> had also sat up with Aerssen three
    nights, and had been with him to the last.<label content="attitude.death"> His passing was
    peaceful. I shall never forget that noble head lying on the
    pillow: the face showed signs of suffering, but wore an
    expression of peace and a certain holiness. Oh! It was so
    beautiful, to me it was characteristic of all the peculiar
    charm of the country and the life of the Brabant people.</label> And
    they were all talking about Father, how good he had always
    been, and how much these two had loved each other.</p>

    <p>Then I walked with Hein Aerssen to Etten, and I am home now,
    ready to start for Dordrecht early tomorrow morning.</p>

    <p>Good-by, brother, it is mail time; a firm handshake and kind
    regards to all, from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
