    <p>Vincent van Gogh, and some personal reminiscences of him, by
    D. Gestel:</p>

    <p>&hellip;Besides the three aforesaid amateurs [Hermans,
    Kerssemakers and Van de Wakker, see Letter 453c], and Jan
    Bayens in Rechte Street, at whose shop he bought his colours,
    Vincent also occasionally visited other inhabitants of
    Eindhoven, among others the goldsmith Driek van Gardinghe, and
    Van der Sande, organist of St. Catherine's Church.</p>

    <p>Toon Kers <sup>1</sup> and Van de Wakker had already told me
    how conscientiously Vincent studied the theory of colours in
    books by Delacroix and others, who also tried to demonstrate a
    connection between colours and music. I was told that Vincent
    attached much importance to this, and that he wanted to
    convince himself personally of the connection there might exist
    between colours and musical tones, for which reason he went and
    took piano lessons from Van der Sande.</p>

    <p>Once Vincent also walked into our printing establishment,
    and asked for printer's ink. Afterward he often returned for
    it, and on one of these occasions he asked for a small
    lithographic stone. After some time he returned with it, after
    he had drawn on it a copy of his painting, &ldquo;The Potato
    Eaters,&rdquo; with lithographic crayon&hellip;</p>

    <p>On the occasion of this visit to our printing shop Vincent
    saw some paintings I had done. At the time I was still living
    at Amsterdam, where I was qualifying for my secondary Drawing
    Master's certificate. He passed by all my academic work,
    including Greek sculptures and Roman Caesars, but a painted
    study of a still life, which I did when I was sixteen years
    old, struck him. He said he found promise in it, and he advised
    my parents to remove me from the academy, and not to let me
    take any examinations. At any rate they were to send me to
    Nuenen as soon as I next came home.</p>

    <p>I complied with this request in the summer of 1884, and so
    on a Sunday afternoon I set out for Nuenen in the company of my
    brother and our lithographic printer.</p>

    <p>We were received by Vincent in his studio, which he had in
    the house of the sexton of the Roman Catholic Church at
    Nuenen&hellip;<label content="lifestyle.appearance">There he was standing before us, that short,
    square-built little man, called by the rustics &ldquo;het
    schildermenneke,&rdquo; &ldquo;the little painter
    fellow.&rdquo; His sunburned, weather-beaten face was framed in
    a somewhat red and stubbly beard. His eyes were slightly
    inflamed, probably from his painting in the sun. If it had not
    been Sunday, he would certainly have been wearing his blue
    blouse. Now he was dressed in a short, thick pea jacket, the
    kind bargemen generally wear. While he was talking about his
    work, he mostly kept his arms folded across his chest.</label></p>

    <p>Time had been flying remarkably fast during this interesting
    summer afternoon at Nuenen. Toward evening twilight Vincent
    took us around the village. We turned into the narrow path
    behind the pastor's house, and soon we reached the old, squat
    tower and the small churchyard&hellip;After we had seen some
    fine picturesque homesteads, it was time to start on our walk
    back to Eindhoven. It was a beautiful summer night, and Vincent
    accompanied us as far as the Opwetten water mill. When taking
    leave, Vincent invited me to come back soon, and, consistent
    with his energetic way of doing things, he insisted on
    immediately making an appointment for me to take the first
    train to Nuenen the very next morning. And I was to take my
    tools along with me. Vincent would come and meet me at the
    little station, and after that we should go together to the
    heath to paint studies.</p>

    <p>Next morning, before daybreak, I arrived at what was called
    the Eeneind (the One End) where the train had taken me, and I
    was looking out over the wide fields, hardly visible in the dim
    light, to see whether my new master was coming.</p>
