  <body>
    <p>My dear Bernard,</p>

    <p>You do very well to be reading the Bible. I begin with that,
    because I have always refrained from advising you to do so. As
    I read the many sayings of Moses, Luke, etc., I couldn't help
    thinking, you know, that's all he needs - and now it has come
    to pass&hellip;the artistic neurosis. For that is what the
    study of Christ inevitably leads to, especially in my case,
    where it is aggravated by the smoking of innumerable pipes.</p>

    <p>The Bible is Christ, for the Old Testament leads to that
    culmination. Paul and the evangelists stand on the other slope
    of the holy mountain.</p>

    <p>How small-minded the old story really is! My God! Does the
    world consist solely of Jews, who declare from the very start
    that all those who are different from them are impure?</p>

    <p>Why didn't the other nations under the great sun over there,
    the Egyptians, the Indians, the Ethiopians, Babylon and
    Nineveh, record their annals with the same care? Well, anyway,
    the study of it is beautiful, and, after all, being able to
    read everything would be tantamount to not being able to read
    at all.</p>

    <p>But the consolation of that deeply saddening Bible, which
    arouses our despair and indignation, which seriously offends us
    and thoroughly confuses us with its pettiness and infectious
    foolishness - the consolation it contains like a stone inside a
    hard rind and bitter pulp, is Christ.</p>

    <p>Only Delacroix and Rembrandt have painted the face of Christ
    in such a way that I can feel him&hellip;and then Millet
    painted&hellip;the teachings of Christ.</p>

    <p>The rest rather makes me laugh, the rest of religious
    painting - from the religious point of view, not from the point
    of view of painting. And the Italian primitives - Botticelli,
    or let's say the Flemish primitives, Van Eyck, the German,
    Cranach - they are no more than heathens who only interest me
    for the same reason as do the Greeks, Vel&aacute;squez and so
    many other naturalists.</p>

    <p>Christ alone, of all the philosophers, magicians, etc., has
    affirmed eternal life as the most important certainty, the
    infinity of time, the futility of death, the necessity and
    purpose of serenity and devotion. He lived serenely, <i>as an
    artist greater than all other artists</i>, scorning marble and
    clay and paint, working in the living flesh. In other words,
    this peerless artist, scarcely conceivable with the blunt
    instrument of our modern, nervous and obtuse brains, made
    neither statues nor paintings nor books. He maintained in no
    uncertain terms that he made&hellip;<i>living men</i>,
    immortals.</p>

    <p>That is a profoundly serious matter, the more so as it is
    the truth.</p>

    <p>Nor did this great artist write books. Christian literature
    as a whole would undoubtedly have aroused his ire, and includes
    very few literary works beyond Luke's Gospel or Paul's epistles
    - so simple in their austere and militant form - that would
    have found favour in his eyes.</p>

    <p>This great artist - Christ - although he did not concern
    himself with writing books on ideas (sensations), felt
    considerably less disdain for the spoken word, and for parables
    in particular (what a sower, what a harvest, what a fig tree!
    etc.).</p>

    <p>And who would dare claim that he lied on that day when,
    scornfully predicting the destruction of Rome, he said,
    &ldquo;Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not
    pass away.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>These spoken words - which, like a prodigal grand seigneur,
    he did not even deign to write down - form one of the
    pinnacles, the highest pinnacle, reached by art, which at that
    point becomes creative force, pure creative force.</p>

    <p>These thoughts, Bernard, dear friend, lead us far, very far,
    afield, they raise us above art itself. They give us a glimpse
    of the art of life-creation, the art of being immortal and
    alive. They are bound up with painting. The patron saint of
    painters - Luke, physician, painter, evangelist - who has as a
    symbol, alas, nothing more than an ox, gives us hope.</p>

    <p>Yet our own life is a modest one indeed, our life as
    painters, languishing under the back-breaking yoke of the
    problems of a calling that is almost too hard to practise on
    this ungrateful planet, where &ldquo;love of art drives out
    true love.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>However, since nothing confutes the assumption that lines
    and forms and colours exist on innumerable other planets and
    suns as well, we are at liberty to feel fairly serene about the
    possibilities of painting in a better and different existence,
    an existence altered by a phenomenon that is perhaps no more
    ingenious and no more surprising than the transformation of a
    caterpillar into a butterfly or of a grub into a maybug.</p>

    <p>The existence of a painter-butterfly would be played out on
    the countless celestial bodies which, after death, should be no
    more inaccessible to us than the black dots on maps that
    symbolize towns and villages are in our earthly lives.</p>

    <p>Science - scientific reasoning - strikes me as being an
    instru-ment that will go a very long way in the future.</p>

    <p>For look: people used to think that the earth was flat. That
    was true, and still is today, of, say, Paris to
    Asni&egrave;res.</p>

    <p>But that does not alter the fact that science demonstrates
    that the earth as a whole is round, something nobody nowadays
    disputes.</p>

    <p>For all that, people still persist in thinking that <i>life
    is flat</i> and runs from birth to death.</p>

    <p>But life, too, is probably round, and much greater in scope
    and possibilities than the hemisphere we now know.</p>

    <p>Future generations will probably be able to enlighten us on
    this very interesting subject, and then science itself - with
    all due respect - may reach conclusions that are more or less
    in keeping with Christ's sayings about the other half of our
    life.</p>

    <p>Be that as it may, the fact is that we are painters in real
    life, and it's a matter of continuing to draw breath while one
    has breath left in one's body.</p>

    <p>Oh, what a beautiful picture that is by Eug. Delacroix,
    <art id=elacroix>Christ in the Boat on the Sea of Gennesaret! He - with his pale
    lemon-yellow aureole, sleeping, luminous in the dramatic
    purple, dark-blue, blood-red patch of the group of bewildered
    disciples - on that terrible emerald-green sea, rising, rising,
    right to the top of the frame.</art> Ah, what an inspired conception!
    <label content="health.fatigue">I would do a sketch of it for you, but because I've been
    drawing and painting a model - a Zouave - for three or four
    days now, I am all in. Writing, on the other hand, calms and
    diverts me.</label></p>

    <p>What I've been doing looks very ugly - <art id=1443>a drawing of a seated
    Zouave</art>, a <art id=0424>painted sketch of the Zouave
    against a completely white wall</art>, and finally
    <art id=0423>his portrait against a green door and some orange bricks in a
    wall</art>. It is harsh, and taking it all in all,
    ugly and unsuccessful. Yet, because I was tackling a real
    difficulty with it, it may pave the way for the future.</p>

    <p>Nearly all the figures I do look abominable in my own eyes,
    let alone the eyes of others. Yet the study of the figure is
    the most useful of all, provided one does it in a different way
    from that taught at, for instance, Monsieur Benjamin
    Constant's.</p>

    <p>Your letter pleased me very much, the sketch <sup>1</sup> is
    very, very interesting, and I thank you very much for it. One
    of these days I shall be sending you a drawing of mine.<label content="health.fatigue"> Tonight
    I am too exhausted, my eyes are tired even if my mind is
    not.</label></p>

    <p>Tell me, do you remember the John the Baptist by Puvis? I
    find it staggeringly beautiful and as magical as Eugene
    Delacroix.</p>

    <p>The passage about John the Baptist you tracked down in the
    Gospel means exactly what you have read in it&hellip; people
    crowding round a man: &ldquo;Are you the Christ? Are you
    Elias?&rdquo; As would happen today if you were to ask of
    impressionism or of one of its questing representatives,
    &ldquo;Have you found it yet?&rdquo; Exactly the same.</p>

    <p>My brother is holding an exhibition of Claude Monets, 10
    paintings done in Antibes from February to May, apparently it's
    all very beautiful.</p>

    <p>Have you ever read the life of Luther? Because Cranach,
    D&uuml;rer, Holbein belong with him. He - his personality - is
    the shining light of the Middle Ages.</p>

    <p>I don't like the Sun King any more than you do - that Louis
    XIV was rather a killjoy, it seems to me - my God, what an
    utter bore that Methodist Solomon was. I don't like Solomon
    either and Methodists not at all. Solomon strikes me as a
    hypocritical heathen. I have really no respect for his
    architecture, an imitation of other styles, and none at all for
    his writings, for the heathens have done better.</p>

    <p>Do tell me how things are going with your military service.
    Do you want me to speak to that second lieutenant in the
    Zouaves or not? Are you going to Africa or not? Do the years in
    Africa count double in your case or not? Try to make sure above
    all that your blood is all right - anaemia doesn't get you very
    far and your painting slows right down. You must try to acquire
    an iron constitution, a constitution that will allow you to
    grow old, you ought to live like a monk who goes to the brothel
    every two weeks - that's what I do myself, it isn't very
    poetic, but I feel it's my duty to subordinate my life to
    painting.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">If I were at the Louvre with you, what I should very much
    like would be to go and see the primitives in your company. I
    still go, full of love, to look at the Dutch in the Louvre,
    Rembrandt first, Rembrandt, whom I used to study so much - and
    then, say, Potter, who paints a white stallion done in a meadow
    on a size 4 or 6 panel - a stallion neighing and aroused -
    forlorn under a heavy thundery sky, inconsolable in the soft
    green immensity of the damp meadow. In short, there are marvels
    among the old Dutchmen which cannot be compared to anything
    else.</label></p>

    <p>With a handshake, and once again thanks for your letter and
    your sketch,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>P.S. The sonnets are doing well - that is to say, their
    colour is fine; the drawing is less strong, or rather less
    sure, the drawing is still hesitant - I don't know how to
    express it - their moral purpose is not clear.</p>
