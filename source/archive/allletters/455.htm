  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am longing very much to hear from you, for the time has
    come for me to make a decision.</p>

    <p>There are only ten days left in the month, and I have to
    know what I must do. However, for myself, I have come to a
    decision. I only wish you would see things as I do.</p>

    <p>If you approve of the plan of my coming to Paris as soon as
    possible, then after having been in Brabant for a short time, I
    shall send you from here the studies and drawings I have
    here.</p>

    <p>But I must hasten to send them, otherwise I shall have to
    stay here longer again.</p>

    <p><label content="health.dental">I should also like so very much to finish having my teeth
    fixed. </label>What must I do?</p>

    <p>I have a total of one franc fifty centimes left, and as to
    my food, I paid 5 francs in advance until the end of the
    month.</p>

    <p>In so many ways it would be such a good thing to change
    soon.</p>

    <p>You understand that no money is left to take painting
    materials from here to Brabant, so I shall be doubly in a fix
    there, both as to models and colours.</p>

    <p>So there is no choice; besides, what need is there to
    choose? For what is most pressing must come first, and that is
    the period of drawing from the nude and the works of
    antiquity.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I write you somewhat abruptly, but things must not
    be put off. For the rest, it is only natural that there cannot
    be any objection to finding a garret in Paris at once, on the
    very first day of my arrival, and then I can go and draw at the
    Louvre or the Ecole des Beaux-Arts so that I shall be quite
    prepared for Cormon. So don't let's hesitate or take too long
    to decide.</p>

    <p>We must put our shoulders to the wheel. Well, let's do
    it.</p>

    <p>If ever we want to do some good, you may be sure that more
    and more things will depend on quickness and resoluteness of
    action, and as, notwithstanding all the trouble one may take,
    nobody can be sure of the result of his undertaking, there can
    be no harm in some daring and energy.</p>

    <p>So if it were at all possible, <label content="health.dental">I should like to have that
    job on my teeth finished this month. </label>I should like to pack up
    my studies and send them to you, and then leave here on the
    last of this month, or even a few days sooner.</p>

    <p>But not stay on into March, on account of the rent.</p>

    <p>Would this be possible? Then I can help them to pack up at
    home, if it should be of any use to them. And if I can paint or
    draw a little there, so much the better. But the sooner and the
    more energetically we go through that period of drawing in
    Paris, the better it will be for the whole future; I feel even
    the little I did of it these last few weeks here has been of
    use to me. And if I did not do so, and tried another way,
    direct from nature, I should always have trouble with people
    who had been at some academy, who would say that according to
    them I cannot draw.</p>

    <p>I do not know definitely yet how things will go with me here
    at the academy. I think I wrote you recently, didn't I, that
    they absolutely <i>picked</i> a fight with me?</p>

    <p>Yesterday I heard that Sibert, the teacher, had said to
    somebody that I had a good idea of drawing, and that he had
    been rather too hasty.</p>

    <p>As he does not come into the class often, I have not seen
    him for a few days.</p>

    <p>At the moment I am working on a woman's torso.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, do write as soon as you can. My health remains
    pretty much the same, yet I believe it is beginning to
    improve.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>If I did not insist on it, i.e. going to Paris, I should not
    recover, for I must try to earn more. I am living too
    wretchedly now. If one didn't have to pay for so many other
    things, one could live very well on 150 fr., but now there are
    too many things to pay for.</p>

    <p>But after all, my health is improving, and it will come out
    all right.</p>
