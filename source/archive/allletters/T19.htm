    <p>Letter T19<br>
     Paris, 21 October 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Enclosed please find 150 francs for Mr. Peyron and for your
    travelling expenses to Arles. In my letters to Mr. Peyron I
    said that he should tell me if there are any supplementary
    expenses, but he never said a word about it. So be kind enough
    to ask him to let me know every time he acknowledges receipt of
    my monthly letter if there is anything owing him; in this way
    the bill will not mount up. <sup>1</sup> I hope you are still
    in good health, and that you are having luck with your work. I
    have had quite a number of people calling on me to see your
    work. Isra&euml;l's son, who is staying in Paris for
    some time; Veth, a Dutchman who paints portraits, and who
    writes in the Nieuve Gids, <sup>2</sup> that periodical you may
    have heard some talk about - it rouses the indignation of so
    many people but there are often good things in it; and then Van
    Rysselberghe, one of the Vingtistes of Brussels. The latter
    also saw everything there is at Tangui's, and your pictures
    seem to interest him quite a lot.</p>

    <p>In Belgium people are already more accustomed to colourful
    painting; in this respect the exhibition of the
    &ldquo;XX&rdquo; has done a great deal of good, although they
    are buying nothing over there. The exhibition of the
    Independents is over and I've got <art id=0608>your irises back</art>; it is
    one of your good things. It seems to me that you
    are stronger when you paint true things like that, or like <art id=0478a>the
    stagecoach at Tarascon</art>, or the head of a
    child, or <art id=0609>the underbrush with the ivy in vertical format</art>. The
    form is so well defined, and the whole is full of colour.</p>

    <p>I understand quite well what it is which preoccupies you in
    your new canvases, like <art id=0612>the village in the moonlight</art>, but I think
    that the search for some style is
    prejudicial to the true sentiment of things. In the last
    consignment of Gauguin's there is the same preoccupation as in
    your things, but with him there are many more reminiscences of
    the Japanese, the Egyptians, etc. As far as I am concerned I
    prefer a Breton woman of the countryside to a Breton woman with
    the gestures of a Japanese woman, but art knows no bounds, and
    so one is allowed to do what one thinks one ought to do.
    Guillaumin was in Auvergne last summer and has brought back
    some good canvases from there. As for him, he does not strive
    much for new effects in his colouration. He contents himself
    with what he has found, and one always finds the same pink,
    orange and blue-violet spots, but his stroke is vigorous, and
    his view of nature is certainly broad.</p>

    <p>Pissarro has gone away, and I suppose he is now occupying
    himself with that worthy man at Auvers. I hope he will succeed,
    and that we are going to see you next spring, if not earlier.
    Jo is quite well; she is getting considerably bigger, and feels
    life already, but this does not give her a too-unpleasant
    sensation.</p>

    <p>Mother sent us a letter from Cor; he has arrived at
    Johannesburg. It is a rather wild country, and one has to go
    about with a revolver all day long. There is no vegetation
    there, nothing but sand, except in the places which are oases.
    My letter has to go off now. Jo gives you her kindest regards.
    A cordial handshake.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
