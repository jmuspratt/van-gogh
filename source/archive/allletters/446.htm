  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have now been painting at the academy for a few days, and
    I must say that I like it pretty well. Especially because there
    are all kinds of painters there, and I see them work in the
    most varied ways, something I have never experienced before - I
    mean seeing others work.</p>

    <p>It would be by far the best thing for me to stay here a long
    time, for their models are good, and it will save a great deal
    of expenses of painting and models, and it is much more
    difficult than you seem to know, especially if one works alone.
    But let's hope that in this way things will improve.</p>

    <p>Next Monday we shall get new models; in fact, then I shall
    begin in earnest, and for Monday I ought to have had a large
    canvas; they also told me that I must definitely have other
    brushes, etc.</p>

    <p>But I haven't any money left, so it is really pressing, and
    I wish you would do what you can, for I am also doing what I
    can, and almost all the time it is such that hardly anything is
    left for food.</p>

    <p>In the evening I also go there to draw, but I think the
    fellows in the drawing class all work badly and in an
    absolutely wrong way.</p>

    <p>The painting class is better and, as I think I wrote you
    already, there are all kinds of people and of all ages, about
    five of them even older than I am.</p>

    <p>I am working for the moment on a child's head.</p>

    <p>It would be a relief to me if I could have your letter
    before Monday. What I wrote you about the clothes I want is
    also rather urgent. I have already made a few acquaintances who
    have seen the things I had brought for the admission.</p>

    <p>Among the studies of former pupils that are hanging there
    are some damned good ones.</p>

    <p>There are some by Neuhuys and Huibers among others.</p>

    <p>But the best one perhaps is by an American, I do not know
    the name. A nude study of an old man, one would say like a
    Fortuny or a Regnault.</p>

    <p>I do not think I can take a shorter cut to make progress,
    and whether I go to the country afterward or to a studio in
    Paris, at all events it is a good thing to see many others
    paint, and specially to work regularly from the model as much
    as ever is possible.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, I write you in a hurry because I must get to work.
    But try your best not to keep me waiting, for the work depends
    on it, and I assure you in any case it will be hard enough for
    me.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
