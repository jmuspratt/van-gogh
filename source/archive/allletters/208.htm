  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your letter of June 12 with enclosed 50 fr., and
    thank you most kindly. I did not answer you before because <label content="health.general">I
    did not know what turn my illness would take, as I did not
    recover as quickly as the doctor had expected. I have already
    been here more than two weeks, and I have had to pay for the
    next two weeks in advance, though perhaps, if everything goes
    well, I can leave in eight or ten days; but in that case I
    shall get part of my money back. Now this morning I spoke to
    the doctor and asked him if there has been some complication
    that would make things worse. He said, No - but rest and a
    prolonged stay in the hospital were necessary. But I can assure
    you that I am longing dreadfully for the sight of something
    green and for some fresh air; an experience like this makes one
    feel very weak and faint. I have to lie still almost all the
    time. I cannot draw, though I tried several times - it makes me
    too feverish. I can read, but I haven't any more books. Well,
    there will come an end to this sooner or later, so I must have
    patience.</label></p>

    <p>Sien is at Leyden, but I cannot hear from her until she is
    confined. What are the sufferings of us men compared to that
    terrible pain which women have to bear during childbirth. They
    are better than we are at patient suffering, but on the other
    hand we are superior in some other things.<label content="food-and-drink.preference"> She came to visit me
    regularly until the last day, and brought me some smoked beef
    and sugar or bread, which I have to do without now, and it
    makes me feel very faint. But now I am so sorry that I in turn
    cannot go to Leyden to bring her some extras that she might
    need, for the food one gets there is not particularly good.</label> It
    gives me such a strange feeling not to be able to do anything,
    and see the days pass by so idly. Sometimes I think I shall be
    able to do this or that, but then weakness gets the better of
    me.</p>

    <p>I am very glad you were interested in the drawings I sent
    you. I worked so hard on them, and on the ones for C. M. also,
    those last days when I suffered much more pain and was much
    more depressed than since I have been here. For I felt worse
    before I went to the hospital, long before.</p>

    <p>Now I want to tell you that I've had a letter from Rappard.
    Of course I had sent him back the 2.50 guilders at once, and
    then he answered me and repeated what he had already said about
    my drawings in the studio, namely that he liked them and felt
    sympathy for them because of their style and sentiment and
    character. He suggested that if I had some more like them, I
    should send them to him, as he thought he might be able to find
    a buyer. You can imagine that this is what I like best; it does
    me so much good when people find some sympathy for my work. For
    it is so discouraging and dispiriting, and acts like a damper,
    when one never hears, This or that is right, and full of
    sentiment and character. It is so cheering to realize that
    others feel something of what one has tried to express. Van
    Rappard also liked a few of the nude studies.</p>

    <p>For the first time in several days I am sitting up again,
    and I feel something revive in me while I write. If I were only
    well again! If I could only work here, how I should love to
    make some studies of the wards. I am now lying in another ward,
    without curtains around the beds or cots, and there are
    peculiar light effects, especially in the evening or in the
    night. The doctor is exactly as I should wish: he looks like
    some heads by Rembrandt, a splendid forehead and a very
    sympathetic expression. I hope to have learned this much from
    him, that in the future I shall try to handle my models the way
    he does his patients, namely by getting a firm hold on them and
    putting them straightway into the required position. It is
    astonishing how much patience he has, massaging the patients
    himself, rubbing them with ointment, and handling them in
    different ways, infinitely better than a male nurse does, and
    how well he knows how to banish their scruples and to make them
    do exactly as he wishes. There is one old man who would have
    been a superb St. Jerome - a thin, long sinewy, brown wrinkled
    body with such very distinct and expressive joints that it
    makes one melancholy not to be able to have him for a
    model.</p>

    <p>I can imagine that Heyerdahl is pleased with such a
    reward.</p>

    <p>I still have to tell you that Father came to visit me during
    my first days here, though it was only a short and very hurried
    visit, and I was not able to speak about anything that
    mattered. I would have preferred his visiting me another time,
    when on both sides we could have enjoyed it more. This way it
    was very strange to me, and seemed more or less like a dream,
    as does this whole business of lying here ill.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">Except for Sien, her mother, and for Father, I have not seen
    anybody, which is indeed for the best, though the days are
    rather lonesome and melancholy. Involountarily I often think
    how much more gloomy and lonesome things are now than, for
    instance, when I went to Mauve for the first time this winter.
    It stabs me to the heart and depresses me whenever I think of
    it, though I try to throw the whole thought overboard like
    useless ballast.</label></p>

    <p>I heard from one of the attendants that Breitner left the
    hospital recently.</p>

    <p>I believe that the doctor in this ward is a little more
    abrupt than in the more expensive wards; so much the better.
    Perhaps they are less afraid to hurt the patients a little here
    than in the more expensive wards, and, for instance, they often
    put a catheter into the bladder quickly, without
    &ldquo;ceremony&rdquo; or fuss. Well, so much the better, I
    think, and I repeat, I find it just as interesting here as in a
    third-class waiting room. If only I could work! But I must
    submit. I have a book by Dickens and my books on perspective
    with me.</p>

    <p>I hope you will write again, you know the address is City
    Hospital, Brouwersgracht - 4 Class - 6 Ward - No 9.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake in thought and once again many
    thanks for your faithful letter and what was enclosed. Have a
    good time and believe me, sincerely</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I think that I was too nervous when Sien had to leave, and
    that it caused a relapse; but there are moments when one cannot
    always keep calm. She is so alone there, and I should like so
    much to go and see her, for the days must be frightful for
    her.</p>
