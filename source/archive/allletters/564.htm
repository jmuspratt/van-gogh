    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Gauguin and I went yesterday to Montpellier to see the
    museum there and especially the Brias room. [Alfred Bruyas (or
    Brias) had left his personal collection to the Museum.] There
    are a lot of portraits of Brias, by Delacroix, Ricard, Courbet,
    Cabanel, Couture, Verdier, Tassaert, and others. Then there are
    pictures by Delacroix, Courbet, Giotto, Paul Potter,
    Botticelli, Th. Rousseau, very fine. Brias was a benefactor of
    artists, I shall say no more to you than that. In the portrait
    by Delacroix he is a gentleman with red beard and hair,
    confoundedly like you or me, and made me think of that poem by
    de Musset - &ldquo;<i>Partout ou j'ai touch&eacute; la terre -
    un malheureux v&eacute;tu de noir, aupr&egrave;s de nous venait
    s'asseoir, qui regardait comme un fr&egrave;re</i>.&rdquo;
    [Wherever I touched the earth, a wretch clad in black came and
    sat by us, looking at us like a brother.] It would have the
    same effect on you. I am sure. Please do go to that bookshop
    where they sell the lithographs by past and present artists,
    and see if you could get, not too dear, the lithograph after
    Delacroix's &ldquo;Tasso in the Madhouse,&rdquo; since I think
    the figure there must have some affinity with this fine
    portrait of Brias.</p>

    <p>They have got some more Delacroixs, the study of a
    &ldquo;Mulatto Woman&rdquo; (which Gauguin copied once), the
    &ldquo;Odalisques,&rdquo; &ldquo;Daniel in the Lions'
    Den&rdquo;; and by Courbet: first, the &ldquo;Village
    Girls,&rdquo; magnificent, a woman seen from behind, another
    lying on the ground in a landscape, second, the &ldquo;Woman
    Spinning,&rdquo; superb, and a whole heap more of Courbet's.
    But after all, you must know this collection exists, or else
    know people who have seen it, and consequently be able to talk
    about it. So I shan't say more about the museum (except the
    Barye drawings and bronzes).</p>

    <p>Gauguin and I talked a lot about Delacroix, Rembrandt, etc.
    Our arguments are <i>terribly electric</i>, we come out of them
    sometimes with our heads as exhausted as an electric battery
    after it has run down. We were in the midst of magic, for as
    Fromentin well says: Rembrandt is above all else a
    magician.</p>

    <p>I tell you this in connection with our Dutch friends de Haan
    and Isa&auml;cson, who have so sought after and loved Rembrandt
    so as to encourage you all to pursue your researches.</p>

    <p>You must not be discouraged in them.</p>

    <p>You know the strange and magnificent &ldquo;Portrait of a
    Man,&rdquo; by Rembrandt, in the Lacaze Gallery. I said to
    Gauguin that I myself saw in it a certain likeness in family or
    in race to Delacroix or to Gauguin himself, I do not know why,
    but I always call this portrait &ldquo;The Traveller,&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;The Man Come from Far.&rdquo; It is a similar and
    parallel idea to the one I've already spoken to you about, that
    I always look on the portrait of old Six, the fine portrait of
    the &ldquo;Man with a Glove,&rdquo; as you in the future, and
    the etching by Rembrandt, &ldquo;Six reading near a window in a
    shaft of sunlight,&rdquo; as you in the past and present. This
    is how things stand. Gauguin was saying to me this morning when
    I asked him how he felt &ldquo;that he felt his old self coming
    back,&rdquo; which gave me enormous pleasure.<label content="health.general"> When I came here
    myself last winter, tired out and almost stunned in mind,
    before ever being able to begin to recover I had a strain of
    inward suffering too.</label></p>

    <p>I do wish that some day you could see this Montpellier
    Museum - there are some very fine things.</p>

    <p>Say to Degas that Gauguin and I have been to see the
    portrait of Brias by Delacroix at Montpellier, for we must make
    bold to believe that <i>what it is</i>, and the portrait of
    Brias by Delacroix is as like you and me as a new brother.</p>

    <p>As for founding a way of life for artists chumming it
    together, you see such queer things, and I will wind up with
    what you are always saying - time will show. You can say all
    that to our friends Isa&auml;cson and de Haan, and even boldly
    read them this letter. I should have written to them already if
    I had felt the necessary electric force.</p>

    <p>A good hearty handshake all round from Gauguin as from
    me.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>If you should be thinking that Gauguin and I have facility
    in our work, I assure you that work does not always come easy,
    and that our Dutch friends may get no more discouraged than we
    do in their difficulties is my wish both for them and for
    you.</p>
