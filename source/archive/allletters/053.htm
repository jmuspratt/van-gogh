    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Will you do me a great favour? You know that edition of
    Andersen's Stories of the Moon, translated by Dr. ten Kate,
    which costs fifteen cents. Could you send me a copy when you
    have an opportunity?</p>

    <p>The box for The Hague in which I shall enclose the parcels I
    mentioned will not leave till tomorrow. The one for Father will
    not reach Etten in time, but send it as soon as you can.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">Till now I have had no replies to the letters I have written
    in response to advertisements, nor have I heard from Uncle
    Vincent. I wrote to Mr. Obach, asking if he would give
    references if required, and he answered me with a very kind
    note. Well, boy, what can I do but continue on my way quietly,
    looking to Him whom we think of when we say, &ldquo;Who will
    show us the right path?&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>&Agrave; Dieu, kind regards to our friends, always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
