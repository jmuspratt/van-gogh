  <body>
    <p>Wednesday morning</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Along with this letter you will receive the first proofs of
    a lithograph,<art id=1656> &ldquo;A Digger,&rdquo;</art> and of a
    lithograph of<art id=1657> a &ldquo;Man Drinking Coffee.&rdquo;</art>
    I should like to hear as soon as possible what you think
    of them. I still intend to retouch them on the stone, but I
    want your opinion about them first.</p>

    <p><art id=996a>The drawings</art> were better. I had worked hard on them,
    especially on the digger; now several things have been lost in
    transferring them to the stone and in the printing. But I think
    there is something rough and audacious in these prints that I
    wanted there, and this partially reconciles me to losing things
    which were in the drawing.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">The <art id=1682>drawing</art> was
    not done with lithographic crayon only, but
    was touched up with autographic ink. Now the stone has only
    partly caught that autographic ink, and we do not know what to
    ascribe it to, probably my diluting it with water.</p>

    <p>At all events, it shows that the ink gave strong black tones
    where it caught; I hope to get better results with it later.
    Then when the printer has more time, we shall make experiments
    by bringing a kind of wash over it during the printing, and we
    will try different kinds of paper and different kinds of
    printing ink.</label></p>

    <p>I hope these two stones will improve even more by retouching
    in accordance with the two studies made directly from the
    model, which I still have.</p>

    <p>At last a painter has come to see me, namely Van der Weele,
    who stopped me on the street, and I have also been to see him.
    I hope he will also try this process of lithography. I wish he
    would try it with two ploughs which he has - painted studies (a
    morning and evening effect) and an oxcart on the heath.</p>

    <p>That fellow has many fine things in his studio.</p>

    <p>He wanted me to make a composition of my many studies of old
    men, but I feel I am not ready yet.</p>

    <p>You know, I wrote you about the series of diggers; now you
    can see a print of them, too.</p>

    <p>No news about the letter. Here at the post office they know
    nothing about it, and put all the blame on Paris.</p>

    <p>When your last letter came, after having had to wait so
    long, I had to pay so much at once that little was left.
    However, I have made those two experiments in lithography
    again, notwithstanding the expense, because especially in hard
    times I see in work the only safety, and I will fight to get
    ahead.</p>

    <p>But today or tomorrow all my money will be gone. If it is
    possible for you to send something, do so, if not, it is
    neither your fault nor mine - but the days will be hard. Well,
    quand m&ecirc;me, we must keep heart as long as we can, and not
    give away to melancholy or weakness.</p>

    <p>There is a popular paper here called The Swallow, published
    by Elsevier in Rotterdam, backed by the Society for General
    Welfare. I have been wondering whether they could use such a
    digger, for instance. An edition is published monthly. But it
    would cost me a trip to Rotterdam, and I am so afraid I should
    have to go home with the answer: Business is too slack, we
    cannot take anything, etc. Besides, I should prefer not doing
    so - I would much rather work longer, until I have put a good
    series together. But as I am so frequently hard up for money, I
    often think of trying to earn something. Que faire?</p>

    <p>Even if you don't have the money, boy, do write, for I need
    your sympathy, which is not worth less to me than the money. I
    hope you received the roll with lithographs containing
    &ldquo;Sorrow&rdquo; and the letter which accompanied it. I
    mention it again to make sure, not because I had already
    expected an answer.</p>

    <p>The weather has been very cold here; today it is quite dark,
    grey and gloomy, but it gives a rough aspect of non
    &eacute;barb&eacute; to everything.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with best wishes and a handshake in thought, believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Always yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>In the drawing of the &ldquo;Man Drinking Coffee,&rdquo; the
    black has been much more broken by the direction of the
    hatching. Unfortunately, it has become dull now, but perhaps
    that can be fixed.</p>
