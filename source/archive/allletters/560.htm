  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It's rather more than time for me to write you a collected
    letter for once. First of all thank you for your kind letter,
    also for the 100-fr. note it contained. Our days pass in
    working, working all the time, in the evening we are dead beat
    and go off to the cafe, and after that, early to bed! Such is
    our life.</p>

    <p>Of course it is winter here with us too, though it's still
    very fine from time to time. But I do not dislike trying to
    work from imagination, since that allows me to stay in. It does
    not worry me to work in the heat of a stove, but cold does not
    suit me, as you know. Only I have spoiled <art id=0496>that thing that I did
    of the garden in Nuenen</art>, and I think that you also need
    practice for work from the imagination.</p>

    <p>But I have made portraits of <i>a whole family</i>, that of
    the postman <art id=0433>whose head I had done previously</art> - <art id=0434>the man</art>,
    <art id=0503>his wife</art>, <art id=0441a>the baby</art>, <art id=0537>the</art> <art id=0538>young boy</art>,
    and <art id=0492>the son</art> <art id=0493>of sixteen</art>, all of
    them real characters and very French, though they look like
    Russians. Size 15 canvases. You know how I feel about this, how
    I feel in my element, and that it consoles me up to a certain
    point for not being a doctor. I hope to get on with this and to
    be able to get more careful posing, paid for by portraits. And
    if I manage to do <i>this whole family</i> better still, at
    least I shall have done something to my liking and something
    individual. Just now I am completely swamped with studies,
    studies, studies, and this will go on for quite a while - it
    makes such a mess that it breaks my heart, and yet it will
    provide me with some property when I'm forty.</p>

    <p>From time to time there's a canvas which will make a
    picture, such as the <art id=0450>&ldquo;Sower&rdquo;</art> in question, which I
    myself think better than the first.</p>

    <p>If we can stand the siege, victory will come to us one day,
    in spite of our not being among the people who are talked
    about. It is rather a case that makes you think of the proverb
    - joy in public, sorrow at home.</p>

    <p>What can you expect? Supposing that the fight is still
    before us, we must just try to mature quietly.</p>

    <p>You always told me to work more for quality than
    quantity.</p>

    <p>Now nothing prevents us from having a good many studies
    labelled as such, and consequently a whole lot of things not
    for sale. And if we are <i>obliged</i> to sell sooner or later,
    then let's sell, at a somewhat higher price, things which can
    hold their own from the point of view of serious effort.</p>

    <p>I think that, in spite of myself, I shall not be able to
    refrain from sending you some canvases soon, say <i>within a
    month</i>. I say in spite of myself, for I am convinced that
    canvases gain by drying thoroughly here in the South until the
    impasto is dry all the way through, and that takes a long time,
    say a year. It would certainly be better if I can refrain from
    sending them. For there is no need to show them at the moment,
    I know that well enough.</p>

    <p>Gauguin works a lot. I very much like a still life,
    background and foreground yellow; he is working on a portrait
    of me which I do not count among his useless undertakings; just
    now he is doing some landscapes; and lastly, he has a good
    canvas of women washing, even very good I think.</p>

    <p>You were to get two drawings from Gauguin in return for the
    50 francs you sent him in Brittany. But Mother Bernard has
    simply appropriated them. Speaking of stories without a name,
    this really is one. I think that she will give them up in the
    end. Mind you, in my opinion, Bernard's things are very fine,
    and he will have deserved success in Paris.</p>

    <p>Very interesting, your meeting Chatrian.</p>

    <p>Is he fair or dark? I want to know that, since I know the
    two portraits.</p>

    <p>Of their work, I like Mme. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se and L'Ami
    Fritz especially. I think there is more to find fault with in
    the Histoire d'un sous-ma&icirc;tre than I thought possible
    before.</p>

    <p>I think that we shall end up spending our evenings drawing
    and writing, there is more work than we can manage.</p>

    <p>You know that Gauguin is invited to exhibit at the
    &ldquo;Vingtistes.&rdquo; He is already imagining settling in
    Brussels, and that certainly would be a means towards his being
    able to see his Danish wife again.</p>

    <p>Since in the meantime he is very successful with the
    Arl&eacute;siennes, I should not consider this entirely
    insignificant. He is married but he doesn't look it very much.
    In short, I fear that there is an absolute incompatibility of
    character between his wife and him, but he naturally cares more
    for his children, who are very pretty according to the
    portraits.</p>

    <p><i>We</i> aren't so gifted in that respect. Good-by for now.
    A handshake for you and the Dutchmen.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Gauguin will write you tomorrow, he is waiting for a reply
    to his letter and sends you his good wishes.</p>
