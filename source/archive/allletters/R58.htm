  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I sent a basket containing birds' nests to your address
    today. I have some in my own studio too. They are nests of the
    thrush, the blackbird, the golden oriole, the wren and the
    finch. I hope they will arrive safe and sound.</p>

    <p>Do you know much about Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix? I read a
    splendid article about him by Silvestre. To write down a few
    words for you that occur to me right now, the article ended
    thus: &ldquo;Ainsi mourut presqu'en souriant Eug&egrave;ne
    Delacroix -peintre de grande race qui avait un soleil dans la
    t&ecirc;te et un orage dans le coeur - qui - des guerriers
    passa aux saints - des saints aux amants - des amants aux
    tigres - et des tigres aux fleurs.&rdquo; [Thus died, almost
    smiling, Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix - painter of noble race - who
    had a sun in his head and a thunderstorm in his heart - who -
    passed from warriors to saints - from saints to lovers - from
    lovers to tigers - and from tigers to flowers.]</p>

    <p>These words struck me, as the whole article demonstrated
    that the atmosphere of the colours and the tone in his pictures
    was identical with their meaning - the contrast of the colours,
    the broken effect, the reciprocal reacting of black to white,
    of yellow to violet, of orange to blue, of red to green.</p>

    <p>And further, Delacroix writes to a friend, &ldquo;La
    chapelle o&ugrave; j'ai paint ma Piet&agrave; &eacute;tait
    tellement obscure que je n'ai pas su d'abord comment peindre
    pour faire parler mon tableau, - j'ai &eacute;t&eacute;
    oblig&eacute; de peindre dans le cadavre du Christ les ombres
    avec du bleu de Prusse, les lumi&egrave;res avec du jaune de
    chr&ocirc;me pur.&rdquo; [The chapel where I painted my
    Piet&agrave; was so dark that I did not know at first how to
    paint so as to make my picture speak - I was forced to paint
    the shadows of the corpse of Christ with Prussian blue, the
    light parts with pure chrome-yellow.] To this the author adds,
    &ldquo;Il faut &ecirc;tre Delacroix pour oser cela.&rdquo; [One
    would have to be a Delacroix to dare do this.]</p>

    <p>Then I read somewhere else, &ldquo;Lorsque Delacroix peint -
    c'est comme le lion qui d&eacute;vore le morceau.&rdquo; [When
    Delacroix paints - it's like a lion devouring a piece (of
    meat).]</p>

    <p>And this last is the very thing Silvestre's article is full
    of.</p>

    <p>What amazing fellows those French painters are - a Millet,
    Delacroix, Corot, Troyon, Daubigny, Rousseau, and a Daumier or
    a Jacque - not forgetting Jules Dupr&eacute; especially! A new
    one of the same breed is Lhermitte.</p>

    <p>Another thing about Delacroix. He had a discussion with a
    friend about the question of working absolutely after nature,
    and he said on this occasion that one must get one's
    <i>studies</i> from nature but that the <i>ultimate picture</i>
    ought to be made <i>from memory</i>. That friend was
    walking with him on the boulevard when they were having this
    discussion - which had already become pretty vehement. When
    they parted company, the other one still wasn't entirely
    convinced. Delacroix let him toddle on for a bit after he took
    his leave, and then (using his two hands as a speaking trumpet)
    he roared after him in a lusty voice, to the consternation of
    the respectable citizens passing by, &ldquo;Par coeur! Par
    coeur!&rdquo; [From memory!].</p>

    <p>I can't tell you how much I enjoyed reading this article, as
    well as another one about Delacroix by Gigoux. I have read
    besides a fine book by Bracquemond, the etcher, <i>Du Dessin et de
    la Couleur.</i></p>

    <p>Another thing about Delacroix, writes Silvestre, &ldquo;On
    dit que Delacroix ne dessine pas - dites que Delacroix ne
    dessine pas <i>comme les autres.</i>&rdquo; [they say that
    Delacroix does not draw - they ought to say that Delacroix does
    not draw <i>like others.</i>]</p>

    <p>How truly, my friend, one might say <i>the same</i> in
    denial of the assertion that Mauve, Isra&euml;ls, Maris <i>do
    not</i> draw.</p>

    <p>Another thing - the painter Gigoux comes to Delacroix with
    an antique bronze and asks his opinion about its genuineness.
    &ldquo;Ce n'est pas de l'antique, c'est de la
    renaissance&rdquo; [it is not from antiquity, it is from the
    renaissance] says D. Gigoux asks him what reason he has for
    saying this - &ldquo;Tenez, mon ami, c'est tr&egrave;s beau,
    mais c'est pris par la ligne et les anciens prenaient par les
    milieux (par les masses, par <i>noyaux</i>).&rdquo; [Look here,
    my friend, it is very beautiful, but it is starved from lines,
    and the ancients started from the central things (the masses,
    the <i>nuclei.</i>] And he adds, &ldquo;Look here a
    moment,&rdquo; and draws a number of ovals on a piece of paper
    - and he <i>puts these ovals together</i> by means of little
    lines, hardly anything at all, and out of this creates a
    rearing horse full of life and movement.
    &ldquo;G&eacute;ricault and Gros,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;have
    learned this from the Greek - to express the <i>masses</i>
    (nearly always egg-shaped) first tracing the contours and the
    action from the position and the proportions of these oval
    shapes.&rdquo; And I say that this was first pointed out to
    Delacroix by G&eacute;ricault.</p>

    <p>Now I ask you, isn't this a <i>superb truth</i>?</p>

    <p>But&hellip;does one learn it from the plaster-of-Paris
    artists or at the drawing academy? I think <i>not</i>!
    <i>If</i> it were taught <i>in this way</i>, I should be
    pleased to be an enthusiastic admirer of the academy, but I
    know only too well that such is not the case.</p>

    <p>I sent Wenkebach an article about the Salon by Paul Mantz
    with a request to let you read it too. Have you got it? I
    thought it excellent.</p>

    <p>I thought that you might like the birds' nests as much as I
    do myself, for really and truly birds - such as the wren and
    the golden oriole - rank among the artists too. At the same
    time they are beautiful stuff for still lifes.</p>

    <p>Good-by, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
