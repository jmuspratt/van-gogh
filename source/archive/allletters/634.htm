    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>After a last discussion with M. Peyron, I have permission to
    pack, and have sent my luggage by goods train. The 30 kilos of
    luggage which one may carry will be enough for me to bring some
    frames, the easel and stretchers, etc., with me. I shall leave
    as soon as you write M. Peyron. I feel quite calm and I do not
    think that in my present condition I shall be easily upset.</p>

    <p>In any case I hope to be in Paris before Sunday so as to
    spend your free day quietly with you all. I very much hope to
    see Andr&eacute; Bonger too at the first opportunity.</p>

    <p>I have just finished <art id=0682>another canvas of pink roses against a
    yellow-green back-ground in a green vase</art>.</p>

    <p>I hope that the canvases I am doing now will make up for the
    expense of the journey.</p>

    <p>This morning when I had been to pay for my luggage, I saw
    the country again after the rain, quite fresh and full of
    flowers - what things I could still have done.</p>

    <p>I have also written to Arles, asking them to send off the
    two beds with the bedding by goods train. I figure that this
    can only cost about 10 francs or so for carriage, and it is
    always so much saved from the wreck. For it will certainly be
    useful to me in the country. If you have not yet answered M.
    Peyron's letter, please send him a wire, so that I can make the
    journey on Friday or Saturday at the latest, so as to spend
    Sunday with you. By doing so I shall also waste less time for
    my work, which for the moment is finished here.</p>

    <p>In Paris - if I feel strong enough - I should very much like
    to do at once a picture of a yellow bookshop (gas effect),
    which I have had in mind so long. You will see that I'll be fit
    for it the day after my arrival. I tell you, I feel my head is
    absolutely calm for my work, and the brush strokes come to me
    and follow each other logically. Anyway, till Sunday at the
    latest, I shake your hand, and meanwhile kindest regards to
    Jo.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Probably the reply to M. Peyron will already have been sent
    - I hope so. I was a little worried because it was delayed a
    few days, as this seems utterly pointless to me. For either I
    shall plunge into fresh work here, or it is just now that I
    have leisure for the journey.</p>

    <p>Spending days here or elsewhere doing nothing would make me
    miserable in my present state of mind.</p>

    <p>Besides, M. Peyron does not object, but naturally when one
    leaves, the position with regard to the rest of the management
    is rather difficult. But that will be all right, and we'll
    separate amicably.</p>
