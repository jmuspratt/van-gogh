    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and for placing the advertisement.
    Did you find the postal order in the letter?</p>

    <p>Yesterday afternoon, the wind was so strong that Mr. Stokes
    wouldn't let the boys go out. I asked his permission, for six
    of the biggest and myself, to go for a short walk. We went down
    to the beach, the sea was very rough, and it was not very easy
    to walk against the wind. We saw the lifeboat towed by a tug,
    returning from a mission to a ship that had run aground on a
    sandbank; but it didn't bring it off.</p>

    <p>I know that picture by Willems very well; the drawing by
    Mauve which you write about must be very beautiful. Do you ever
    go to his studio?</p>

    <p>You ask me what I teach the boys. Mainly French basics; only
    one student is starting the study of German. For the rest, a
    little of everything, mainly sums, examinations, their
    dictation, etc. So for the present, there is nothing too
    complicated in all this, but it is not easy to see that what
    they are learning is what we are teaching them.</p>

    <p>And now today is your birthday; in thought I give you a firm
    handshake and send you my very best wishes once more.</p>

    <p>Obviously, I have hours of supervision after school, so my
    time is pretty well taken up, perhaps it will get more in the
    future. Last Saturday evening, I gave a bath to a half dozen of
    these young gentlemen, not because I was obliged to, but
    because that allowed us to be ready on time. I also try to make
    them read. I have some books that are well suited for boys, The
    Wide, Wide World <sup>1</sup>, etc.</p>

    <p>And now goodbye. Thanks for your letter, for placing the
    advertisement and for sending the paper. Always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>One of these days you will receive some English hymnbooks; I
    shall mark a few poems in them. There are so many beautiful
    ones, and especially when heard often, one grows so fond of
    them.</p>
