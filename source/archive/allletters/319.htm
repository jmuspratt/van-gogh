  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your letter just now, coming home from the dunes
    behind Loosduinen, wet through, for I had been sitting in the
    rain for about three hours on a spot where everything was
    reminiscent of Ruysdael, Daubigny or Jules Dupr&eacute;. I came
    back with a <art id=010>study of twisted, gnarled little trees</art>,
    and another one of <art id=016>a farm after the rain</art>.
    Everything is already bronze coloured. Everything is
    what one can see in nature only during this time of the year,
    or when one looks at some pictures by Dupr&eacute;, for
    instance; and it is so beautiful that one's imagination always
    falls short of it.</p>

    <p>You write about your walk that Sunday in Ville d'Avray; at
    the same moment on the same day, I too was walking alone, and I
    too want to tell you something about that walk, when our
    thoughts probably met again. As I wrote you, I had spoken to
    the woman - we felt that in the future it would be impossible
    for us to stay together, nay, that we should make each other
    unhappy, yet we both felt how strongly we are attached to each
    other and then I went far out into the country to have a talk
    with nature. Well, I walked to Voorburg and from there to
    Leidendam. You know the scenery there, splendid trees, majestic
    and serene, right next to horrible green toy summerhouses and
    all the absurdities the heavy fancy of retired Dutchmen can
    invent in the form of flower plots, arbors and porches. Most of
    the houses very ugly; some, however, old and stately. Now at
    that very moment, high over the meadows, boundless as the
    desert, one mass of clouds after the other came sailing on, and
    the wind first struck the row of country houses with their
    clumps of trees on the other side of the canal, bordered by the
    black cinder path. Those trees were superb; there was drama in
    each figure I was going to say, but I mean in each tree. But
    the scene as a whole was even more beautiful than those
    scourged trees viewed apart, because at that moment even those
    absurd little summerhouses assumed a curious character,
    dripping with rain and disheveled.</p>

    <p>It seemed to me an image of how even a man of absurd
    deportment and conventions, or another one full of
    eccentricities and caprice, may become a dramatic figure of a
    peculiar type, if only real sorrow strikes him - a calamity
    befalls him. And the thought crossed my mind, how at moments
    when today's deteriorating society is society seen against the
    light of a renewal, it stands out as a large, gloomy
    silhouette.</p>

    <p>Yes, for me, the drama of storm in nature, the drama of
    sorrow in life, is the most impressive.</p>

    <p>A &ldquo;Paradou&rdquo; is beautiful, but Gethsemane is even
    more beautiful.</p>

    <p>Oh, there must be a little bit of light, a little bit of
    happiness, just enough to indicate the shape, to make the lines
    of the silhouette stand out, but let the whole be gloomy.</p>

    <p>I must say that the woman is bearing up well. She is unhappy
    about it, as I am, but she is not disheartened and keeps busy.
    I had just bought a piece of material to make canvases for my
    studies, and have now given it to her to make underwear for the
    kids, and some of my things can be altered for them too, so
    that she will not leave me empty-handed. So she is very busy
    sewing these things.</p>

    <p>When I say we part as friends, it is true - but the parting
    is final, and after all I am more resigned than I thought I'd
    be, because her faults were such that it would have been a
    fatal thing to be bound together, for me as well as for
    herself, because one is, so to speak, responsible for one
    another's faults.</p>

    <p>But I ask myself anxiously - how will she be in a year?</p>

    <p>I shall certainly <i>never</i> take her into my house again,
    but I do not want to lose sight of her, for I am too fond of
    her and the children.</p>

    <p>And for the very reason that it was and is a feeling other
    than passion, this is possible too.</p>

    <p>I hope the Drenthe project will be carried out.</p>

    <p>You ask me what I should need.</p>

    <p>I need not tell you that I intend to work hard. I must do
    that in order to renew myself. And no painting materials
    whatever are available down there, so as to stocking up on
    them, the more one has of the really useful things, the better.
    Good materials are never thrown away, and though they are
    expensive, one makes up for it later, and a lot of painting
    must he done in order to make progress. I hope to waste very
    little of the time I shall spend there, and hope to have models
    often, which probably will be much cheaper there.</p>

    <p>And life is cheaper and I shall be able to do more with the
    150 francs there than here.</p>

    <p>But I can arrange all this according to the circumstances. I
    wish I could have a large amount to spend, because I need so
    many things that others have, and which one can hardly do
    without.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">My intention is to make so much progress in painting in
    Drenthe that when I come back I might be admitted as a member
    of the Society of Draughtsmen. This is again in reference to a
    second plan to go to England.</label></p>

    <p>I don't think it wrong to speculate, if only one doesn't do
    it in thin air, or on too unsolid a basis. This in regard to
    England.</p>

    <p>I certainly expect it will be easier for me to sell there
    than here, that's true, so I sometimes think of England; but I
    do not know to what extent my work will please the English art
    lovers, and as I do not know this, I will first make a small
    positive start in selling before I shall think it advisable to
    try it there. Once I have sold a few things here, then I shall
    hesitate no longer, but start sending things or go there
    myself.</p>

    <p>But as long as I sell absolutely nothing here, I could
    easily be mistaken in the right moment if I were not wise
    enough to wait till I see an opening here. I hope you will
    approve of this idea; that would comfort me, for in England
    they are very serious once they start something: whoever
    catches the public's fancy in England finds faithful friends
    there. Take, for instance, Ed. Fr&egrave;re and Henrietta
    Browne, who remain as interesting now is they were when their
    work was little known there.</p>

    <p>But to have success, one must give good work, and be sure of
    keeping up the standard of what one has set.</p>

    <p>I was glad to see from your letter that you approve of the
    Drenthe plan; that's enough for me, the advantages it will
    bring will be apparent later. For me, it is directly connected
    with my trying to become a member of the Society of
    Draughtsmen, and then going to England - because I know for
    sure that if I succeed in putting some sentiment into the
    subjects out there, they will find sympathy in England.</p>

    <p>Well, I must carry out the Drenthe plan, be it with more or
    less money. As soon as I can pay the fare, I shall go, even if
    I have only a small supply of painting materials.</p>

    <p>Because the moment of the autumn effects is already there,
    and I must catch some of them.</p>

    <p>But I hope I shall be able to leave something behind for the
    woman, to help her through the first weeks. But as soon as I
    <i>can</i> go, I <i>will</i>.</p>

    <p>I tell you that I intend to help the woman a little at
    first; I <i>may</i> not do much, nor can I, but I mention this
    only to you.</p>

    <p>And you may depend on it that whatever may happen to her, I
    neither can nor ever will live with her again, for she is
    incapable of doing what she ought to do.</p>

    <p>I also dropped Father a line to tell him that I had parted
    company with her, but that for all that, my letter to Father
    about my continuing to be true to her and being willing to
    marry her remained a fact. And another fact is that Father
    avoided the issue at the time, and did not reply to the
    fundamental question. And I do not know how it will appear to
    me in later years - for instance, whether this might not have
    been better than leaving her; now we are too close to the facts
    to get the right view of the basic interrelation and
    consequences of all the things.</p>

    <p>I do <i>hope</i> everything will come out right, but her
    future as well as my own looks gloomy. I am inclined to believe
    there is some latent good in her still, but the trouble is, it
    <i>ought to have been</i> roused already. Now, as she has
    nobody to rely on, it will be more difficult for her to follow
    her good impulses.</p>

    <p><i>Now</i> she never cared to listen; <i>then</i> she will
    long to speak with me, and I shall no longer be there. As long
    as she was with me, she had no other standard of comparison,
    and in other surroundings she will remember things which she
    does not care for and which she did not pay attention to.
    <i>Now</i> by contrast she will be reminded of them.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it is an anguishing thought, that we both feel it
    is impossible for us to struggle along together in the future,
    and yet are <i>so</i> much attached to each other. Of late she
    has been more trustful with me than usual, and she has refused
    to play some ugly tricks which her mother had instigated.
    Things of the kind you mentioned when you were here, of
    starting a row and the like.</p>

    <p>You see there is a seed of more seriousness in her, if that
    might only stay. I wish she could marry, and when I tell you I
    am keeping an eye on her, it is because I advised her to do
    <i>that</i>.</p>

    <p>If she could only find a man who was not altogether bad,
    that would do; the foundation that was laid here would then
    develop, namely that of a more domestic, simpler disposition;
    and if she sticks to that, in the future I need not leave her
    quite to her fate, for then I at least remain her friend, and a
    true one.</p>

    <p>Write soon again and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
