    <p>[Letter to his friend Eug&egrave;ne Boch]</p>

    <p>My dear friend Bock,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter which pleased me very much. I
    congratulate you on not having hesitated this time and on
    having attacked the Borinage. There you have a field where you
    will be able to work all your life [<i>illegible</i>] - the
    extraordinary scenery [as well] as the figure.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">The tip girls in their pit rags especially are superb. If
    you should ever go to Petit Wasmes, please inquire whether Jean
    Baptiste Denis, farmer, and Joseph Quinet, miner, are still
    living there, and tell them from me that I have never forgotten
    the Borinage and that I should still be delighted to see it
    again.</label></p>

    <p>Now I must tell you a piece of news, namely that I have
    furnished the house at last and that I have immediately
    furnished a bedroom for Gauguin or for anyone else who should
    come.</p>

    <p>The house is a lot brighter now that it is furnished. After
    that I have worked like blazes, for the fall is without wind
    and superb. I am also working on seven square size 30 canvases.
    In the first place <art id=0463>the night caf&eacute; where I have stayed
    with lamp light effect, painted in the nighttime</art>.</p>

    <p><art id=0470>Three views</art> of <art id=0468>the public garden</art> in front of the house.</p>

    <p>[Here appears <art id=670_V-E_553b0>a sketch of a lost painting, Poet's Garden II.</art>]</p>

    <p>This is one of the views. A round clipped cypress or cedar
    shrub of a bottle green on a yellow-green lawn. In the
    background a row of oleanders and two figures. A sky of raw
    cobalt. You see, it is even a lot simpler than formerly.[Painting lost]</p>

    <p><art id=0574>Then ploughed fields; a scenery with nothing but lumps of
    earth, the furrows the colour of an old wooden shoe under a
    forget-me-not blue sky with white cloud flocks</art>.</p>

    <p><art id=0474>Further a view of my house and its surroundings in a sulphur
    sun. The sky hard and bright cobalt. - A difficult job, I tell you!</art></p>

    <p><art id=0467>Then a view of the caf&eacute; on Forum Square where we used
    to go, painted by night</art>.</p>

    <p><art id=0474>And lastly a study of the Rh&ocirc;ne - of the town lighted
    with gas reflected in the blue river.</art></p>

    <p>Over it the starry sky with the Great Bear - a sparkling of
    pink and green on the cobalt blue field of the night sky,
    whereas the lights of the town and its ruthless reflections are
    red gold and bronzed green.</p>

    <p>The garden with the oleanders and the round clipped shrub
    has an impasto like painted porcelain.</p>

    <p><art id=0462>Your portrait</art> is in my bedroom along with <art id=0473>that of Milliet,
    the Zouave,</art> which I have just finished. I should like to ask
    you to exchange one of your studies of the coal-mines for
    something of mine, - but stop! - I myself am going to send you
    a study first, when I am sure it is one which will seem wholly
    unknown to you. For if you saw the night studies you might like
    them better than the sunlight studies. Well, leave it to me.
    For I hope that our intercourse once started will last
    forever.</p>

    <p>Everything you'll do will interest me extraordinarily,
    because I love that dismal country of the Borinage, which will
    always remain unforgettable to me, so much.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I have nearly made up my mind, when I go to Paris next year,
    to push on as far as Mons. And perhaps even as far as my native
    country to do some spots that I know already.</label> In the same way
    in the Borinage Marcusse, or from Antoine to Petit Wasmes. And
    further the Cour de l'Agrappe in Frameries where you are now.
    As a matter of fact it was in the Borinage that I first started
    to work from nature. But of course I destroyed it all a long
    time ago.</p>

    <p>But it stirs my heart that these spots are going to be
    painted at last.</p>

    <p>You will see how easily ideas will come to you.</p>

    <p>I am writing you in a great hurry, but I wanted to answer
    your letter at once.</p>

    <p>Enclosed a pretty bad sketch of the starry night. All these
    pictures are square size 30 canvases. If you had stayed here
    until now, you would have taken along other studies! For I tell
    you the scenery has been <i>extraordinarily</i> beautiful.</p>

    <p>More than once I have done a size 30 canvas in one day, but
    then I did not stir from the spot from morning till sunset
    except to eat a morsel. My brother wrote me he saw you in
    passing. Well, I hope we'll meet again next year. Above all
    don't forget to let me have your address when you move, or to
    give me your exact permanent address in La Louvi&egrave;re, if
    my memory serves me well, for it will be excellent to work
    continuously in the mining district, and also to see something
    quite different come to the country of the oleanders and the
    sulphur sun.</p>

    <p>Is your sister going to do the miners too? Surely there is
    work enough for two. I think it is a very pleasant thing for
    you to be both painting in the same house.</p>

    <p>[<art id=670_V-E_553b1>See the reproduction of part of the letter.<art>]
    </p>

    <p>Well, I must go out to work in the vineyard near Mont
    Majour. It is all purple and yellow-green under a blue sky, a
    beautiful colour motif.</p>

    <p>A hearty handshake and good courage and a lot of success
    with your work.</p>

    <p>Sincerely, Vincent.</p>

    <p>Excuse my great hurry; I haven't even time to read this
    letter over&hellip;</p>
