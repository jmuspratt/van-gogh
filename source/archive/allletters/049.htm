    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I was looking forward to the letter I received this morning,
    and am very glad that you are recovering. Your parcel was only
    sent today; the little book by Jules Breton is in it.</p>

    <p>I am longing for Christmas and am eager to see you, boy, but
    it will be soon enough now. I think I shall leave here a week
    from Sunday, in the evening. Try your best to get as long a
    holiday as possible.</p>

    <p>And now there is another thing, which I hope you will pardon
    my mentioning. You too, you have found the poems of Heine and
    d'Uhland are beautiful. Be on guard, old son, they are
    dangerous traps. The illusion is of short duration, do not
    abandon yourself to them.</p>

    <p>Don't you think it would be best to put away those little
    old books I copied for you?</p>

    <p>If, later, the books of Heine and d'Uhland fall into your
    hands again, you may reread them with other feelings and a more
    serene heart.</p>

    <p>I like very much Erckmann-Chatrian, as you know. Do you know
    L'Ami Fritz<i>?</i></p>

    <p>To get back to Heine:</p>

    <p>Take the portraits of Father and that of Mother, then take
    Brion's Les Adieux, read Heine with these three images in front
    of your eyes and you will understand what I am talking about.
    Old son, you know although I fear not in the least to preach or
    to lecture you, because I know only you are, in your soul, like
    me, this is why I talk seriously with you from time to time. In
    any case, experience what I have told you.</p>

    <p>I hope you will be well before long and will write soon. How
    is Willem Valkis? My regards to him and all the family and all
    who know me, also to Van Iterson.</p>

    <p>Just now we have a beautiful picture by Schreyer, a wagon
    with horses in an autumn landscape, with a setting sun. Also a
    beautiful Jacque, a melancholy landscape with sheep. How do you
    like that small Jacque, &ldquo;Ploughing,&rdquo; that has been
    in The Hague for some time? Very best wishes and speedy
    recovery. Always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
