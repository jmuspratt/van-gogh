    <p>[Letter to the Van Stockum - Haanebeek family]</p>

    <p>Dear friends,</p>

    <p>It was a pleasant surprise to me to receive Carolien's
    letter. Thanks. With all my heart I hope she is quite well
    again; a good thing it is over now!</p>

    <p>In your next letter I should like to hear more about that
    last play you wrote. I was really amazed: for ten characters -
    it must be the biggest you have done.</p>

    <p>These last days I have greatly enjoyed reading the poems of
    John Keats; he is a poet who, I think, is not very well known
    in Holland. He is the favourite of all the painters here, and
    so I started reading him. Here is something by him. His
    best-known piece is &ldquo;The Eve of St. Agnes,&rdquo; but it
    is a bit too long to copy.</p>

    <p>I have visited neither Crystal Palace nor the Tower yet, nor
    Tussod <sup>1</sup>; I am not in a hurry to see everything. For
    the present I am quite satisfied with the museums, parks, etc.;
    they interest me more.</p>

    <p>Last Monday I had a nice day. The first Monday in August is
    a holiday here. I went with one of the Germans to Dulwich, an
    hour and a half outside L., to see the museum there, and after
    that we took about an hour's walk to another village.</p>

    <p>The country is so beautiful here; many people who have their
    businesses in London live in some village outside L. and go to
    town by train every day; perhaps I shall do the same shortly,
    if I can find a cheap room somewhere. But moving is so horrible
    that I shall stop here as long as possible, although everything
    is not so beautiful as it seemed to me in the beginning.
    Perhaps it is my own fault, so I shall bear with it a little
    longer.</p>

    <p>Pardon me if this letter is not as I should like it to be,
    for I am writing in a hurry. I wanted to congratulate you on
    Willem's birthday and wish you many happy returns.</p>

    <p>I was most pleased to learn that you have renewed your
    acquaintance with the Tersteeg family. I have been hoping you
    would for a long time.</p>

    <p>When you have a chance, please let me know what photographs
    you have received - I am curious to know. I have had a letter
    from Marinus, from which I learned that he is going to
    Amsterdam. This will mean a great change for him; I hope he
    will do well. I was very glad he wrote me.</p>

    <p><label content="Feelings.nostalgia">A few days ago a brother of Iterson's paid me a call, and
    for the first time since May I had a chance to speak Dutch. We
    live far apart, much to my regret.</label></p>

    <p>Good luck to you. Remember me to all in the Poten. Good
    luck!</p>

    <p>Yours truly, Vincent</p>

    <p>Gladden my heart with a letter as soon as you can find
    time.</p>

    THE EVE OF SAINT MARK (Unfinished)</p>

    Upon a Sabbath-day it fell;<br>

    Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell,<br>

    That call'd the folk to evening prayer;<br>

    <p></p>

    The chilly sunset faintly told<br>

    Of unmatur'd green vallies cold,<br>

    Of the green thorny bloomless hedge,<br>

    Of rivers new with spring-time sedge,<br>

    Of primroses by shelter'd rills,<br>

    Of daisies on the aguish hill.<br>

    <p></p>

    Bertha was a maiden fair,<br>

    Dwelling in the old Minister-square;<br>

    From her fire-side she could see,<br>

    Sidelong its rich antiquity,<br>

    Far as the bishop's garden-wall;<br>

    Where sycamores and elm-trees tall,<br>

    Full-leav'd, the forest had outstript,<br>

    By no sharp north-wind ever nipt,<br>

    So shelter'd by the mighty pile.<br>

    <p></p>

    All was silent, all was gloom,<br>

    Abroad and in the homely room;<br>

    Down she sat, poor cheated soul!<br>

    And struck a lamp from dismal coal;<br>

    Lean'd forward, with bright drooping hair,<br>

    And slant book, full against the glare.<br>

    <p></p>

    Untir'd she read, her shadow still<br>

    Glower'd about, as it would fill<br>

    The room with wildest forms and shades,<br>

    As though some ghostly queen of spades<br>

    Had come to mock behind her back,<br>

    And dance, and ruffle her garments black;<br>

    Untir'd she read the legend page,<br>

    Of Holy Mark, from youth to age,<br>

    On land, on sea, in pagan chains,<br>

    Rejoicing for his many pains&hellip;<br>

    <p></p>

    <blockquote>

    JOHN KEATS (1818)</p>

    </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>The imagination may be compared to Adam's dream: &ldquo;He
    awoke and found it truth.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>[Written on the back of the same page]</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>

    AUTUMN<br>

    <p></p>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,<br>

    Close bosom-friend to the maturing sun;<br>

    Conspiring with him how to load and bless<br>

    With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;<br>

    To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,<br>

    And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core.<br>

    Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?<br>

    Think not of them, thou hast thy music too, -<br>

    While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,<br>

    And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue&hellip;<br>
