  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Your letter just arrived, so I know that the mail will reach
    me regularly.</p>

    <p>Some days ago I wrote you a line to tell you a few things
    about the country around here. Everything is beautiful here,
    wherever one goes. The heath is much vaster than in Brabant, at
    least near Zundert or Etten - a little monotonous in the
    afternoon, and especially when the sun shines, but I would not
    miss that very effect, which I tried vainly to paint several
    times. Nor is the sea always picturesque; but those moments and
    effects, too, must be studied if one does not want to be
    deceived in their real character. Then the heath is sometimes
    far from attractive at that hot midday hour - it is
    aggravating, monotonous, and wearying like the desert, as
    inhospitable and hostile, so to speak. Painting it in that
    blazing light and rendering the planes vanishing into infinity
    makes one dizzy.</p>

    <p>However, one must not suppose it has to be taken
    sentimentally; on the contrary, that is what it hardly ever is.
    In the evening when a poor little figure is moving through the
    twilight - when that vast sun-scorched earth stands out darkly
    against the delicate lilac hues of the evening sky, and the
    very last little dark-blue line at the horizon separates the
    earth from the sky - that same aggravating, monotonous spot can
    be as sublime as a Jules Dupr&eacute;. And the figures, the men
    and the women, have that very same characteristic - they are
    not always interesting, but when one looks at them with
    patience, one is sure to discover the Millet-like quality.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I found one of the most curious cemeteries I ever
    saw. Imagine a patch of heath surrounded by a hedge of thickly
    grown little pine trees, so that one would think it just an
    ordinary little pinewood. There is an entrance, however, a
    short avenue, and then one sees a number of graves overgrown
    with grass and heather. Many of them marked with white posts
    bearing the names.</p>

    <p>Herewith a sketch [JH 396] of the study I painted of it [Lost]. I am making
    another study of a red sun between the little birches in a
    marshy meadow, from which the white evening haze is rising, and
    beyond which one can just see at the horizon a bluish-grey line
    of trees with a few roofs.[Lost]</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">It is a pity you have not heard anything from C. M.</p>

    <p>Of course he <i>need</i> not do anything, but I think it
    rather rude never to send a word in reply.</label></p>

    <p>But you must understand one thing - it is increasingly
    apparent to me that we are living in a time in which things
    have got rather mixed up (I personally don't think it
    <i>rather</i> but enormously mixed up, but I won't force that
    opinion on you). As to C. M., he as well as many others would
    be very polite to a stranger, but &ldquo;on ne hait que ses
    amis.&rdquo; [One only hates one's friends.] And as he is quite
    absorbed in the ebb and flow of trade and the art-dealing
    business, he is so engrossed by very abstract things that a
    very natural thing, such as, for instance, the fact that I have
    spoken to him and still do speak to him about my affairs
    strikes him as disagreeably as an open door that lets in a
    draught, for his thoughts are far, far away - always - and he
    knows no better than to free himself rather roughly, just as
    one slams the draughty door.</p>

    <p>You will say that I suppose him to be very inconsiderate.
    Well, that is exactly what I do suppose, though I do not doubt
    that he <i>can</i> be very pleasant, but only when he has his
    attention fixed on the matter, which is certainly <i>not so</i>
    in my case, the more so because he seems to have certain
    unshakable opinions about me which I do not think I must try to
    change.</p>

    <p>I hope to send you studies from here soon, when I have got
    some together; and just think over whether some of them would
    perhaps be the thing for Wisselingh.</p>

    <p>My money is almost gone, and strictly speaking I had hoped
    to be able to lay in a small stock of colours and other
    materials, but well - we must cut our coat according to our
    cloth - though it's a pity there isn't a little more cloth. But
    by working on patiently, things may be mended. I am very glad
    though that I am here, for, boy, it is very beautiful.</p>

    <p>I am longing to hear more from you. Perhaps I understand
    some things a little, but, above all, I know and trust you have
    acted well.</p>

    <p>As for acting well, our circumstances sometimes make us
    different from what we should be if our intentions were not
    thwarted.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.guilt">Personally, I would rather have stayed with the woman,
    though it would have been doubly difficult; but as far as I
    could see, it was impossible under the circumstances. And if I
    constantly imagine her as a phantom, it is not as a reproachful
    one, but I am melancholy because I did not have the means to
    act toward her as I should have wished. Times are hard, and you
    will have your share of it.</label></p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">When I came here, I had with me a number of half-used tubes
    and a few new ones, just enough for about six studies, but
    certainly no more. So with the next money I will order some at
    once, enough for a few more studies.</label> For the rest, I am
    drawing, but you know quite well that painting must be the main
    thing as much as possible.</p>

    <p>I don't know how I shall manage to get the money changed
    here. If it can't be done here, I might get it changed in
    Assen, but if you could arrange it so that, say, twice - till I
    know my way around better and have found a bank in Assen, where
    I have not yet been - if twice you could send me Dutch money
    or, for instance, a postal order, that would be a good thing;
    otherwise, I might not know how to manage.</p>

    <p>I hope you will be able to send no later than September 20,
    for I paid a week in advance as soon as I arrived here, so
    another will be due, and I shall have to pay again.</p>

    <p>On the back of the page you will find a sketch of the little
    churchyard. The colouring there is very unusual. It is very
    beautiful to see the real heather on the graves. The smell of
    turpentine has something mystical about it, the dark stretch of
    pine wood border separates a sparkling sky from the rugged
    earth, which has a generally ruddy hue - fawn - brownish,
    yellowish, but everywhere with lilac tones.</p>

    <p>It was not easy to paint. I will try some more aspects of
    it; with snow, for instance, it must be very curious.</p>

    <p>I had already heard something about Liebermann, but your
    description, especially of his technique, gives me a better
    idea of him. His colour must be <i>infinitely</i> better than
    Henkes's (you express it very well &rdquo;slate colour
    dissolving into greyish-yellow and greyish-brown&rdquo;). I
    understand it perfectly. <i>That</i> way of painting is
    delightful if one has mastered it. And the reason I want to
    paint a great deal is just because I should like to have a
    certain firmness and system in my technique (though I have
    heard many people say you must not have a system).</p>

    <p>But he and several others have it, all right. From your
    description I see that he, Liebermann, must work somewhat in
    Herkomer's manner. Especially in systematically carrying
    through and analyzing those patches of light and shadow caused
    by sunbeams coming through the leaves, which dazzle many an
    eye.</p>

    <p>The other day I saw the large engraving after Herkomer's
    &ldquo;The Last Muster.&rdquo; I suppose you have seen it too -
    what a manly thing! I should love to see the &ldquo;Fille d'un
    mineur&rdquo; by Jules Breton. There is still a coal mine in
    Courri&egrave;res. When I went there on a rainy day, the miners
    were just going home through the mud, like a caravan of chimney
    sweeps; I remember one with an old capote, but the women, at
    least the ones I saw, did not wear men's clothes the way they
    do in the Borinage, where the &ldquo;loques de fosse&rdquo;
    [the &ldquo;pit rags&rdquo;] are the same for everybody.</p>

    </p>

    <p>Well, boy, your letter will be very welcome again. If you
    have not done so already, write a little word to C. M. to tell
    him that I am now <i>alone</i> here in Drenthe, and mention
    something about my plans. But if he does not answer, I think I
    must give it up.</p>

    <p>Thanks for all the trouble you have taken.</p>

    <p>It is beautiful grey weather this morning, no sun for the
    first time since I got here; but for all that, it will be just
    as fine, so I am going to set out. The people with whom I board
    are excellent; the man works at the railway depot, the fellow
    has something De Groux-like about him - a face that sometimes
    has the colour of red cabbage, a real coolie; the woman, very
    active and neat; 3 children. Probably they will give me a back
    garret for a studio. Goodbye, brother, best wishes, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>You know the address is: A. Hartsuiker, Innkeeper,
    Hoogeveen.</p>
