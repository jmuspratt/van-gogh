  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">It is awfully good of you to send me all the paints I
    ordered; I have just received them, but have not yet had time
    to check them.</label></p>

    <p>I am so glad to have them. And the weather today has been
    fine. This morning I worked on an orchard of plum trees in
    bloom; all at once a fierce wind sprang up, an effect I had
    seen nowhere else but here, and returned at intervals. The sun
    shone in between, and all the little white flowers
    sparkled.</p>

    <p>It was so lovely. My friend the Dane came to join me, and I
    went on painting at the risk and peril of seeing the whole show
    on the ground at any moment - it's <art id=0403>a white effect with a good
    deal of yellow in it, and blue and lilac, the sky white and
    blue</art>. But as to the execution of what one
    paints outside like this, what will people say? Well, we shall
    see.</p>

    <p>Then after dinner<art id=0571> I set to work </art>on <art id=0397>the same picture that
    Tersteeg is to have (the &ldquo;Pont de l'Anglais&rdquo;</art>) for
    you. And I have a good mind to make a replica
    of the one for Jet Mauve as well, for I spend so much, we must
    never lose sight of the need to get back the money that flies
    so fast.</p>

    <p>I was sorry afterward not to have asked old Tanguy for the
    paints all the same, not that there would be the least
    advantage in doing so - on the contrary - but he's such a funny
    old soul, and I still think of him many a time. Don't forget to
    say hello for me if you see him, and tell him that if he wants
    pictures for his window, he can have some from here, and the
    best at that.<label content="attitude.people"> Oh! It seems to me more and more that
    <i>people</i> are the root of everything, and though it will
    always be a melancholy thought that you yourself are not in
    real life, I mean, that it's more worth while to work in flesh
    and blood itself than in paint or plaster, more worth while to
    make children than pictures or carry on business, all the same
    you feel that you're alive when you remember that you have
    friends who are outside real life as much as you.</label></p>

    <p>But just because it's what people have in their hearts that
    matters, and it is at the heart of all business dealings too,
    we must make friendships in Holland, or rather revive them.
    More especially since, as far as the Impressionists cause is
    concerned, there is little fear now that we shall not win.</p>

    <p>And because of the victory already almost assured, we must
    have good manners, and do everything quietly.</p>

    <p>I would have greatly liked to see Marat's
    &ldquo;Incarnation&rdquo; which you spoke of the other day; it
    would certainly interest me a lot. Instinctively I think of
    Marat as the equivalent --in character (only more powerful) of
    Xantippe - the woman of a soured love. She remains a touching
    figure all the same - but I admit, not so gay as the Tellier
    household in Guy de Maupassant.</p>

    <p>Has de Lautrec finished his picture of the woman leaning on
    her elbows on a little table in a caf&eacute;?</p>

    <p>If I can manage to learn to work our studies from nature on
    a fresh canvas, we should profit by it, as far as a likelihood
    of selling is concerned. I hope to manage it here, and that's
    why I'm experimenting with the two pictures which are to go to
    Holland, so that you will have them too, and then it won't be
    unbusinesslike.</p>

    <p>You were right to tell Tasset that he must put in the
    geranium lake all the same; he has sent it, I have just checked
    it. <i>All the colours that the Impressionists have brought
    into fashion are unstable</i>, so there is all the more reason
    not to be afraid to lay them on too crudely - time will tone
    them down only too much.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">So, of all the colours I ordered, the three chromes (orange,
    yellow, citron-yellow), the Prussian blue, the emerald, the
    crimson lakes, the Malachite green, or the orange lead, hardly
    one of them is to be found on the Dutch palette, in Maris,
    Mauve, or Isra&euml;ls</label>. They are only to be found in Delacroix,
    who had a passion for the two colours which are most condemned,
    and with most reason, citron-yellow and Prussian blue. All the
    same, I think he did superb things with them - the blues and
    the citron-yellows.</p>

    <p>A handshake for you and Koning, and once again thank you
    very much for the paints.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
