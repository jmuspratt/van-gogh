  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I want to tell you in a few words something which our minds
    are full of these days. My mother had a pretty serious accident
    getting off the train - she broke her right
    thighbone.<sup>1</sup> The setting of the fracture went off
    rather smoothly; she is quiet and does not suffer much pain.
    But I need not tell you that we are all greatly worried about
    it.</p>

    <p><Label content="attitude.sisters">Now I am glad I am here, as my sisters are physically weak
    too, and I can easily find something useful to do. My sisters
    are well enough otherwise; the one who is usually at
    Soesterberg is the weaker of the two. I can hardly find words
    to describe how bravely the sister who was at home when you
    were staying with us is bearing up these days.</label></p>

    <p>My mother will require a lot of nursing - the doctor assures
    us that she <i>can</i>recover completely - but <i>under the
    most favourable circumstances</i> it will take at least half a
    year before she can walk again and even then that leg will be
    shorter than the other one.</p>

    <p>Just imagine that at present there is no doctor here in the
    village (at least my father will have nothing to do with the
    one there is), and so a doctor from Eindhoven must come in a
    cab every now and then.</p>

    <p>It certainly is a calamity - the consequences of which I
    think are hard to foresee. Well, of course we must live from
    day to day, as sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.</p>

    <p>Fortunately she is quiet and clear-headed about it, so that
    she is co-operating to preserve the necessary calm.</p>

    <p>Please write me soon. Have you started something new since I
    saw you?</p>

    <p>I am still working on the weavers, but I'm afraid I'll be
    able to work only half time for a while on account of the
    unfortunate event, which has resulted in a lot of other things
    to do.</p>

    <p>As I wrote you, I have done several watercolour studies
    direct from nature. I am going to start more elaborate
    watercolours after them, for I have to stay at home most of the
    time these days.</p>

    <p>My mother and father join me in sending you kind regards. My
    mother had taken the train from Nuenen to Helmond in the
    morning just to do some shopping. As she was getting off the
    train in the station at Helmond, she seems to have missed her
    footing. They had to take her home by carriage. It is indeed
    fortunate that, considering this transportation, things haven't
    turned out much worse, and that the setting of the fracture
    went off so well (though it was bad enough, considered by
    itself). But all the same - a lot remains to be done.</p>

    <p>Write soon if you can. With a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
