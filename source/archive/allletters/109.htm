  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It was a delightful sensation to hear Gladwell's voice in
    the hall while I sat working in my room upstairs, and to see
    him enter a moment later, and to shake hands with him.
    Yesterday we took a long walk through the principal streets and
    past most of the churches; this morning we got up before five
    o'clock to see the workmen enter the yard, and then we walked
    to Zeeburg. We have been to the Trippenhuis twice, and he went
    alone to Van der Hoop's; he was also at Uncle Cor's gallery
    (but Uncle was out of town) and went with me to Mendes's. Now
    we intend to go to Uncle Stricker's (for I am asked there for
    dinner today, and will risk bringing him with me). I should
    also like to go with him to Haarlem to see the pictures by
    Frans Hals, and now he is going there and not to Antwerp as he
    intended; he'll go to Belgium another time, and limit himself
    to Holland now.</p>

    <p>We also spent a great deal of time in my little study and
    talked about many things, new and old. Once more as he sits
    here beside me, I experience the same feeling that drew me to
    him so often - as if he were a son of the same house and a
    brother in faith because he loves the &ldquo;man of sorrows,
    and acquainted with grief&rdquo; Who is our God and in Whose
    teachings and resurrection we believe, Whose spirit we seek,
    and Whose love we beg, that it may suffuse our entire being
    throughout life and that nothing may ever separate us from it -
    neither things present, nor things to come. The sorrowing unto
    God will bring about in him what it has brought about in many
    men - and is bringing about and shall bring about - that
    never-to-be-lamented choice of the good part, which shall not
    be taken away, and the one thing needful to choose; bringing
    forth the fruits of repentance, worthiness of conversion. He is
    a Christian and will become more and more so. This morning we
    read together the story of Elijah by the brook Cherith and in
    the house of the widow woman, for when we were fellow boarders
    in Montmartre, we found that the barrel of meal did not waste,
    nor the cruse of water fail; and yesterday evening, the parable
    of the sower, and more.</p>

    <p>Now he will spend some days with you and is looking forward
    to seeing your little room and the prints you have.</p>

    <p>He gave me Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, which is as great an
    acquisition as Bossuet's Oraisons Fun&egrave;bres, which I
    bought very cheaply sometime ago, and a Latin edition of
    Imitation by Thomas a Kempis which Vos gave me and which I hope
    to be able to read in the original someday. He read several
    bits here of Bungener, Esquiros, Lamennais, Souvestre,
    Lamartine (Cromwell) and has enjoyed the lithographs after
    Bosboom; we bought one from a Jew, and he has asked me to buy
    some more for him when I get the chance.</p>

    <p>I do hope you have a pleasant evening with him, and I
    believe that the more you try to find in him, the more you will
    find.</p>

    <p>We talked about many things, and the gist of it was: Many
    people, arriving at the moment in life when they must make a
    choice, have chosen for their part &ldquo;the love of Christ
    and poverty,&rdquo; or rather, &ldquo;give me neither poverty
    or riches; feed me with food convenient for me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The time passed only too quickly for me, and I wished that
    we might have been together longer; but that was impossible -
    each of us must go his different way and continue to do
    whatever comes to hand, according to his call. For my part, I
    am thankful from the bottom of my heart that it has been given
    me to see him again and to find in him still what first
    attracted me. He told me that you would certainly go on that
    business trip in at least four weeks, so I hope to see you
    again, too. With all my heart I hope he will keep a pleasant
    and good memory of his stay in Holland; it was brave of him to
    carry out his plan in spite of objections.</p>

    <p>Give my regards to the Roos family, have a pleasant evening
    with Gladwell and imagine a firm handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>I suppose you have learned that Mrs. Richard is dead; it
    must have been a fearful night.</p>

    <p>Would it not be very desirable to know the Bible well and
    thoroughly and lovingly?</p>
