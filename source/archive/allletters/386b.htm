  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter and the money.</p>

    <p>Assuming what you say is true, namely that you have
    repeatedly started to write to me, but that you did not succeed
    in finishing the letter - well, I find myself in the same
    situation, for twice already I have thrown away what I had
    written into the fire, because <i>I thought it either too
    bitter or too sad</i>. What shall I say to you? Your letter
    sounds very correct, and has the tone of a <i>good</i> ministre
    des Beaux Arts.</p>

    <p>But this does not alter the fact that it is not much use to
    me, and that I am not satisfied with it - and especially in
    your &ldquo;later on, when you have expressed yourself more
    clearly, we shall <i>perhaps</i> find something in your present
    work, and then we shall not act as we do now&hellip;&rdquo; I
    see only a fair promise - but in reality a ministerial fata
    morgana in the eyes of a fellow like me, who would rather find
    an outlet for his work in a more <i>pedestrian</i> way,
    provided that it is <i>at the present moment</i>.</p>

    <p>There you are - <i>if need be</i> an outlet at the present
    moment, but preferably not with third-class dealers - and this
    is something I cannot demand of you, considering your position
    - que soit - but on the other hand you cannot demand of me that
    I resign myself to a ministerial fata morgana. After all, I am
    too practical for that!</p>

    <p>Kindly appreciate that I call you a <i>good minister</i> -
    and you know well enough how damned bad the fellows elevated
    above solid ground are as a rule, so that I am only too happy
    to value a few bright spots even in the ministerial sphere.
    Which is not being intransigent, and which is really why I piss
    on the sanctuary of the intransigent fellows - which I do once
    in a while - on sanctuaries in general.</p>

    <p>But to business - do you realise that at present my expenses
    amount to two guilders a day; take one guilder for models and
    one for canvas, colours, etc. - I cannot do it cheaper - I
    still have some bills to pay and - I have to go to Antwerp.</p>

    <p>My situation here is a bit too tense, right now my life is
    not pleasant, and I do not find it easy to possess my soul in
    patience, as they say.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">At home - even though there are no rows - they do not think
    the prospect of my staying here <i>too</i> long very cheerful.
    Which I can well understand.</label></p>

    <p>And yet I cannot go away - either leaving completely or
    partly (by &ldquo;partly&rdquo; I mean keeping on my studio,
    which is my intention) - unless I go on making a lot of studies
    and find something new by way of security in Antwerp.</p>

    <p>Be so kind as to take this into consideration. And if you
    should be willing to do your best on the financial side, so
    that things will be somewhat easier for me, I believe there
    will be a chance of keeping the peace in the future, though it
    will be far from real <i>harmony</i>.</p>

    <p>Which I wish for myself as well as for others, this
    composure I mean. With regard to my work you say what is not
    there may turn up yet - and I say the same about the fata
    morgana in your saying &ldquo;later on&hellip;we shall perhaps,
    etc.&rdquo; - (see above).</p>

    <p>At present - it is a fata morgana to me, and at all events I
    want to try Antwerp.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
