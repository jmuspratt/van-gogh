  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your nice letter, and also for that page from
    Michelet; I have copied it on the back of the map of Normandy
    and Brittany. How noble and beautiful it is - with a peculiar,
    weird beauty, the finest expression of which we find in that
    story of Elijah near the brook Kishon and with the widow - it
    is written in simplicity of heart and simpleness of mind by one
    who was sorrowful yet always rejoicing.</p>

    <p>I am glad you are going to the library to see those maps by
    Stieler and Spr&uuml;ner Menke; they have the same kind of
    beauty. Last night I was at Uncle Cor's and looked at them
    again; when you look through the Atlas, notice also the maps of
    Denmark, Sweden and Norway and especially that of Greece.</p>

    <p>Father wrote from Brussels, and later wired both the uncles
    to come. When the letter came, Uncle Jan had just gone to the
    Leidsestraat <sup>1</sup>, and I went there, too, to bring him
    the letter, though rather afraid that Uncle might have just
    gone home and that we should miss each other. On the Dam I
    found Uncle standing under the light of a street lamp, waiting
    for a bus. We then entered the parcels express office of v.
    Gend &amp; Loos there on the Dam and read the letter. Next day
    they both left for Brussels.</p>

    <p>Uncle Cor has already come back. Things in Brussels are
    very, very sad. When one hears such things - so terrible, and
    yet they may befall us too, for what are we, and what
    distinguishes us? - one begins rather to realize why He said,
    &ldquo;If a man hate not his life, he cannot be my
    disciple,&rdquo; for there is reason to hate that life, and
    what is called &ldquo;this body of death.&rdquo; And with
    reason it is written, &ldquo;Si vous d&eacute;sirez apprendre
    et savoir utilement quelque chose, aimez &agrave; rester
    inconnu at &agrave; n'&ecirc;tre compt&eacute; pour rien, et
    l'&eacute;tude la plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e et la plus utile,
    c'est de se bien conna&icirc;tre et de se
    m&eacute;priser&rdquo; [If you want to learn and have a useful
    knowledge of something, prefer to remain unknown and to be
    counted for nothing; the most sublime and useful study is to
    know oneself well, and to despise oneself.]</p>

    <p>I had to draw for Mendes a map of ancient Italy, or rather
    two, for I drew also one of middle Italy, just about from Rome
    to Naples.</p>

    <p>When I saw Uncle Jan standing on the Dam that evening, his
    figure reminded me of Landseer's &ldquo;The Highlander&rdquo;
    (or is that engraving called &ldquo;The Mountain
    Top&rdquo;?).</p>

    <p>This week I paid a visit to the Reverend Mr. Jeremie Meyes.
    I went there when it was raining, hoping to find him at home,
    but he was out; perhaps he had gone to visit somebody else for
    the same reason. But his wife was at home, and was sewing in a
    little room, like the little back room in Etten (but this one
    looks out on the street). She reminds me of Mrs. Jones. They
    are such nice people; I ran into them lately at a lecture, and
    they differed from the other people like an old moss-covered
    apple tree or a rosebush differs from all kinds of unnatural
    exotic plants.</p>

    <p>Uncle Cor told me about the walk he took with Uncle Jan in
    the Bois de Cambre - you know its gnarled brushwood and trees
    with their weird forms; the sky was stormy, with big clouds
    reflected in the pools on the ground. It has been a deeply
    melancholy journey for them both, and for Father also. On the
    ninth day there is sometimes a change in such a condition;
    Uncle Jan will wait for that, and will probably stay until
    Monday.</p>

    <p>The tidings from Prinsenhage are not very favourable
    either.</p>

    <p>Next month I hope to send you the little book about the
    Crusades by Gruson; when you have read it, we can give it to
    Father together.</p>

    <p>And so Brion is dead too; well, he left some beautiful work
    behind. Do you know his &ldquo;Un enterrement sur les bords du
    Rhin&rdquo; [A Funeral on the Banks of the Rhine], an old
    picture? I also like the one at the Luxembourg,
    &ldquo;Noah,&rdquo; so much; how many things has he done! He
    had a great talent and has made the most of it, and gained by
    it. There are many illustrations by him in the illustrated
    edition of Erckmann-Chatrian. &ldquo;The Invasion&rdquo; is
    also one of his most beautiful pictures.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow Martyn Aerssen is going to be married, and Father
    will officiate. Aerssen is a fine man - Brion would have
    painted him well.</p>

    <p>If you find in the store an old lithograph, &ldquo;A Church
    Meeting Somewhere in Lapland,&rdquo; and also the pendant by
    Meyer van Bremen, &ldquo;Mothers with Children&rdquo; - they
    are hanging at home - please put them aside and tell me what
    they cost.</p>

    <p>How beautiful that portrait of De Ruyter is; it's an old
    aquatint, which hangs in Uncle's room. I look at it so often;
    it has a stormy or thundery expression, a look such as I think
    Cromwell must have had.</p>

    <p>At Uncle Cor's I saw a new engraving after Erskine Nicol,
    &ldquo;Sabbath,&rdquo; an old woman going home in the rain; it
    is very fine and well engraved.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow morning I shall go to the little English church I
    told you about. In the evening it lies so peacefully in that
    quiet Beguinage, between the hawthorn hedges; it seems to say,
    &ldquo;In loco isto dabo pacem,&rdquo; which means, In this
    place I will give peace, saith the Lord.</p>

    <p>The view of the yard in the morning is intriguing now that
    the sun rises so late in the dark days before Christmas and the
    workmen do not arrive until seven o'clock. It is stormy
    outside; we have quite enough wind and rain these days.</p>

    <p>In studying the history of Ancient Rome, I read that if a
    crow or an eagle landed on the head of anyone, it was a sign
    that heaven approved of them and blessed them. It is good to
    know this history; I am happy because it has given me a chance
    to understand what happened during this time.</p>

    <p>Uncle Cor has offered me A Child's history of England by
    Dickens; I don't remember if I have written you that this book
    is fine gold, and that I have read notably the description of
    the Battle of Hastings. I know that when one attentively reads
    books of this genre, for example Motley, Dickens, and Gruson's
    Les Croisades, they convey to us a simplified but precise idea
    of history in general.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">Old son, if I can pass my examinations, it will be a
    blessing! If I pass the first examination with all those
    subjects which seem simple but are difficult enough, I shall
    have good courage for what must follow&hellip;</label></p>

    <p>I must set to work now, Latin exercises for tomorrow morning
    and other things. Write me soon if you can, and have as good a
    time as possible. I hope to have copied a few more of those
    maps by Stieler before Christmas. Now I am studying, though it
    may cost a little more effort, <i>it must be done well</i>, and
    I will try to do it the way I see others who take their work
    seriously do; <i>it is a race and a fight for my life</i> - no
    more, no less. Whoever gets through this course of study and
    perseveres in it to the end will not forget it as long as he
    lives; to have done this will be something to treasure.</p>

    <p>What a good employee that Wierda is; he is very clever too,
    I think. There are a great many nice people in the book
    business; Uncle Cor, Mr. Braat, Schr&ouml;der here (that is
    where Mendes gets his books, and I, too, sometimes). One might
    also count Mr. Tersteeg among them, and you, too, are in it;
    hold on to what you have, for you are also in the battle.</p>

    <p>My compliments to the Roos family; &agrave; Dieu, boy, we
    must try to travel together at Christmas. A warm handshake in
    thought from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
