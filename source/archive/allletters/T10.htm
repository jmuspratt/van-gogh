    <p>Letter T10<br>
     Paris, 16 June 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>It is a very, very long time since I ought to have written
    you a letter, but I have not been able to formulate my
    thoughts. There are moments when one's feelings are clear, but
    sometimes it is difficult to form an idea of what has taken
    shape in one's thoughts and what is still in a state of
    vagueness. I am also not sure of being able to write you in the
    way I should like to today, <sup>1</sup> but my letter will be
    sent off anyway, if only to let you know that we think of you
    often, and that your last pictures have given me much food for
    thought on the state of your mind at the time you did them. In
    all of them there is a vigour in the colours which you have not
    achieved before - this in itself constitutes a rare quality -
    but you have gone further than that, and if there are some who
    try to find the symbolic by torturing the form, I find this in
    many of your canvases, namely in the expression of the epitome
    of your thoughts on nature and living creatures, which you feel
    to be so strongly inherent in them. But how your brain must
    have laboured, and how you have risked everything to the very
    limit, where vertigo is inevitable!</p>

    <p>For this reason, my dear brother, when you tell me that you
    are working again, in which from one point of view I rejoice,
    for by this you avoid lapsing into the state of mind which many
    of the poor wretches who are taken care of in the establishment
    where you are staying succumb to, it worries me a little to
    think about it, for you ought not to venture into the
    mysterious regions which it seems one may skim cautiously but
    not penetrate with impunity before you recover completely.
    Don't take more trouble than necessary, for if you do nothing
    more than simply tell the story of what you see, there will be
    enough qualities in it to make your pictures last. Think of all
    the still lifes and the flowers which Delacroix painted when he
    went to the country to stay with George Sand. It is true that
    after that he had a reversal, when he did the &ldquo;Education
    of the Virgin,&rdquo; and who can tell whether you will not
    produce a masterpiece later if you do as I say? But arrange
    your work in such a way that you do not overexert yourself. As
    you know, there is an exhibition at a caf&eacute; &agrave;l'esposition <sup>2</sup>
    where Gauguin and some others (Schuffenecker) are exhibiting pictures. At first I had
    said you would exhibit some things, too, but they assumed an
    air of being such tremendous fellows that it made one sick. Yet
    Schuffenecker claims that this manifestation will eclipse all
    the other painters, and if they had let him have his way, he
    would have paraded all over Paris adorned with flags of all
    manner of colours to show he was the great conqueror. It gave
    one somewhat the impression of going to the Universal
    Exhibition by the back stairs. As always, there were
    exclusions. Lautrec, who had exhibited with a Centre, was not
    allowed to be in it, and so on. The other day a sketch by
    Rembrandt was sold at a public auction; I wish you could have
    seen it. It is the figure of the Angel Gabriel, standing, as he
    is in the heaven of his etching &ldquo;The Annunciation to the
    Shepherds.&rdquo; What a marvel! The colour has remained quite
    clear; perhaps originally it was all yellow. The shadows were
    much more coloured than was his habit, and were probably a very
    pronounced blue, green and violet, but the general effect and
    the harmony are exquisite.</p>

    <p>Those who hold out best at the big exhibition are Corot,
    Manet, Delacroix, Millet, Ricard, and especially Daumier. They
    had hung Degas too, but he has had his pictures removed.</p>

    <p>Gauguin went off to Pont-Aven two weeks ago, so he has not
    seen your pictures. Isa&auml;cson thinks very highly
    of your last consignment. I shall send you back <art id=0482>the bedroom</art>,
    but you must not think of retouching this canvas if you can
    repair the damage. Copy it, and then send back this one, so
    that I can have it re-canvassed. <art id=0495>The red vine</art> is very
    beautiful; I have hung it in one of our rooms. I am also very
    fond of that <art id=0489>vertical portrait of a woman</art>. I had a visit from a
    certain Polack, who knows Spain and the pictures there well. He
    said it was as fine as one of the great Spaniards.</p>

    <p>Good health and a handshake from Jo and Theo.</p>
