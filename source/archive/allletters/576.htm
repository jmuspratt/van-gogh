  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="health.fatigue">I should have preferred to reply at once to your kind letter
    containing the 100 francs, but since at that precise moment I
    was very tired and the doctor had given me strict instructions
    to go out for walks and make no mental exertion, I haven't
    written to you until today.</label></p>

    <p>As far as work is concerned, this month hasn't been bad on
    the whole, and as the work takes my mind off things, or rather
    keeps me in order, I don't deprive myself of it.</p>

    <p>I have done<art id=0505> &ldquo;La Berceuse&rdquo;</art> <art id=0506>three</art>
    <art id=0508>times</art>, and
    seeing that Mme. Roulin was the model and I only the painter, I
    let her choose between the three, her and her husband, on
    condition, however, that I could do a duplicate for myself of
    the one she chose, which I am working on at present.</p>

    <p>You ask if I have read La Mireille by Mistral - I am like
    you, I can only read the extracts that have been translated.
    But what about you, have you heard it yet, for perhaps you know
    that Gounod has set it to music. At least I think so. I don't
    know the music, of course, and even if I did go to hear it, I
    should be watching the musicians rather than listening.</p>

    <p>But I can tell you this, that the local dialect spoken here
    sounds so musical in the mouths of the Arl&eacute;siennes that
    I actually pick up snatches of it every now and then.</p>

    <p>Perhaps there is an attempt at a medley of local colour in
    &ldquo;La Berceuse.&rdquo; It's badly painted, and in a sense
    cheap chromos are infinitely better done, but even
    so&hellip;</p>

    <p>Here, the so-called worthy town of Arles is such a peculiar
    sort of place that it is with good reason our friend Gauguin
    calls it the filthiest spot in the South. Now, if Rivet saw the
    population, he'd certainly have some bad moments, and repeat
    over and over again, &ldquo;You're in a sorry state, the lot of
    you,&rdquo; just as he says of us. Still, once you've had the
    local disease, you'll never catch it again.</p>

    <p>Which is just to let you know that as far as I am concerned,
    I have no illusions about myself. Things are going very, very
    well, and I'll do everything the doctor says, but&hellip;</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">When I came out of hospital with good old Roulin, I fancied
    there'd been nothing wrong with me, it was only
    <i>afterwards</i> I felt I'd been ill. Well, that's only to be
    expected, I have moments when I am twisted with enthusiasm or
    madness or prophecy, like a Greek oracle on his tripod. I
    display great presence of mind then in my words, and speak like
    the Arl&eacute;siennes, but in spite of all that, my spirits
    are very low. Especially when my physical strength returns. But
    I've already told Rey that at the first sign of a serious
    symptom I would come back and submit myself to the alienists in
    Aix, or to himself.</label></p>

    <p>What else except pain and suffering can we expect if we are
    not well, you and I?</p>

    <p>Our ambition has been dashed so low. So let us work very
    calmly, look after ourselves as best we can, and not exhaust
    ourselves in futile attempts at mutual generosity. You do your
    duty and I will do mine, and as far as that's concerned, we've
    both already paid for it - and not just in words - and at the
    end of the road we may quietly come together again. But when I
    am in a delirium and everything I love so much is in turmoil,
    then I don't mistake that for reality, and I don't play the
    false prophet.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.death">Indeed, illness or death holds no terror for me, but happily
    for us, ambition is not compatible with the callings we follow.</label>
    There are so many people in all classes of society, from the
    highest to the lowest, who believe that, anyway.</p>

    <p>But why are you thinking about your marriage contract and
    the possibility of dying just now? Wouldn't it be better simply
    to run your woman through instead? After all, that's normal
    practice in the North, and it's not for me to say that
    practices in the North are no good.</p>

    <p>It'll all come all right in the end, believe me.</p>

    <p>But I, without a penny to my name, I still say that when it
    comes down to it, money is one kind of currency and painting is
    another. And I am even ready to send you a consignment along
    the lines mentioned in previous letters. And it will get
    better. If my strength returns.</p>

    <p>So, if Gauguin, who is completely infatuated with<art id=0454> my</art>
    <art id=0455>sunflowers</art>, takes these two pictures, I should just like him to
    give your fianc&eacute;e or you a couple of pictures of his,
    not second-rate ones but better than that. And should he take a
    copy of &ldquo;La Berceuse,&rdquo; then all the more reason for
    him to give a good one in return. Otherwise I wouldn't be able
    to complete the series I spoke to you about, which should be
    fit to go on show in that same little display window we have
    gazed at so often.</p>

    <p>In this case, the value of the pictures does not come into
    it, and I don't claim to be an expert. It remains a fact,
    however, that I may be entitled to attach as much importance to
    my social position as you do to yours as a loyal employee. And
    let me just say this: I think as much of brotherly integrity
    when it comes to Boussod's money as you do. It has never played
    us false. And we have sweated far too much doing good work to
    get annoyed at being called thieves or incompetents.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I won't keep on about it.</p>

    <p>As for the Ind&eacute;pendants, it seems to me that six
    pictures are too many by half. To my mind, The
    <art id=0412>&ldquo;Harvest&rdquo;</art> and <art id=0403>the &ldquo;White
    Orchard&rdquo;</art> are enough, with the
    <art id=0431>&ldquo;Proven&ccedil;ale Girl&rdquo;</art> or the
    <art id=0422>&ldquo;Sower&rdquo;</art> if you like. But I really
    don't care. The only thing I really want to do some day is to
    give you a more comforting impression of this painting business
    of ours with a collection of about 30 more serious studies. In
    any case that will prove to our real friends like Gauguin,
    Guillaumin, Bernard, etc., that we are producing something.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.people">As for the little yellow house, when I paid my rent the
    landlord's agent was very kind and behaved like an
    Arl&eacute;sien, treating me as an equal.</p>

    <p>So I told him that I had no need of a lease, nor of a
    written assurance of preference, and that in the event of my
    being ill payment would only be made by friendly
    arrangement.</p>

    <p>People here have their hearts in the right place and the
    spoken word is more binding than the written word.</label> <label content="health.mental">So I shall
    keep the house on for the time being, as I need to feel that
    this is my home if I am to regain my mental health.</label></p>

    <p>Now about your moving from the Rue Lepic to the Rue Rodier,
    I can't offer any opinion, as I haven't seen it, but the main
    thing is that you too will be lunching at home with your wife.
    By staying in Montmartre you would all the sooner get decorated
    and be a Minister of Arts, but as you are not too keen on that,
    it is better to have the peace of one's own home, so I think
    you are quite right.</p>

    <p>I am a little like that too. <label content="health.mental">I always tell the people here
    who ask after my health that I shall begin by dying in their
    midst, and that then my malady will be dead.</p>

    <p>This doesn't mean I shall not have long spells of respite,
    but once you are ill in earnest, you know quite well that you
    cannot contract the same illness twice, you are well or you are
    ill, just as you are young or old. Like you, I will do what the
    doctor tells me as much as I can, and I consider that as part
    of my work and the duty I have to fulfil.</label></p>

    <p>I must tell you this, that the neighbours, etc., are
    particularly kind to me, as everyone here is suffering either
    from fever, or hallucinations, or madness, we understand each
    other like members of the same family. Yesterday I went to see
    the girl to whom I had gone when I was off my head. They told
    me that there's nothing surprising about things like that in
    this part of the world. She'd been upset and had fainted but
    had regained her composure. And indeed, they spoke well of
    her.</p>

    <p>But it won't do for us to think that I am completely sane.
    The people from round here who are ill like me have told me
    there will always be times when you take leave of your
    senses.</p>

    <p>So I don't ask you to tell people that there is nothing
    wrong with me, or that there never will be. It is just that the
    explanation of all this is probably not Ricord's but Raspail's
    <sup>1</sup>. Though I have not yet had the fevers of the
    region, I might still catch them. But they already know a thing
    or two about all that here at the hospital, and as long as you
    have no false shame and say frankly how you feel, you cannot go
    wrong.</p>

    <p>I am bringing this letter to a close for this evening with a
    good handshake in my thoughts,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
