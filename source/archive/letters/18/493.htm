    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have been thinking about Gauguin,<sup>1</sup> and look
    here. If Gauguin wants to come here, there is Gauguin's
    journey, and there are two beds or two mattresses, which in
    that case we absolutely must buy. But afterward, as Gauguin is
    a sailor, we shall probably manage to eat at home.</p>

    <p>And the two of us will live on the same money that I now
    spend by myself.</p>

    <p>You know that I have always thought it idiotic the way
    painters live alone, etc. You always lose by being
    isolated.</p>

    <p>This is in reply to your wish to get him out of his trouble.
    You can't send him what will keep him going in Brittany and me
    what keeps me going in Provence.</p>

    <p>But you may think it a good idea for us to share, and fix a
    sum - say 250 a month, if every month, besides and in addition
    to my work, you get a Gauguin.</p>

    <p>Provided that we did not exceed this sum, wouldn't it even
    mean a profit?</p>

    <p>Besides, it has always been my idea to join hands with other
    people.</p>

    <p>So here is a rough draft of a letter to Gauguin, which I
    will write, if you approve, with whatever changes that will
    doubtless have to be made in the phrasing. But this is how I
    wrote it first.</p>

    <p>Take the thing as a plain matter of business, that is the
    best way for everyone, and let's treat it squarely as such.
    Only, seeing that you are not in business for yourself, you may
    perhaps see fit to let me take it upon myself, and to let
    Gauguin join in with me as a comrade.</p>

    <p>I judged that you wanted to help him, just as I myself am
    distressed at his being ill, and it's a thing that doesn't get
    better overnight. We cannot suggest something better than this,
    and others would not do so much.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">As for me, it worries me to spend so much money on myself
    alone, but the only way to remedy it is for me to find a woman
    with money, or some fellows who will join me to paint
    pictures.</p>

    <p>I don't see the woman, but I do see the fellows.</label></p>

    <p>If this will suit him, we must not keep him dangling.</p>

    <p>And this would be the beginning of an association. Bernard,
    who is also coming South, will join us, and truly, I can see
    you at the head of an Impressionist Society in France yet. And
    if I can be of any use in getting them together, I would
    willingly look upon them all as better artists than I. You must
    realize how it vexes me to spend more than they do; I must find
    some arrangement more advantageous both for you and to them.
    And it would be so in this case. Think it over carefully, but
    isn't it true that in good company you can live on little,
    provided you spend your money at home?</p>

    <p>Perhaps the time will come when we shall be less hard up,
    but I do not count on it. It would please me so if you had the
    Gauguins first. I am not such a bad hand at cooking, etc., but
    they have had more practice, as they have done their military
    service, etc.</p>

    <p>With a handshake for you and regards to Koning; all the same
    it is a satisfaction to you to hand him over in good condition,
    which is more than he might have been if you hadn't taken him
    in. It is satisfactory, too, that the Goupils have decided to
    take that hall you suggested.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Has Tersteeg come to Paris yet?</p>

    <p>You must think things over very, very, very carefully before
    you start travelling. I think it is very likely that your place
    is in France.</p>

    <p>To prepare the way, and to round off this letter, I wrote to
    Gauguin, but <i>without saying a word</i> of all this, only
    talking about work.</p>

        <p>In a letter dated May 22, 1888, Gauguin had asked Theo's
        help. He had been living on credit at the inn at Pont-Aven
        for two months already, and he did not see how he could
        extricate himself from his difficulties. This explains
        Vincent's plan to let him come to Arles.</p>
