  <body>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Thank you for having replied; I see that you are in good place
    to study the sun that charms you, and you work so much better when
    you grasp the subject. Thank you again for your good intentions in
    my regard; the painting trade is so hard these days.  </p>

    <p>Because of it I am in a perpetual trance here; money problems are
    the only ones that have any effect on me and unfortunately I believe
    I am always destined to suffer them.  </p>

    <p>At the moment Pont-Aven is very miserable due to bad weather, winds
    and continual rains, and I wait for the good weather to put me back to
    work, which I have abandoned a little due to illness.  </p>

    <p>A cordial handshake, </p>

    <p>Paul Gauguin. </p>

    <p>Pont-Aven - pension Gloanec.  </p>
