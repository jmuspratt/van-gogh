  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>The fine weather of the last few days has gone, and instead
    we have mud and rain. But it's sure to come back again before
    winter. Only one must make the most of it, as the fine days are
    short.</p>

    <p>Especially for painting. This winter I intend to do a lot of
    drawing. If only I could draw figures from memory, I should
    always have something to do. But if you take a figure by the
    most skilful of all the artists who sketch from life - Hokusai,
    or Daumier - in my opinion that figure will never compare to a
    figure painted from the model by those same masters or other
    master portrait painters.</p>

    <p>Anyway - if we are so often fated to go short of models, and
    especially of intelligent models, we mustn't despair or tire of
    the struggle.</p>

    <p>I have arranged all the Japanese prints in the studio, and
    the Daumiers, and the Delacroixs and the G&eacute;ricaults. If
    you come across Delacroix's &ldquo;Pieta&rdquo; again, or the
    G&eacute;ricault, I urge you to get as many of them as you
    can.</p>

    <p>What I should really love to have in the studio as well is
    Millet's &ldquo;Work in the Fields,&rdquo; and Lerat's etching
    of his &ldquo;Sower&rdquo; which Durand-Ruel sells at 1.25
    francs. And lastly the little etching by Jacquemart after
    Meissonier, the &ldquo;Man Reading,&rdquo; a Meissonier I've
    always admired. I cannot help liking Meissonier's things.</p>

    <p>I am reading an article on Tolstoy in the Revue des Deux
    Mondes - it appears that Tolstoy is enormously interested in
    the religion of his people. Like George Eliot in England. I
    believe there is a book on religion by Tolstoy, I think it is
    called My Religion, it's sure to be very good. In it he goes in
    search, or so I gather from the article, of what all religions
    have in common. It seems that he admits neither the
    resurrection of the body, nor even that of the soul, but says,
    like the nihilists, that after death there is nothing else.
    Though man dies, and dies completely, living humanity endures
    forever.</p>

    <p>Anyhow, not having read the book itself, I'm not able to say
    exactly what his conception is, but I don't imagine that his
    religion is a cruel one which increases our suffering, but must
    be, on the contrary, a very comforting one, inspiring one with
    peace of mind, and energy, and the courage to live, and many
    other things.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">I think the drawing of the &ldquo;Blade of Grass&rdquo; and
    the carnations and the Hokusai in Bing's reproductions are
    <i>admirable</i>.</p>

    <p>But whatever they say, the most ordinary Japanese prints,
    coloured in flat tones, seem admirable to me for the same
    reason as Rubens and Veronese. I know perfectly well that they
    are not primitive art. But just because the primitives are so
    admirable, there is absolutely no reason for me to say, as is
    becoming the custom, &ldquo;When I go to the Louvre, I cannot
    get beyond the primitives.&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>If I said to a <i>serious</i> collector of Japanese art - to
    Levy himself - &ldquo;My dear sir, I cannot help admiring these
    Japanese prints at 5 sous apiece,&rdquo; it is more than
    probable he would be a little shocked, and would pity my
    ignorance and bad taste. Just as at one time it was considered
    bad taste to admire Rubens, Jordaens, and Veronese.</p>

    <p>I'm sure I shan't end up feeling lonely in the house, and
    that during bad winter days, and the long evenings, I shall
    find something absorbing to do.</p>

    <p>A weaver or a basket maker often spends whole seasons alone,
    or almost alone, with his craft as his only distraction. And
    what makes these people stay in one place is precisely the
    feeling of being at home, <i>the</i> <i>reassuring and familiar
    look of things.</i> Of course I'd welcome company, but it won't
    make me unhappy if I don't have it, and anyway, the time will
    come when I will have someone, I have little doubt of that.</p>

    <p>I'm sure that if you were willing to put people up in your
    house too, you would find plenty of artists for whom the
    question of lodgings is a very serious problem.</p>

    <p>For my part I think that it is absolutely my duty to try to
    make money by my work, and so I see my work very clear before
    me.</p>

    <p>Oh, if only every artist had something to live on, and to
    work on, but as that is not so, I want to produce, to produce a
    lot and with a consuming drive. And perhaps the time will come
    when we can extend our business and be more help to the
    others.</p>

    <p>But that is a long way off and there is a lot of work to get
    through first.</p>

    <p>If you lived in time of war, you might possibly have to
    fight; you would regret it, you would lament that you weren't
    living in times of peace, but after all the necessity would be
    there and you would fight.</p>

    <p>And in the same way we certainly have the right to wish for
    a state of things in which money would not be necessary in
    order to live.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">However, as everything is done by means of money now, one
    has got to think about making it so long as one spends it, but
    I have more chance of making it by painting than by drawing. On
    the whole there are a good many more people who can do clever
    sketches than there are who can paint readily and can get at
    nature through colour. That will always be rarer, and whether
    the pictures are a long time in being appreciated or not, they
    will find a collector some day.</label></p>

    <p>As for the pictures done in fairly thick impasto, I think
    they need longer to dry out <i>here</i>. I've read that the
    works of Rubens in Spain have remained infinitely richer in
    colour than those in the North. Even the ruins here exposed to
    the open air remain white, whereas in the north they turn grey,
    dirty, black, etc. You may be sure that if the Monticellis had
    dried in Paris, they would be very much duller by now.</p>

    <p>I am beginning to appreciate the beauty of the women here
    better, so my thoughts return to Monticelli over and over
    again. Colour plays a tremendous part in the beauty of these
    women - I'm not saying that their figures are not beautiful,
    but that is not the native charm. That is to be found in the
    grand lines of the colourful costume, worn just right, and in
    the tone of the flesh rather than the shape. It won't be easy
    doing them the way I'm beginning to feel about them. But what I
    am sure of is that by staying here I shall make some progress.
    And in order to do a picture which is really of the South, a
    little skill is not enough. It is observing things for a long
    time that gives you greater maturity and a deeper
    understanding.</p>

    <p>I didn't think when I left Paris that I should ever find
    Monticelli and Delacroix so <i>true</i>. It is only now, after
    months and months, that I am beginning to realize that they
    didn't dream it all up. And next year I think you'll see the
    same subjects again, orchards, the harvest, but - with a
    different colouring, and above all, a change in treatment. And
    these changes and variations will go on.</p>

    <p>My feeling is that I must work at a leisurely pace. Indeed,
    what about practicing the old saying, One should study for ten
    years or so, and then produce a few figures? That is what
    Monticelli did, after all. Hundreds of his pictures should be
    considered as nothing more than studies. But still, figures
    like the woman in yellow, or the woman with the parasol, the
    little one you have, or the lovers that Reid had, those are
    complete figures and one can only admire the way they were
    drawn. For in them Monticelli achieves drawing as rich and
    magnificent as that of Daumier and Delacroix. Certainly, at the
    price Monticellis are fetching, it would be an excellent
    speculation to buy some. The day will come when his beautiful
    <i>drawn</i> figures will be considered very great art.</p>

    <p>As for the beauty of the women and their costume, I'm sure
    the town of Arles was infinitely more glorious in the past.
    Everything has a blighted, faded quality about it now. Still,
    if you look at it for a long time, the old charm
    re-emerges.</p>

    <p>And that is why I can see that I will lose absolutely
    nothing by staying where I am and contenting myself with
    watching things go by, like a spider in its web waiting for
    flies.</p>

    <p>I can't force things, and now that I'm settled in, I'll be
    able to profit from all the fine days and all the opportunities
    for catching a real picture now and then.</p>

    <p>Milliet is lucky, he has as many Arl&eacute;siennes as he
    wants, but then, he can't paint them, and if he were a painter,
    he wouldn't have them. I shall just have to bide my time
    without rushing things.</p>

    <p>I've read another article on Wagner - Love in Music - I
    think by the same author who wrote the book on Wagner. How we
    need the same thing in painting!</p>

    <p>It seems that in the book, My Religion, Tolstoy implies that
    whatever happens in a violent revolution, there will also be an
    inner and hidden revolution in the people, out of which a new
    religion will be born, or rather, something completely new
    which will be nameless, but which will have the same effect of
    consoling, of making life possible, as the Christian religion
    used to.</p>

    <p>The book must be a very interesting one, it seems to me. In
    the end, we shall have had enough of cynicism, scepticism and
    humbug, and will want to live - more musically. How will this
    come about, and what will we discover? It would be nice to be
    able to prophesy, but it is even better to be forewarned,
    instead of seeing absolutely nothing in the future other than
    the disasters that are bound to strike the modern world and
    civilization like so many thunderbolts, through revolution, or
    war, or the bankruptcy of worm-eaten states.</p>

    <p>If we study Japanese art, we discover a man who is
    undeniably wise, philosophical and intelligent, who spends his
    time - doing what? Studying the distance from the earth and the
    moon? No! Studying the politics of Bismarck? No! He studies
    &hellip; a single blade of grass. But this blade of grass leads
    him to draw all the plants - then the seasons, the grand
    spectacle of landscapes, finally animals, then the human
    figure. That is how he spends his life, and life is too short
    to do everything.</p>

    <p>So come, isn't what we are taught by these simple Japanese,
    who live in nature as if they themselves were flowers, almost a
    true religion?</p>

    <p>And one cannot study Japanese art, it seems to me, without
    becoming merrier and happier, and we should turn back to nature
    in spite of our education and our work in a conventional
    world.</p>

    <p>Isn't it sad that the Monticellis have never been reproduced
    in beautiful lithographs or vibrant etchings? I should love to
    see what artists would say if an engraver like the one who
    engraved Vel&aacute;squez's work made a fine etching of them.
    Be that as it may, I think it rather more our duty to try to
    admire and know things for ourselves than to teach them to
    others. But the two can go hand in hand.</p>

    <p>I envy the Japanese the extreme clarity of everything in
    their work. It is never dull and it never seems to be done in
    too much of a hurry. Their work is as simple as breathing, and
    they do a figure in a few sure strokes as if it were as easy as
    doing up your waistcoat.</p>

    <p>Oh, I still have to learn to do a figure in a few strokes.
    That will keep me busy all winter. Once I can do that, I shall
    be able to do people walking the boulevards, in the streets,
    and masses of new subjects. While I've been writing this letter
    to you, I've already drawn a dozen. I'm on the right track, but
    it's very complicated, as what I am trying to do in a few
    strokes is to provide the figure of a man, a woman, a child, a
    horse or a dog, with a head, a body, legs and arms that all fit
    together.</p>

    <p>For the moment, and with a hearty handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>One day Madame De Lareby Laroquette said to me, Monticelli,
    Monticelli, now he was a man who should have been at the head
    of a great studio in the South.</p>

    <p>I wrote to our sister the other day, and to you, you
    remember, that sometimes I felt I was continuing Monticelli's
    work here. Well, now you can see we are setting up that studio
    in question.</p>

    <p>What Gauguin will be doing, what I shall be doing as well,
    will be in keeping with Monticelli's fine work, and we shall
    try to prove to the good people that Monticelli did not die
    slumped across the caf&eacute; tables of the Cannebi&eacute;re,
    but that the little fellow is still alive.</p>

    <p>And the thing won't end with us, we shall merely start it
    off on a fairly solid basis.</p>
