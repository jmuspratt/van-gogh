  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you very much for your letter and the 100-fr. note
    enclosed. I think now that you are right in this idea of
    settling Bing's bill, and for this reason I am sending you back
    50 francs, But I think it would be a mistake &ldquo;to have
    done&rdquo; with Bing - ah no, on the contrary, I should not be
    surprised if Gauguin, like myself, wants to have some of those
    Japanese prints here. So do just as you think best about paying
    him the 90 francs of the deposit in full, and then take up a
    full 100 francs' worth later on. Or else Bing will only replace
    the stuff represented by the 50 francs enclosed.</p>

    <p>If it were possible, seeing that the prints we have at our
    place are all beautiful, it would be better to take the whole
    stock. We get them so cheap, and can give pleasure to so many
    artists with them that altogether we must keep what favour we
    have with old Bing. I myself went to his place three times on
    New Year's Day to settle up, but probably because of the
    stock-taking, I found it shut up. Then a month later, before I
    left, I hadn't the money any more and I had also given a fair
    number of Japanese things to Bernard, when I exchanged with
    him.</p>

    <p>Only, be sure to take the 300 Hokusai views of the holy
    mountain, as well as the pictures of Japanese life.</p>

    <p>There is an attic in Bing's house with thousands of prints
    piled up, landscape and figures, and old prints too. He will
    let you choose for yourself some Sunday, so take plenty of old
    prints as well. He'll take some of them out when he goes
    through them, but he'll leave you many others.</p>

    <p>As far as I could see, that manager is a very nice fellow,
    and decent to anybody who is genuinely interested in
    things.</p>

    <p>I myself cannot understand why you do not keep the lovely
    Japanese things at the Boulevard Montmartre. He would give you
    some of the best on commission, I am sure.</p>

    <p>However, that's none of my business anyhow, but I am keen on
    our own private stock. All the same, stress the point that we
    make <i>nothing</i> on it: that we take a good deal of trouble
    about it, and finally that we have sometimes been the means of
    sending people to him.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">When I was in Paris, I always wanted to have a showroom of
    my own at a caf&eacute;, you know how that fell through.</p>

    <p>The exhibition of prints that I had at the Tambourin
    influenced Anquetin and Bernard a good deal, but what a
    disaster that was!</p>

    <p>As for the trouble we took over the second exhibition in the
    room on Boulevard de Clichy, I regret it even less: Bernard
    sold his first picture there, and Anquetin sold a study, and I
    made an exchange with Gauguin; we all got something out of it.
    If Gauguin likes, we could have an exhibition at Marseilles
    just like it. But we can't count on the Marseilles crowd any
    more than on Paris.</label></p>

    <p>But please keep the Bing stock, it is too much of an
    advantage. I have rather lost than gained on it as far as money
    goes, but for all that, it gave me a chance to look at a lot of
    Japanese stuff long and composedly. Your rooms would not be
    what they are without the Japanese things always there.</p>

    <p>Now the prints cost us 3 sous each, so for 100 francs, if we
    pay the 90 francs, we shall have a new stock of 650 prints,
    over and above whatever is left, or half that for the francs
    enclosed.</p>

    <p>I did not count on a 100 note this month after having
    received 50's, thinking that you were up against the Gauguin
    business and our sister's visit. So I will manage on that this
    month.</p>

    <p>I am working on some drawings for Russell to get him to send
    me some of his. I would willingly take Tanguy's flowers in
    exchange for another study if he despairs of the flowers. It
    just happens that we have hardly any more of these flowers, but
    his bill is as absurd as a bill which I might draw up as
    follows:</p>

    <p>Portrait of Tanguy 50</p>

    <p>Portrait of Mme. Tanguy 50</p>

    <p>Portrait of Mme. Tanguy's friend 50</p>

    <p>Money Tanguy has made on paints 50</p>

    <p>Friendship, etc. <i>50</i></p>

    <p>Total fr. 250</p>

    <p>Settling this bill is not urgent. All the same, I should be
    obliged to have something on account. But that's enough.</p>

    <p>A handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>By the way, about this book of Cassagne's, the difficulty of
    finding the publisher, if there is any, will be over if I tell
    you that the A B C D of Drawing by A. Cassagne is the
    <i>text</i> (sold separately, at 5 francs, I think) of
    Cassagne's Drawing for All, the 100 sections of which you
    surely know. It has just occurred to me that the book has the
    same publisher as the sections.</p>

    <p>I have sent off a roll of drawings. If you went to see
    Thomas with these and added the (four, I think) other drawings
    of the same size, we might pick up a few pennies from Daddy
    Thomas, if you explained to him the rather exceptional reason
    we have at the moment for wanting to do a little business. Then
    again, Thomas might buy something from Gauguin if he knows of
    the combination we have planned.</p>

    <p>If you pay the first deposit in full, why shouldn't we ask
    200 franc's commission instead of less?</p>

    <p>But on no account cancel the deposit. In a way all my work
    is founded on Japanese art, and if I have held my tongue about
    Bing, it is because I think that after my visit to the South, I
    may be able to take up the business more seriously.</p>

    <p>Japanese art, decadent in its own country, takes root again
    among the French impressionist artists. It is its practical
    value for artists that naturally interests me more than the
    trade in Japanese things. All the same the trade is
    interesting, all the more so because of the direction French
    art tends to take.</p>

    <p>Drop me a line to say if the drawings have reached you in
    good condition.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
