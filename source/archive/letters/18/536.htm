  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Enclosed is a letter from Gauguin, which arrived at the same
    moment as the letter from Bernard. It is just a cry of
    distress. &ldquo;I am getting deeper into debt every
    day.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I won't enlarge upon what he ought to do. You offer him
    hospitality here and accept the only means of payment that he
    has - his pictures. But if over and above that he demands that
    you pay his journey, he is going a bit too far, and at least he
    ought to make you an ample offer of pictures, and address
    himself to you as well as me in terms less vague than,
    &ldquo;Every day I go deeper into debt, and the journey becomes
    more and more out of the question.&rdquo; It would be more to
    the point if he said - &ldquo;I would rather leave my pictures
    in your hands since you are kind to me, and incur debts with
    you who are my friend, than live with my landlord.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But his stomach is all wrong, and when one has stomach-ache
    and indigestion, one has no will power.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">Now I myself have nothing wrong with my stomach at the
    moment, consequently my brain is freer and, I hope, clearer.</label> I
    think it is absolutely unfair that you who have just sent money
    - which you yourself had to borrow - for the furnishing of the
    house, should also have to bear the expense of the journey,
    especially when the journey is complicated by the payment of a
    debt.<label content="business.co-op"> Unless Gauguin pooled everything and let you have all his
    work, so that we'd keep no accounts but make common cause
    together. If we had a common purse and make common cause, I
    think myself that after a few years' working in common we
    should all profit.</label></p>

    <p>Because if the combination were arranged this way, you
    yourself would feel, I do not say happier, but a better artist,
    and more productive than with me alone.</p>

    <p>Both he and I will feel strongly that we must succeed
    because the honour of all three of us is at stake, and that
    each is not working for himself alone. That's how it looks to
    me. And I believe that even if collapse is in the nature of
    things and bound to come, we must still act in the same way.
    But more and more I reject the idea of this collapse, when I
    think of the serenity you see on the faces in the Frans Halses
    and the Rembrandts, such as the portrait of old Six, or his
    self-portrait, or those Frans Halses in Haarlem that we know so
    well: pictures of old men and women.</p>

    <p>It is better to have serenity than to be too timorous.</p>

    <p>Why then such a noise about this Gauguin business? He will
    do well to come to us, and we would like him to come.</p>

    <p>But neither he nor we are to let ourselves be crushed.</p>

    <p>On the whole there was a fine calm about that letter of his,
    although he left his intentions where we are concerned in the
    air.</p>

    <p>Only if this thing is really to come off, we must have
    loyalty on his part.</p>

    <p>I am rather curious to know what he will say to you himself.
    I reply to him exactly as I feel, but I do not want to say
    depressing or dismal or malicious things to so great an artist.
    But from the money point of view the business is taking on
    serious proportions - there is the journey, there is the debt,
    and there is also the furnishing, which is not yet
    complete.</p>

    <p>However, it is already complete enough so that if Gauguin
    turned up here unexpectedly, we should be able to manage until
    we had time to turn around. Gauguin is married, and we must
    thoroughly realize in advance that in the long run it is not
    certain that our various interests will be compatible.</p>

    <p>That is why in any case of association, the conditions must
    be very clearly stated, so as not to quarrel afterward.</p>

    <p>If all goes well with Gauguin, you can see at this point
    that he will make it up with his wife and children. Certainly I
    should wish that for him. Well then, we must have more faith in
    the value of his pictures that his landlord has, but he must
    not overestimate them so much to you that you get only the
    burden and expense of the association, instead of some profit.
    That must not be, and anyhow will not be. But you should have
    his best work from him.</p>

    <p>I ought to warn you that I intend to keep several studies at
    the studio here instead of sending them to you. I think that if
    I carry on steadily with this plan of making the house here
    something really artistic, you will have a series of studies
    later on which will have a lasting value.</p>

    <p>By the way, Russell has replied in the negative about buying
    a Gauguin, but he asks me to go and stay with him for a while,
    but first and last are the travelling expenses. I do not say
    however that he will not buy a Gauguin, for he will realize
    himself that he isn't being very benevolent just now. But after
    all in building a house, provided that he puts people up in it,
    he is doing a very necessary work, against the time when our
    landlords kick us out.</p>

    <p>Good-by for now and a good handshake!</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
