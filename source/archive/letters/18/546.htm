    <p>Letter 546<br>
     Arles<br>
     8 October 1888 (unfinished - not sent)</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">Thanks for your letter, but I have had a very
    thin time of it these days, as my money ran out on Thursday, so it was a
    damnably long time till Monday noon. These four days I have
    lived mainly on 23 cups of coffee, with bread which I still
    have to pay for. </label>It's not your fault, it's mine if it's
    anyone's. Because I was wild to see my pictures in frames, and
    I had ordered too many for my budget, seeing that the month's
    rent and the charwoman also had to be paid. And even today is
    going to drain me dry, <label content="art.support">because I must also buy some canvas and
    prepare it myself, as Tasset's has not yet come. Would you ask
    him as soon as possible if he has sent it off, 10 meters or at
    least 5 of ordinary canvas at 2.50 fr.</label></p>

    <p>But I should not mind, my dear boy, if I did not feel that
    you yourself must suffer from the pressure that this work puts
    on us now. But I venture to think that if you saw the studies,
    you would say I was right to work at white heat as long as it
    was fine. It wasn't so the last few days, there is a merciless
    mistral furiously sweeping along the dead leaves. But between
    now and the winter there will be another spell of magnificent
    weather and magnificent effects, and then the thing will be to
    make another headlong spurt. I am so much taken up with the
    work that I cannot come to a dead stop. Don't worry, the bad
    weather will make me stop only too soon, like today, yesterday
    and the day before yesterday too.</p>

    <p>Do your utmost to persuade Thomas. He is bound to do
    something. <label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">Do you know what I have left today for the week, and
    that after four days of strict fasting? Just 6 francs. It is
    Monday, the very day I received your letter. I ate something at
    noon, but already this evening I shall have to sup on a crust
    of bread. And the money is spent on nothing but the house, or
    else the pictures.</label></p>

    <p>This is great news about Bague.</p>

    <p>If these good gentlemen can make use of the Mauves as a
    set-off for Corot, it may come off and it may be a true and
    even a just thing. Because really, the Mauves, Mesdags or
    Marises have a heavy effect beside Corot. It is none the less
    true that they have bought a lot of it, even Mauve's last
    watercolours. It was they who took them to be framed at that
    place where we saw them, the man who made the frames for Reid's
    Monticellis. I am almost sure that Bague will like my big
    studies, <art id=0474>the &ldquo;Starry Sky,&rdquo;</art> <art id=0574>&ldquo;Furrows,&rdquo;</art>
    etc., he will like some in the last batch much less. So far
    Bague is in sympathy with me because he likes painting to be
    rich and in full impasto. I have heard him on it often enough
    in the past. I do not count at all on their buying, only it
    would do no harm to tell Bague that I have some big studies
    here - new ones - of autumn effects. And keep him going with
    that. I should say you might show him and Thomas <art id=0403>the white
    orchard</art>, <art id=0412>&ldquo;The Harvest&rdquo; (size 30 canvas)</art>, but not
    much else. <label content="art.technique">We must not push the studies, which are more trouble
    to do but are less pleasing to the eye than the pictures, which
    are the result and fruit of them, and which one paints as in a
    dream, without so much agony.</label></p>

    <p>I have had walnut frames made for the <art id=0468>two pictures</art> of
    <art id=1465>&ldquo;The Poet's Garden,&rdquo;</art> and they have a very good
    effect. And now I am looking for a frame in yellowish chestnut.
    It is as stiff and plain as the rim of a slate, but the tone of
    the wood does well. Pine also goes well with the
    &ldquo;Furrows&rdquo; and the <art id=0475>&ldquo;Vineyard.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>If you were very kind and would send me a louis by return
    mail, I could get through the week and be spared the
    &ldquo;pinching&rdquo; which accompanied the beginning of this
    month. Without it I should get too run down, and I should not
    have all my strength for the fine days which I hope we shall
    have at the end of the week after the mistral.</p>

    <p>Herewith another letter that I wrote about <art id=auguinsp>Gauguin's
    portrait</art> during the last few days. I am sending it to you
    because I have no time to copy it out, but the chief thing is
    that I underline this, That I do not like these atrocious
    hardships of &ldquo;the craft,&rdquo; except in so far as they
    show us the way. Our way is neither to endure them ourselves
    nor to make others endure them, but the opposite.</p>

    <p>I do not think I exaggerate about Gauguin's portrait, nor
    about Gauguin himself.</p>

    <p>He must eat and go for walks with me in lovely surroundings,
    pick up a nice girl now and then, see the house as it is and as
    we shall make it, and altogether enjoy himself.</p>

    <p>He has lived cheaply, yes, but he has got so ill by doing it
    that he can see no difference between a gay colour and a dismal
    one.</p>

    <p>Well, that gets one nowhere.</p>

    <p>It is high time that he came, no fear that he will recover
    very soon. Meantime forgive me too if I exceed my allowance; I
    shall work all the more. I promise you. But I have an absolute
    horror of this melancholy &agrave; la M&eacute;ryon.</p>

    <p>You will see the two portraits of Gauguin and <art id=ernardsp>Bernard</art>
    someday, and compare them with the <art id=egresses>&ldquo;Negresses.&rdquo;</art> And
    you will see that he absolutely must cheer up.</p>

    <p>Or else . . .</p>

    <p>But none of that &ldquo;or else,&rdquo; we'll take it for
    granted that he is going to cheer up.</p>

    <p>But it is indeed high time.</p>

    <p>I write in haste, I am working on a portrait.</p>

    <p>That is to say, I am doing <art id=0477>a portrait of Mother</art> for myself.
    I cannot stand the colourless photograph, and I am trying to do
    one in a harmony of colour, as I see her in my memory.</p>

    <p>A good handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Do not delay, if it does not leave you too short, do not
    delay sending me the <i>louis</i> and the canvas.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.diet">I have been so hard up since <i>Thursday</i> that from
    Thursday to <i>Monday</i> I only had two meals; apart from
    those I had only bread and coffee and even that I had to drink
    on credit, and had to pay for today. So if you can, do not
    delay a minute.</label></p>
