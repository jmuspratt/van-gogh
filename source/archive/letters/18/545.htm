  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter. How glad I am for Gauguin; I
    shall not try to find words to tell you - let's be of good
    heart.</p>

    <p>I have just received <art id=auguinsp>the portrait of Gauguin by himself</art> and
    the <art id=ernardsp>portrait of Bernard by Bernard</art> and in the background of the
    portrait of Gauguin there is Bernard's on the wall, and vice
    versa.</p>

    <p>The Gauguin is of course remarkable, but I very much like
    Bernard's picture. It is just the inner vision of a painter, a
    few abrupt tones, a few dark lines, but it has the distinction
    of a real, real Manet.</p>

    <p>The Gauguin is more studied, carried further. That, along
    with what he says in his letter, gave me absolutely the
    impression of its representing a prisoner. Not a shadow of
    gaiety. Absolutely nothing of the flesh, but one can
    confidently put that down to his determination to make a
    melancholy effect, the flesh in the shadows has gone a dismal
    blue.</p>

    <p>So now at last I have a chance to compare my painting with
    what the comrades are doing. <art id=0476>My portrait</art>, which I am sending to
    Gauguin in exchange, holds its own, I am sure
    of that. I have written to Gauguin in reply to his letter that
    if I might be allowed to stress my own personality in a
    portrait, I had done so in trying to convey in my portrait not
    only myself but an impressionist in general, had conceived it
    as the portrait of a bonze, a simple worshiper of the eternal
    Buddha.</p>

    <p>And when I put Gauguin's conception and my own side by side,
    mine is as grave, but less despairing. What Gauguin's portrait
    says to me before all things is that he must not go on like
    this, he must become again the richer Gauguin of the
    &ldquo;Negresses.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I am very glad to have these two portraits, for they finally
    represent the comrades at this stage; they will not remain like
    that, they will come back to a more serene life.</p>

    <p>And I see clearly that the duty laid upon me is to do
    everything I can to lessen our poverty.</p>

    <p>No good comes the way in this painter's job. I feel that he
    is more Millet than I, but I am more Diaz then he, and like
    Diaz I am going to try to please the public, so that a few
    pennies may come into our community. I have spent more than
    they, but I do not care a bit now that I see their
    painting&mdash;they have worked in too much poverty to
    succeed.</p>

    <p>Mind you, I have better and more saleable stuff than what I
    have sent you, and I feel that I can go on doing it. I have
    confidence in it at last. I know that it will do some people's
    hearts good to find poetic subjects again,<art id=0474> &ldquo;The Starry
    Sky,&rdquo;</art> <art id=0475>&ldquo;The Vines in Leaf,&rdquo;</art>
    <art id=0574>&ldquo;The Furrows,&rdquo;</art>
    the <art id=0468>&ldquo;Poet's Garden.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">So then I believe that it is your duty and mine to demand
    comparative wealth just because we have very great artists to
    keep alive. But at the moment you are as fortunate, or at least
    fortunate in the same way, as Sensier if you have Gauguin and I
    hope he will be with us heart and soul. There is no hurry, but
    in any case I think that he will like the house so much as a
    studio that he will agree to being its head. Give us half a
    year and see what that will mean.</label></p>

    <p>Bernard has again sent me a collection of ten drawings with
    a daring poem - the whole is called At the Brothel.</p>

    <p>You will soon see these things, but I shall send you the
    portraits when I have had them to look at for some time.</p>

    <p>I hope you will write soon, I am very hard up because of the
    stretchers and frames that I ordered.</p>

    <p>What you told me of Freret gave me pleasure, but I venture
    to think that I shall do things which will please him better,
    and you too.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I painted a sunset.</p>

    <p>Gauguin looks ill and tormented in his portrait!! You wait,
    that will not last, and it will be very interesting to compare
    this portrait with the one he will do of himself in six months'
    time.</p>

    <p>Someday you will also see my self-portrait, which I am
    sending to Gauguin, because he will keep it, I hope.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">It is all ashen gray against pale veronese (no yellow). The
    clothes are this brown coat with a blue border, but I have
    exaggerated the brown into purple, and the width of the blue
    borders.</p>

    <p>The head is modeled in light colours painted in a thick
    impasto against the light background with hardly any shadows.
    Only I have made the eyes <i>slightly</i> slanting like the
    Japanese.</label></p>

    <p>Write me soon and the best of luck. How happy old Gauguin
    will be.</p>

    <p>A good handshake, and thank Freret for the pleasure he has
    given me. Good-by for now.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent.</p>
