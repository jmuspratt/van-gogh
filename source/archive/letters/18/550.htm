  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thinking and thinking these days how all these expenses of
    painting are weighing on you, you cannot imagine how disquieted
    I am. When things happen to us like what you told me in your
    last letter about Bague, we must be getting very near to
    selling.</p>

    <p>Or rather we ought to be getting near to finding some
    assistance, either from Thomas or some other of the half
    dealer, half collector type.<label content="business.sales"> C. M., without helping us in any
    other way, could buy one study from us once again.</label></p>

    <p>I do not know if you have ever read Les Fr&egrave;res
    Zemganno by the de Goncourt brothers, which perhaps roughly
    sketches their life story. If you know it, you will know that I
    am more afraid than I can say lest the effort to get money
    exhaust you too much.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">If I were not so horribly and continually tormented by this
    uneasiness, I should say that we were getting on, because my
    work will get better, and my health is much better than in
    Paris.</p>

    <p>I see more and more that my work goes infinitely better when
    I am properly fed, and the paints are there, and the studio and
    all that.</label></p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">But have I set my heart on my work being a success? A
    thousand times <i>no</i>. I wish I could manage to make you
    really understand that when you give money to artists, you are
    yourself doing an artist's work, and that I only want my
    pictures to be of such a quality that you will not be too
    dissatisfied with <i>your</i> work.</label> And that is not all, I
    should also like you to feel that you are making a profit on
    the money you invest, and that by doing so, we shall achieve a
    more complete independence than we should gain in the art trade
    itself.</p>

    <p>And what will be done later to reform trade may be just
    this, that the dealer will join hands with the artist, the one
    for what one may call the housekeeping side, to provide the
    studio, food, paint, etc., the other to create. Alas! We have
    not got to that with the old trade, which will always follow
    the old routine, and is no good to anyone alive, nor any profit
    to the dead either.</p>

    <p>But there, we need not stew about it, because it is not our
    duty to alter what exists, and to beat our heads against a
    stone wall.</p>

    <p>Anyway, we must get our place in the sun without upsetting
    anyone. And I keep thinking that you haven't the place in the
    sun that you ought to have, because the Paris work at Goupil's
    is too exhausting. Then, when I think of that, I get into a
    mercenary frenzy. Then I want to earn money so that you will be
    freer to go where you like and do what you like. I feel that we
    are getting near to selling or finding help, so that we shall
    be given a chance to breathe.</p>

    <p>There I go, perhaps, thinking that it is quite near, and it
    may still be far off, and then I feel this dread of spending
    too much coming over me. However, the pictures come off better
    if one looks after oneself and keeps one's health.</p>

    <p>But as for you and your work, and in the rest of your life
    as well, you must not have too many anxieties.<label content="Theo.health"> How are those
    sciatica pains, have they stopped? </label>In any case, you will help
    me more by staying well and living well than by being too
    straitened on my account, even if the consignment of paints has
    to suffer.</p>

    <p>I think the time will come when my work will be in demand,
    very good, but it still may be far off, and meanwhile do not
    pinch yourself. Because business, as well as painting, will
    come of itself and in a dream, as it were, quicker and better
    if you are taking care of yourself than if you are stinting.
    And at our age, surely, we ought to have a certain calm, a
    certain wisdom in managing our affairs. I am afraid now of
    poverty, bad health and all that, and hope that you share these
    feelings.</p>

    <p>So I almost feel remorse at having bought that piece of
    furniture today, although it is good, because I have had to ask
    you to send me money sooner than I should have otherwise.</p>

    <p>Get this quite clear, if you are ill or if you have too many
    difficulties or worries, nothing will go well. And if you are
    well, business will end by coming to you of itself, and ideas
    about your business will come to you infinitely more abundantly
    if you are eating well than if you are not eating enough.</p>

    <p>So say stop if I am going too fast. If not, of course so
    much the better, because I also can certainly work much better
    when I am comfortable than when I am too hard up. But don't go
    and think that I care more for my work than for our well-being,
    or at least than for our peace of mind above all. Gauguin will
    feel the same thing someday and he will get all right
    again.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the time will really come for him when he will want
    to be - and will be able to become again - what he really is -
    the father of a family.</p>

    <p>I am very, very curious to know what he has done in
    Brittany. Bernard wrote praising it greatly. But it is so
    difficult to paint richly in cold and poverty, and perhaps his
    real home will prove to be the warmer, happier South after
    all.</p>

    <p>If you saw the vines! There are bunches that actually weigh
    a <i>kilogram</i>. The grapes are magnificent this year because
    of the fine autumn days that came at the end of a summer that
    had left a lot to be desired.</p>

    <p>I am sorry I spent money on that chest of drawers, but
    perhaps it will save us buying a more expensive one; the
    cheapest would have been 35 francs. And when Gauguin comes, he
    must have something to put his linen in, and altogether his
    room will be more complete with it.</p>

    <p>If ever for a moment we are rather flush, I shall take this
    one for myself, and get him the one for 35 Frs. You can
    <i>always</i> find a bargain at that price, but <i>not</i>
    always at the price I paid for this one.</p>

    <p>I have been thinking that if you've got some studies of mine
    that are beginning to crowd your place a bit and get in your
    way, you could take them off the stretchers and send them down
    here where there's room enough to store them. I am thinking of
    some of last year's stuff, or for that matter anything that is
    inconveniencing you.</p>

    <p>Paris will be very beautiful in autumn all the same. The
    town here is <i>nothing</i>, at night everything is
    <i>black</i>. I think that plenty of gas, which is after all
    yellow and orange, heightens the blue, because at night the sky
    here looks to me - and it's very odd - <i>blacker</i> than in
    Paris. And if I ever see Paris again, I shall try to paint some
    of the effects of gaslight on the boulevard.</p>

    <p>Ah, but in Marseilles it will be the opposite, I imagine
    that it must be more beautiful than Paris, the
    Cannebi&egrave;re.</p>

    <p>I so often think of Monticelli, and when my mind dwells on
    the stories going around about his death, it seems to me that
    not only must you exclude the idea of his dying a drunkard in
    the sense of being besotted by drink, but you must also realise
    that here as a matter of course one spends one's life in the
    open air and in caf&eacute;s far more than in the North. My
    friend the postman, for instance, lives a great deal in
    caf&eacute;s, and is certainly more or less of a drinker, and
    has been so all his life. But he is so much the reverse of a
    sot, his exaltation is so natural, so intelligent, and he
    argues with such sweep, in the style of Garibaldi, that I
    gladly reduce the legend of Monticelli the drunkard on absinthe
    to exactly the same proportions as my postman's.</p>

    <p>My paper is full, write me as soon as you can. With a
    handshake and good luck,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Someday perhaps I shall know some details of those last days
    of Monticelli.</p>

    <p>I notice that this chest has panels exactly like those on
    which Monticelli painted.</p>
