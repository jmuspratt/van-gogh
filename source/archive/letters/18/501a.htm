    <p>[Letter presented here in Vincent's unaltered English.]</p>

    <p>My dear Russell,</p>

    <p>For ever so long I have wanted to write you - but then the
    work has so taken me up. We have harvest time here at present
    and I am always in the fields.</p>

    <p>And when I sit down to write I am so abstracted by
    recollections of what I have seen that I leave the letter. For
    instance at the present occasion I was writing to you, and
    going to say something about Arles as it is - and as it was in
    the old days of Boccaccio.</p>

    <p>Well, instead of continuing the letter I began to draw on
    the very paper the head of the dirty little girl I saw this
    afternoon whilst I was painting <art id=0426>a view of the river with a
    greenish yellow sky</art>.</p>

    <p><?showImage("607_V-J_501a0");?>
    </p>

    <p>The dirty &ldquo;mudlark&rdquo; I thought yet had a vague
    Florentine sort of figure like the heads in the Monticelli
    pictures, and reasoning and drawing this wise I worked on the
    letter I was writing to you. I enclose the slip of scribbling
    that you may judge of my abstractions, and forgive my not
    writing before as such. Do not however imagine I am painting
    old Florentine scenery - no, I may dream of such - but I spend
    my time in painting and drawing landscapes or rather studies of
    colour.</p>

    <p>The actual inhabitants of this country often remind me of
    the figures we see in Zola's work.</p>

    <p>And Manet would like them as they are, and the city as it
    is. Bernard is still in Brittany and I believe he is working
    hard and doing well.</p>

    <p>Gauguin is in Brittany too, but has again suffered of an
    attack of his liver complaint. I wished I were in the same
    place with him, or he were here with me.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">My brother has an exhibition of 10 new pictures by Claude
    Monet - his latest works, for instance a landscape with red
    sunset and a group of dark fir trees by the seaside. The red
    sun casts an orange or blood red reflection on the blue green
    trees and the ground. I wished I could see them.</label></p>

    <p>How is your house in Brittany getting on - and have you been
    working in the country?</p>

    <p>I believe my brother has also another picture by Gauguin
    which is as I heard say very fine,<art id=egresses> two negro women talking, it
    is one of those he did at Martinique</art>. McKnight told me he had
    seen at Marseilles a picture by Monticelli, flowerpiece.</p>

    <p>Very soon I intend sending over some studies to Paris and
    then you can, if you like, choose one for our exchange.</p>

    <p>I must hurry off this letter for I feel some more
    abstractions coming on and if I did not quickly fill up my
    paper I would again set to drawing and you would not have your
    letter.</p>

    <p>I heard Rodin has a beautiful head at the salon.</p>

    <p>I have been to the seaside for a week and very likely am
    going thither again soon. Flat shore sands - fine figures there
    like Cimabue - straight stylish.</p>

    <p><art id=0422>Am working at a sower</art>:</p>

    <p><?showImage("607_V-J_501a1");?>
    </p>

    <p>the great field all violet the sky &amp; sun very yellow, it
    is a hard subject to treat.</p>

    <p>Please remember me very kindly to Mrs. Russell - and in
    thought I heartily shake hands.</p>

    <p>Yours very truly, Vincent</p>
