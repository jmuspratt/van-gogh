    <p>Arles, 31 July 1888</p>

    <p>Dear Sister,</p>

    <p>I will answer your letter of this morning without delay.</p>

    <p>I shall probably hear from Paris by tomorrow what Theo is
    going to do, whether he will be able to get away. I don't doubt
    that he will go to you if he can. It is not always admirable
    for a person one knows to set out on the great journey to that
    other hemisphere of life whose existence we only surmise. But
    it goes without saying that my best wishes are with today's
    traveler.</p>

    <p>I am working very hard now, and I think the summer here
    extremely beautiful, more beautiful than I ever saw it in the
    North, but people here are complaining loudly that it is not
    the same as usual. Now and then some rain in the morning or the
    afternoon, but infinitely less than in our country. The harvest
    was gathered long ago. <label content="art.technique">There is much wind here, however, a very
    ill-natured, whining wind - le mistral - very troublesome for
    the most part, when I have to paint in it, in which case I put
    my canvas down flat on the ground, and work on my knees. For
    the easel does not stand firm.</label></p>

    <p><art id=0429>I have a study of a garden one meter wide, poppies and other
    red flowers surrounded by green in the foreground, and a square
    of bluebells. Then a bed of orange and yellow Africans, then
    white and yellow flowers, and at last, in the background, pink
    and lilac, and also dark violet scabriosas, and red geraniums,
    and sunflowers, and a fig tree and an oleander and a vine. And
    in the distance black cypresses against low white houses with
    orange roofs - and a delicate green-blue streak of sky</art>.</p>

    <p>Oh, I know very well that not a single flower is drawn
    completely, that they are more dabs of colour, red, yellow,
    orange, green blue, violet, but the impression of all these
    colours in their juxtaposition is there all right, in the
    painting as in nature. But I suppose you would be disappointed,
    and think it unbeautiful, if you saw it. But you see that the
    subject is rather summery.</p>

    <p>Uncle Cor has seen work of mine more than once, and he
    thinks it execrable.</p>

    <p>I am now engaged on <art id=0433>a portrait of a postman in his dark-blue
    uniform with yellow. A head somewhat like Socrates, hardly any
    nose at all, a high forehead, bald crown, little grey eyes,
    bright red chubby cheeks, a big pepper-and-salt beard, large
    ears</art>. The man is an ardent republican and
    socialist, reasons quite well, and knows a lot of things. His
    wife was delivered of a child today, and he is consequently
    feeling as proud as a peacock, and is all aglow with
    satisfaction.</p>

    <p>In point of fact I greatly prefer painting a thing like this
    to doing pictures of flowers.</p>

    <p>But since this can be done without ignoring the other, I am
    taking advantage of the opportunities as they come</p>

    <p>I also have <art id=0431>a portrait of a twelve-year-old girl, brown
    eyes, black hair and eyebrows, yellowish matte complexion. She
    is sitting in a cane chair, a blood-red-and-violet-striped
    bodice, a deep blue skirt with little orange dots, a branch of
    oleander in her hand. The background light green, nearly white</art>.</p>

    <p>I am always looking for the same thing - a portrait; a
    landscape; a landscape and a portrait.</p>

    <p>I shall also get to paint the baby born today, at least I
    hope so. I have also got <art id=0428>a garden without flowers, that is to
    say a lawn, newly mown, bright green with the grey hay spread
    in long streaks. A weeping ash and a number of cedars and
    cypresses, the cedars yellowish and spherical in form, the
    cypresses rising high into the air, blue-green. At the back
    oleander and a patch of green blue sky. The blue shadows of the
    shrubs on the grass</art>.</p>

    <p>Also <art id=0423>a portrait bust of a Zouave, in a blue uniform with red
    and yellow trimmings, with a sky-blue sash, a blood-red cap
    with a blue tassel, and face sunburned - black hair cropped
    short - eyes leering like a cat's - orange and green - a small
    head on a bull's neck. In this one the background is a harshly
    green door and some orange bricks of the wall and the white stucco</art>.</p>

    <p>Now as regards what you ask, as to whether it is hot here,
    and whether I am going to live with somebody else. Well, this
    rather probably, and with a very clever painter too who, like
    the other impressionists, is leading a life full of cares, and
    who is the proud owner of a liver complaint besides. Some time
    ago Theo bought a large picture from him portraying <art id=egresses>Negresses
    in pink, blue, orange and yellow cotton dresses under tamarind,
    coconut and banana trees with the sea in the distance.</art> Like Le
    mariage de Loti, that description of Otaheite. The fact is that
    he has been in Martinique, and has painted amid the tropical
    scenery there. We have a second painting of his besides, which
    he exchanged for one of my studies, <art id=artinique>a dried river with violet
    mud and pools of water, mirroring the pure cobalt blue of the
    sky, green grass, a Negro boy with a red-and-white cow, a
    Negress in blue, and a patch of green forest.</art> He is a fellow
    who works like one possessed and he does all sorts of things;
    he is in Brittany at the moment.</p>

    <p>We shall probably go live together for the sake of economy,
    and to give each other company. He will come here if he or I
    can sell something one of these days so that he can pay for his
    journey. It is not impossible that some obstacle will crop up,
    but on the whole it is quite probable that it will happen. And
    even if it should not happen and I had to go on working alone,
    yet working in the same direction as the other fellows,
    although every one of them maintains his own style, brings
    about something of a comradeship, and at times leads to an
    interesting correspondence.</p>

    <p>How is your health? Good, I hope. Above all you should try
    to get into the country as much as possible.<label content="health.gastrointestinal"> Here I am
    afflicted now and then with an inability to eat, something of
    the sort you suffered from at the time.</label> But on the whole I
    manage to steer clear of the rocks. When your body forsakes
    you, use your brains - you and I with our constitutions should
    take this to heart. For that matter work, if we are making
    headway, can help a lot.</p>

    <p>I think it exquisitely beautiful here in summer; the green
    is very deep and rich; the air is thin and astonishingly clear.
    But for all that the wide plain might often remind me very
    strongly of the Dutch scenery - here where there are hardly any
    mountains or rocks - if the colour were not so different. But
    what pleases me very much is the gaily coloured clothes, the
    women and girls dressed in cheap simple material, but with
    green, red and pink, Havana-yellow, violet or blue stripes, or
    dots of the same colours. White scarves; red, green and yellow
    parasols. A vigorous sun, like sulphur, shining on it all, the
    great blue sky - sometimes it is as enormously gay as Holland
    is gloomy.</p>

    <p>What a pity that not everybody has these two extremes.</p>

    <p>Now I must stop. Uncle's death is a big event for you and
    Mother, and particularly for our aunt. The impression it makes
    on me is very <i>strange</i>, because in my mind there is an
    image of the man made up of memories of so long ago, of a great
    many years ago, and I think it so peculiar that a man one once
    knew at such close range should have become <i>such</i> a
    stranger. I suppose you will be able to understand this. Looked
    at from this point of view, life is so much like a dream; and
    from the moment things are simplified again, and the sick man
    undertakes his great journey, one understands it better, and it
    is a certain fact that my feelings about it are similar to
    yours. Theo will feel it very much too; he has had much more
    intercourse with Uncle than I.</p>

    <p>How is Mother these days?</p>

    <p>I often think of you both, and it is from the bottom of my
    heart that I give you my best wishes.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I am up to my ears in work, and it happens so seldom that I
    have anything else in mind.</p>

    <p>My address is:</p>

    <p>2 Place Lamartine</p>

    <p>Arles.</p>

    <p>B.d.Rh.</p>

    <p>If you <i>can</i> manage it, don't lose sight of those books
    and prints of mine that I wrote you about.</p>
