  <body>
    <p>Letter W4<br>
     Arles, c. 22 June 1888</p>

    <p>Dear sister,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter, which I have been longing for.
    I dare not indulge my feelings to the extent of writing you
    often or of encouraging you to do the same.<label content="psychology.depression"> All this
    correspondence does not tend to keep us, who are of a nervous
    temperament, vigorous in case of possible immersions in
    melancholy of the type you mention in your letter, and to which
    I myself fall victim now and then.</label></p>

    <p>An acquaintance of ours used to assert that the best
    treatment for all diseases is to treat them with profound
    contempt.</p>

    <p>The remedy for the immersion which you mention is not, as
    far as I know, to be found growing among the herbs with healing
    powers.<label content="food-and-drink.preference"> Nevertheless, I am in the habit of taking large
    quantities of bad coffee in such cases, not because it is very
    good for my already damaged collection of teeth, but because my
    strong imaginative powers enable me to have a devout faith -
    worthy of an idolater or a Christian or a cannibal - in the
    exhilarating influence of said fluid. Fortunately for my fellow
    creatures I have until today refrained from recommending this
    and similar remedies as efficacious.</label></p>

    <p>The sun in these parts, <i>that</i> is something different,
    and also if over a period of time one drinks wine, which - at
    least partly - is pressed from real grapes. I assure you that
    in our native country people are as blind as bats and
    criminally stupid because they do not exert themselves to go
    more to the Indies or somewhere else where the sun shines. It
    is not right to know only one thing - one gets stultified by
    that; one should not rest before one knows the opposite
    too.</p>

    <p>What you say about extenuating circumstances, namely that,
    alas, they do not obviate the fact of one's having done
    something wrong or of having spoiled something is very true.
    Only think of our national history, the <i>Rise and fall of the
    Dutch Republic</i>, and you will understand what I mean. We
    must never invoke the excuse of extenuating circumstances, of
    our inability, and so on. It is less Christian (in the sense in
    which it is diluted nowadays), but it is better for us, and
    perhaps even for others. And energy begets energy, and
    conversely paralysis paralyzes others.</p>

    <p>Here we are now, living in a world of painting which is
    unutterably paralytic and miserable. The exhibitions, the
    picture stores, everything, everything, are in the clutches of
    fellows who intercept all the money. And do not suppose for a
    moment that this is only my imagination. People give a lot of
    money for the work after a painter himself is dead. And they
    are always slighting the living painters, fatuously defending
    themselves by pointing to the work of those who are no longer
    there.</p>

    <p>I know we are unable to do anything to alter this. So for
    heaven's sake one must resign oneself to it, or try to find
    some sort of subvention, or conquer a rich woman, or something
    of the kind, or else one cannot work. All that one hopes for,
    independence through work, influence on others, all comes to
    nothing, nothing at all.</p>

    <p>And yet it is a certain pleasure to paint a picture, and yet
    at this very moment there are some twenty painters here, all
    having more debts than money, etc., all leading lives
    approximately comparable to the lives of street dogs, who are
    going to be of perhaps more importance than the whole of the
    official exhibition as far as the future style of painting is
    concerned.</p>

    <p>I should imagine that the most distinctive characteristic of
    the painter is being able to paint. Those who are able to
    paint, to paint the best, are the beginnings of something that
    will last a long time to come; they will go on existing as long
    as there are eyes capable of enjoying something that is
    specifically beautiful. But I always regret that one cannot
    make oneself richer by working harder - on the contrary -</p>

    <p>If only one could do that, one would be able to achieve a
    good deal more, get associated with others, and whatnot. For
    now everybody is chained to the opportunity he has of earning
    his bread, which means that in fact one is far from free.</p>

    <p>You ask whether I sent something to the &ldquo;Arti&rdquo;
    exhibition <sup>1</sup> - certainly not! Only Theo sent Mr.
    Tersteeg a consignment of pictures by impressionist painters
    and among them there was one of mine. But the only result has
    been that neither Tersteeg nor the artists, as Theo informed
    me, have seen anything in them.</p>

    <p>Well, this is extremely comprehensible, for it is invariably
    the same thing all over again. One has heard talk about the
    impressionists, one expects a whole lot from them,
    and&hellip;and when one sees them for the first time one is
    bitterly, bitterly disappointed and thinks them slovenly, ugly,
    badly painted, badly drawn, bad in colour, everything that's
    miserable.</p>

    <p>This was my own first impression too when I came to Paris,
    dominated as I was by the ideas of Mauve and Isra&euml;ls and
    other clever painters. And when there is an exhibition in Paris
    of impressionists only, it is my belief that a lot of visitors
    come back from it bitterly disappointed, and even indignant, in
    a state of mind comparable to the mood of the decent Dutchmen
    in the days of yore, who left church and a moment later heard a
    discourse by Domela Nieuwenhuis <sup>2</sup> or one of the
    other socialists.</p>

    <p>And yet - you know it - within ten or fifteen years the
    whole edifice of the national religion collapsed, and - the
    socialists are still there, and will be there for a long time
    to come, although neither you nor I are very much addicted to
    either creed.</p>

    <p>Well, Art - the officially recognized art - and its
    training, its management, its organization, are stagnant-minded
    and moldering, like the religion we see crashing, and it will
    not last, though there be ever so many exhibitions, studios,
    schools, etc. Will last as little as the bulb trade.</p>

    <p>But this is none of our business; we are neither the
    founders of something new, nor are we called on to be the
    preservers of something old.</p>

    <p>But this is what remains - a painter is a person who paints,
    in the same way that a florist is in reality a person who loves
    plants and grows them himself, which is not done by the flower
    merchant.</p>

    <p>And consequently, though some of those twenty painters or so
    who are called impressionists have become comparatively rich
    men, and rather big fellows in the world, yet the majority of
    them are poor devils, whose homes are cafes, who lodge in cheap
    inns and live from hand to mouth, from day to day.</p>

    <p>But in a <i>single day</i> those twenty whom I mentioned
    paint everything they lay eyes on, and better than many a big
    noise who has a high reputation in the art world.</p>

    <p>I tell you this in order to make you understand what kind of
    tie exists between me and the French painters who are called
    impressionists - that I know many of them personally, and that
    I like them.</p>

    <p>And that furthermore in my own technique I have the same
    ideas about colour, even thought about them when I was still in
    Holland.</p>

    <p>Cornflowers and white chrysanthemums and a certain number of
    marigolds - see here a motif in blue and orange.</p>

    <p>Heliotrope and yellow roses - motif in lilac and yellow.</p>

    <p>Poppies or red geraniums in vigorously green leaves - motif
    in red and green.</p>

    <p>These are fundamentals, which one may subdivide further, and
    elaborate, but quite enough to show you without the help of a
    picture that there are colours which cause each other to shine
    brilliantly, which form a <i>couple</i>, which complete each
    other like man and woman.</p>

    <p>Explaining the whole theory to you would involve quite a lot
    of writing, yet it might be done.</p>

    <p>Colourings, wallpapers and whatnot could be made much
    prettier by paying attention to the laws of colours.</p>

    <p>You will understand that Isra&euml;ls and Mauve, who did not
    use whole colours, who were forever working in grey - with all
    due respect and love - do not satisfy the present-day for
    colour.</p>

    <p>And another thing: somebody who can really play the violin
    or the piano is in my opinion highly amusing. He takes his
    violin and starts playing, and a whole company enjoys itself
    all through the evening. This is something a painter should be
    able to do too. And now and then it gives me pleasure, when I
    work outdoors, to have somebody looking on. Suppose, for
    instance, one is in a wheat field. Well, within a few hours one
    ought to be able to paint that wheat field, and the sky above
    it, in perspective, in the distance. Somebody witnessing this
    will, as soon as an opportunity occurs, keep his mouth shut
    about the clumsiness of the impressionists, and their
    incompetent painting - do you see?</p>

    <p>But we of the present day seldom have acquaintances who are
    sufficiently interested to accompany us - but if they do, they
    may be converted once and for all.</p>

    <p>Now contrast this with the fellows in studios who require
    months and months to do something, which is often enough rather
    insipid when all is said and done.</p>

    <p>Can't you understand then that there is something in this
    new style of painting? And there is something additional that I
    should like to have - I want to be able to paint a portrait in
    one morning or in one afternoon, which I have done
    occasionally, for that matter. This kind of work does not
    prevent one from working on other pictures for a long time. By
    yesterday's mail I sent you a drawing which is the first
    scratch for a large picture.*</p>

    <p>But isn't it curious that, as I tell you this, there are at
    least a score of fellows who in a few hours could paint a
    portrait in which there would be character - they are hardly
    ever asked to do one - some twenty fellows capable of doing
    whatever landscape you please, at whatever hour of the day with
    whatever colour effect, on the spot, without hesitation - and
    nobody stands behind them looking on? They are always working
    alone. If only everybody knew this - but this is how conditions
    are, they are so little known.</p>

    <p>But I imagine that in the next generation, or in one of the
    later generations, this working resolutely and without
    hesitation, this measuring correctly at a glance, this
    adroitness in the mixing of colours, this drawing with
    lightning speed - there will come a generation that will not
    only do this just as we are doing it now, unappreciated, but
    then with a public that will like it, in the portrayal of
    persons no less than in the portrayal of landscapes or of
    interiors.</p>

    <p>But I am writing far too much just about painting; only what
    I wanted to make you understand is this, that it is rather
    important that Theo has succeeded in introducing the business
    he manages to have a permanent exhibition of the impressionists
    now. Next year will be rather important.</p>

    <p>Just as in literature the French are irrefutably the
    masters, they are the same in painting too; and in modern art
    history, names like Delacroix, Millet, Corot, Courbet, Daumier,
    dominate all that is produced in other countries.</p>

    <p>Oh well, that clique of painters who are lording it over the
    official world nowadays adorn themselves with the laurels won
    by those of the past, but they themselves are of a far lower
    rank. Consequently <i>they</i> won't be able to contribute much
    at the forthcoming World's Fair to helping French art retain
    the importance it now has. Next year the attention, <i>not</i>
    of the public in general - which of course looks at everything
    without troubling its head about history - but the attention of
    those who are well informed will be drawn to the retrospective
    exhibition of the pictures of the big fellows who are dead,
    <i>and</i> by the impressionists. This will not instantly alter
    the circumstances in which the latter find themselves either,
    but it will certainly be conducive to the spreading of the
    ideas, and induce a little more animation. But the dull
    schoolmasters who are now on the selection committee of the
    Salon will never think of admitting the impressionists.</p>

    <p>But the latter will hardly desire this at all, and they will
    hold an exhibition of their own.</p>

    <p>If you now take into consideration that I want to have at
    least some fifty pictures ready toward that time - though I may
    not be exhibiting at all - you will perhaps feel that I am
    gradually and to a certain extent taking part in the battle in
    which, if one does participate, one is at least not exposed to
    the danger of being awarded a <i>prize</i> or a medal like a
    &ldquo;good boy.&rdquo; In point of fact these fellows are
    ambitious too, but there is a difference nevertheless, and many
    here are beginning to understand how preposterous it is to make
    oneself dependent on the opinion of others in what one
    does.</p>

    <p>I hate writing about myself, and I have no idea why I do it.
    Perhaps I do it in order to answer your questions. You see what
    I have found - my work; and you see too what I have not found -
    all the rest that belongs to life. And the future? Either I
    shall become wholly indifferent to all that does not belong to
    the work of painting, or . . . I dare not expatiate on the
    theme, seeing that this becoming exclusively a painting
    machine, unfit for and uninterested in anything else, may be so
    much better or worse than the average. It might be pretty easy
    for me to resign myself to the average, and so be it for the
    present, for I am now in the same mess as in the past.</p>

    <p>Listen, speaking about messes. Perhaps it might be worth
    while to try to save something of the &ldquo;mess&rdquo; that
    Theo tells me is still lying in some garret at Breda; however,
    I dare not ask you to do this, and perhaps it has got lost, so
    don't worry.</p>

    <p>But the question is this - you know that Theo brought a
    whole lot of wood engravings with him last year. Yet a number
    of the best portfolios are missing and the rest is less good
    because of the very fact that the collection is no longer
    complete. Of course the wood engravings from illustrated papers
    get rarer and rarer according to the age of the issues they are
    taken from. Enough - so I am not wholly indifferent to that
    &ldquo;mess,&rdquo; you see? There are, for instance, a copy of
    Gavarni's &ldquo;Human Masquerade,&rdquo; and a book Anatomy
    for Artists - in short a number of things that are really far
    too good to lose. However, I look upon them in advance as lost;
    what may be found would be pure profit. When I went away, I did
    not know it would be for good. For the work at Nuenen did not
    go badly, and it was only a matter of continuing it; <i>I still
    feel the want</i> of my models, who seemed to be made for me,
    and whom I still adore; if only I had them here - I feel sure
    my fifty pictures would turn out to be hits. Do you understand
    this?? I am not the master of mankind because I am this or that
    - I fully grant in advance that those who say so are right -
    but I feel grieved because I do not have the power to make
    those I want to pose for me to do it, wherever I want them, and
    as long as I want them.</p>

    <p><i>There</i>, and not in the technical difficulties, lies
    the obstacle, which I shall have to clear out of the way in the
    end. And today I am a landscape painter, whereas in reality
    portrait painting would suit me better. So it would not
    surprise me if at some future time I should change my style.
    One painter - Chaplin - who paints the most beautiful women of
    Paris gloriously - ladies in boudoirs, with or without costume
    - has painted vigorous landscapes and herds of pigs on the
    heath. What I want to say is that one must do the work that is
    nearest, and retain a hold on one's technique. If you were
    within my reach I am greatly afraid you would get irretrievably
    addicted to painting. There are Parisian ladies, at least one
    of them really good, among the impressionists - even two good
    ones.</p>

    <p>And when I think that it is precisely this new style which
    would put women who are <i>incapable</i> of pernickety
    accuracy, who feel musically, on the right track, I regret now
    and then that I am getting older and uglier than my interest
    demands.</p>

    <p>It is very commendable of Theo to have invited you to come
    to Paris. I don't know how it would impress you. When I saw it
    for the first time, I felt above all the dreary misery, which
    one cannot wave away, as little as one can wave away the
    tainted air in a hospital, however clean it may be kept. And
    this remained with me afterward - though later on I gained the
    impression that it is also a hotbed of ideas, and that people
    try to get everything out of life that can by the remotest
    chance be got out of it. Other cities become small in
    comparison with it, and it seems as big as the sea. There one
    always leaves behind a considerable part of one's life. But one
    thing is certain, <i>nothing is fresh there</i>. Therefore,
    when one leaves it, one thinks a lot of things elsewhere
    excellent.</p>

    <p>I am extremely glad you have regained your health. All that
    one does, one does involuntarily; and so, without understanding
    it oneself for the moment, one does wrong when one falls
    ill.</p>

    <p><i>It is my impression</i> that you would <i>not</i> think
    the sun here unpleasant at all; I feel it is excellent for me
    to work in the open air during the hottest part of the day. It
    is a dry, clean heat.</p>

    <p>Essentially the colour is exquisite here. When the green
    leaves are fresh, it is a rich green, the like of which we
    seldom see in the North, quiet. When it gets scorched and
    dusty, it does not lose its beauty, for then the landscape gets
    tones of gold of various tints, green-gold, yellow-gold,
    pink-gold, and in the same way bronze, copper, in short
    starting from citron yellow all the way to a dull, dark yellow
    colour like a heap of threshed corn, for instance. And this
    combined with the blue - from the deepest royal blue of the
    water to the blue of the forget-me-nots, cobalt, particularly
    clear, bright blue - green-blue and violet-blue.</p>

    <p>Of course this calls up orange - a sunburned face gives the
    impression of orange. Furthermore, on account of the many
    yellow hues, violet gets a quick emphasis; a cane fence or a
    grey thatched roof or a dug-up field make a much more violet
    impression than at home. Furthermore - something you've already
    suspected - people are often good-looking here. In a word, I
    believe that life here is just a little more satisfying than in
    many other spots. However, I have the impression that people
    are getting slack here, a little too much affected by the
    decadence of carelessness, indifference, whereas if they were
    more energetic the land would probably produce more.</p>

    <p>I have not had much time to read lately, except Madame
    Chrysanth&egrave;me by Pierre Loti, and also L'Abb&eacute;
    Constantin by Ohnet, frightfully sweet and heavenly, so that
    even his Ma&icirc;tre des forges, which already shows a similar
    tendency, becomes all the more suspect. At times, driven by a
    certain mental voracity, I even read the newspapers with fury,
    but do not deduce from this fact that I feel a craving for
    reading. This is not really the case to a large extent, because
    I prefer to look at things myself; but the fact is that one
    gets into the habit of reading for a few hours at night, so one
    cannot help feeling as if one were in want of something; but
    that this feeling is not really distressing, one may infer from
    the fact that one goes on thinking what one <i>sees</i>
    interesting.</p>

    <p>I have spent a week on the Mediterranean coast; you should
    think it beautiful. What strikes me here, and what makes
    painting so attractive, is the clearness of the air; you
    <i>cannot</i> know what this means, because this is exactly
    what we do not have in our country - but one distinguishes the
    colour of things at an hour's distance; for instance the
    grey-green of the olive trees and the grass green of the
    meadows, and the pink-lilac of a dug-up field. In our country
    we see a vague grey line on the horizon; here even in the far,
    far distance the line is sharply defined, and its shape is
    clearly distinguishable. This gives one an idea of space and
    air.</p>

    <p>Seeing that I am so busily occupied with myself just now, I
    want to try to paint my self-portrait in writing. In the first
    place I want to emphasize the fact that one and the same person
    may furnish motifs for very different portraits.</p>

    <p>Here I give a conception of mine, which is the result of <art id=0522>a
    portrait I painted in the mirror, and which is now in Theo's
    possession.</art></p>

    <p>A pinkish-grey face with green eyes, ash-coloured hair,
    wrinkles on the forehead and around the mouth, stiff, wooden, a
    very red beard, considerably neglected and mournful, but the
    lips are full, a blue peasant's blouse of coarse linen, and a
    palette with citron yellow, vermilion, malachite green, cobalt
    blue, in short all the colours on the palette except the orange
    beard, but only whole colours. The figure against a
    greyish-white wall.</p>

    <p>You will say that this resembles somewhat, for instance, the
    face of - Death - in Van Eeden's book or some such thing - all
    right, but it is a figure like this - and it isn't an easy job
    to paint oneself - at any rate if it is to be <i>different</i>
    from a photograph. And you see - this, in my opinion, is the
    advantage that impressionism possesses over all the other
    things; it is not banal, and one seeks after a deeper
    resemblance than the photographer's.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.appearance">However, at the present moment I look different,
    insofar as I am wearing neither hair nor beard, the same having been
    shaved off clean. Furthermore, my complexion has changed from
    green-greyish-pink to greyish-orange, and I am wearing a white
    suit instead of a blue one, and I am always very dusty, always
    more bristlingly loaded like a porcupine, with sticks,
    painter's easel, canvases and further merchandise. Only the
    green eyes have remained the same, but of course another colour
    in the portrait is the yellow straw hat, like a
    <i>hannekenmaaier's</i>, <sup>3</sup> and a very black little
    pipe</label> - I live in a little yellow house with a green door and
    green blinds, whitewashed inside - on the white walls very
    brightly coloured Japanese prints, red tiles on the floor - the
    house in the full sunlight - and over it an intensely blue sky,
    and - the shadows in the middle of the day much shorter than in
    our country. Well - can you understand that one may be able to
    paint something like this with only a few strokes of the brush?
    But can't you understand too that there are people who say,
    &ldquo;This makes too queer an impression,&rdquo; not to
    mention those who think it a total abortion or utterly
    repulsive? But if only there is a likeness, but a likeness
    different from the products of the God-fearing photographer
    with his colourless phantoms - this is the aim.</p>

    <p>I am positively not very fond of Mr. Vosmaer, <sup>4</sup>
    and am sufficiently hardhearted to be little impressed by the
    man's departure from life.</p>

    <p>I think it a very good thing that you and Mother preferred
    to get hold of a garden with she-cats, tom-cats, sparrows and
    flies, rather than put up with another flight of stairs. <label content="psychology.neurological">In
    Paris I could never accustom myself to climbing stairs, and I
    always had fits of dizziness in a horrible nightmare which has
    left me since, but which came back regularly then.</label></p>

    <p>If I should not mail this letter immediately, I feel
    absolutely sure that I should tear it up if I read it over -
    and so I will not read it over, and I think its legibility
    doubtful. I don't always have time to write. I truly believe
    there is nothing in this letter, and I should not be able to
    understand by what means it got this long. Thank Mother in my
    name for her letter. A long time ago now I designated a painted
    study for you, and you are sure to get it. I am afraid that if
    I should send it by parcel post, even if I prepaid the
    carriage, I should make you pay for insufficient postage, as in
    the case of the flowers from Menton, and this one is even
    bigger - but Theo will be sure to send you one; so if I should
    not think of it, please ask him for it.</p>

    <p>I embrace you and Mother in thought.</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>

    <p>Theo is doing his best for all the impressionists; he has
    done something, or sold something, for every one of them, and
