  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    Thank you for your letter and the 100-Fr. note enclosed. I
    very much hope that you are right in thinking Tersteeg will come to Paris
    shortly. It's very much to be desired with things in the state you
    say they are in - everyone on the rocks and hard up. I was very
    much interested in what you write on the Lan&ccedil;on sale,
    and about the painter's mistress. He did some work of very
    great character; his drawing often reminded me very much of
    Mauve. I am sorry I did not see the exhibition of his studies and
    very sorry not to have seen the Willette exhibition as well.<br>

    What do you think of the news that Kaiser Wilhelm is dead?
    Will this precipitate events in France, and is Paris going to remain
    quiet? It's doubtful; and what will the effect of all this be
    on the trade in paintings? I read that there seems to be some question
    of abolishing the import duties on paintings into America; is this
    true?<br>

    <label content="business.co-op">Perhaps it would be easier to get a few dealers and
    collectors to agree to buy the impressionist paintings than to
    get the artists to agree to share the price of
    their paintings.<br>

    Nevertheless, the artists couldn't do better than to get together,
    and give over to the association, and share the proceeds
    of the sales, so that the society could at least guarantee its
    members a chance to live and to work.<br>

    If de Gas [Degas], Claude Monet, Renoir, Sisley and C. Pissarro
    took the initiative, saying, &ldquo;Look here, we 5 give 10
    paintings each (or rather we each give to the value of 10,000
    Frs. to be estimated by expert members such as Tersteeg and
    yourself, co-opted by the Society, said experts likewise to put
    in capital in the form of paintings) and we further undertake to
    hand over every year pictures to the value of&hellip;<br>

    &ldquo;And we invite you others, Guillaumin, Seurat, Gauguin, etc.,
    etc., to join with us (your paintings to undergo the same
    expert evaluation).&rdquo;<br>

    Thus the great impressionists of the Grand Boulevard, while
    giving pictures which would become general property, would keep
    their prestige, and the others could no longer reproach them
    with keeping to themselves the advantages of a reputation no
    doubt acquired primarily through their personal efforts and
    individual genius, but all the same a reputation that is
    growing, buttressed and actually maintained by the paintings of
    a whole battalion of artists who have been working in perpetual
    poverty.<br>

    Anyway, it is to be hoped that it will come off, and that
    Tersteeg and you will become expert members (with
    Portier, perhaps?).</label><br>

    I have two more studies of landscapes. I hope that the work
    will go on steadily now, and that in a month I shall be able to
    send you a first consignment. I say in a month, because I want
    to send you only the best, and because I want them to be dry,
    and because I want to send at least a dozen at a time, owing to
    the expense of carriage.<br>

    I congratulate you on purchasing the Seurat; with what I
    will be sending you, you must try to arrange another exchange with
    Seurat as well.<br>

    You realize that if Tersteeg joins you in this business,
    between you two you could easily persuade Boussod Valadon to grant
    a regular credit for the necessary purchases. But it is urgent,
    since failing that, the dealers will cut the ground from under your feet.<br>

    I have made the acquaintance of a Danish artist [Mourier
    Peterson] who talks about Heyerdahl and other Northerners,
    Kroyer, etc. His work is dry, but very conscientious, and he is
    still young. Some time ago he saw the exhibition of the
    impressionists in the Rue Lafitte. He is probably going to
    Paris for the Salon, and wants to make a tour in Holland to see
    the museums.<br>

    I quite approve of your exhibiting <art id=0359>the &ldquo;Livres&rdquo;
    with the Independents; its title ought to be &ldquo;Romans
    Parisiens.&rdquo;</art><br>

    I should be so glad to hear that you had managed to persuade
    Tersteeg - but we must be patient.<br>

    I had to get 50 francs worth of stuff when your letter
    arrived.This week I shall set four or five things going.<br>

    I am daily thinking about this association of artists, and the
    plan has developed further in my mind; but Tersteeg must be in
    it, a lot depends on that. As a matter of fact, the artists
    would have Tersteeg's help. Without that we should be left
    listening from morning till night to the lamentations of them
    all as a whole, and each man in particular would be
    everlastingly coming to ask for explanations, axioms and so
    forth. I should not be surprised if Tersteeg's view will be
    that we cannot do without the artists of the Grand Boulevard,
    and that he will try to persuade them to take the initiative
    towards our association by giving paintings which would become
    common property, no longer individual. If they were to make the
    proposal, the Petit Boulevard, in my opinion, would be morally
    obliged to join.<br>

    And these gentlemen of the Grand Boulevard will keep their
    present reputation only if they can forestall the not unfounded
    criticisms of the lesser impressionists, who will say,
    &ldquo;Everything goes into <i>your</i> pockets.&rdquo;<br>

    To which they might well make reply, &ldquo;Not at all, on
    the contrary, we are the first to say that <i>our</i> pictures
    belong <i>to the artists</i>!&rdquo; If de Gas, Monet, Renoir
    and Pissarro were to say that, even allowing plenty of margin
    for their individual ideas when it comes to putting it into
    practice, they could do worse, if only by saying nothing at all
    and letting things slide.<br>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
