  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your kind letter. If you remember, mine
    ended with &ldquo;we are getting old, that is what it
    <i>is</i>, the rest is imagination and doesn't exist.&rdquo;
    Well, I said that more for myself than for you. And I said it
    because I felt the absolute necessity of behaving accordingly,
    of working, perhaps not more, but with a deeper
    understanding.</p>

    <p>Now you talk of the emptiness you feel everywhere, it is
    just the very thing I feel myself.</p>

    <p>Considering, if you like, the time in which we live a great
    and true renaissance of art, the worm-eaten official tradition
    still alive but really impotent and inactive, the new painters
    isolated, poor, treated like madmen, and because of this
    treatment actually becoming so, at least as far as their social
    life is concerned.</p>

    <p>Then remember that you are doing exactly the same work as
    these primitive painters, since you provide them with money and
    sell their canvases for them, which enables them to produce
    others. If a painter ruins his character by working hard at
    painting, a thing which leaves him useless for many other
    things, for family life, etc., etc., if therefore he paints not
    only with colours, but with self-denial and self-renunciation
    and with a broken heart - as far as you are concerned, your own
    work is not only no better paid than his, but it costs you
    exactly what the painter's cost him, this sacrifice of the
    individuality, half voluntary, half accidental.</p>

    <p>That is to say that if you paint <i>indirectly</i>, you are
    more productive than I am, for instance. The more irrevocably
    you become a dealer, the more you become an artist.</p>

    <p>And in the same way I hope the same thing for myself. The
    more I am spent, ill, a broken pitcher, by so much more am I an
    artist - a creative artist - in this great renaissance of art
    of which we speak.</p>

    <p>These things are surely so, but this eternally living art,
    and this renaissance, this green shoot springing up from the
    roots of the old felled trunk, these are such abstract things
    that a kind of melancholy remains within us when we think that
    one could have created life at less cost than creating art.</p>

    <p>If possible, you ought to make me feel that art is alive,
    you who love art perhaps more than I do. I tell myself that it
    depends not on art but on myself, that the only way to get back
    my confidence and peace of mind is to <i>improve my
    work</i>.</p>

    <p>And there we are again, back at the end of my last letter -
    I am getting old, it's sheer imagination if I should think that
    art is old lumber too.</p>

    <p>Now if you know what a &ldquo;mousm&eacute;&rdquo; is (you
    will find out when you read Loti's Madame Chrysanth&egrave;me),
    I have just painted one. It took me a whole week, and I haven't
    been able to do anything else, because I still haven't been too
    well. This is what annoys me - but I felt well, I would have
    been able to run off some more landscapes in the meantime, but
    to do justice to my mousm&eacute; I had to conserve my mental
    energies. <art id=0413>A mousm&eacute; is a Japanese girl - Proven&ccedil;al
    in this case - 12 to 14 years old</art>. That makes
    two portraits now, <art id=0423>the Zouave</art> and her.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">Take care of your health, above all take baths <i>if Gruby
    recommends it</i>, for in the four years by which I am older
    than you, you will see how necessary comparatively good health
    is for being able to work.</label> Now for us who work with our brains,
    our one and only hope of not breaking down too soon is this
    artificial eking-out by an up-to-date hygienic regimen
    rigorously applied, as much as we can stand. Because I for one
    do not do everything I ought. And a bit of cheerfulness is
    better than all the other remedies.</p>

    <p>I have had a letter from Russell. He says that he would have
    written me before if he hadn't been busy moving to Belle Ile.
    He is there now, and says that he would be pleased if sooner or
    later I would go and spend some time there. He still wants to
    repaint my portrait. He says too - &ldquo;I should have gone to
    Boussod's to see Gauguin's `Negresses Talking' if the same
    thing had not prevented me from that too.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In short, he does not refuse to buy one, but makes it clear
    he does not want anything inferior to the one we have. You see
    that at all events that is better than nothing.</p>

    <p>I will write this to Gauguin and ask him for sketches of
    pictures. We must hurry things and give up R. for the moment,
    but regard it as a matter that will come off, but is in
    abeyance now.</p>

    <p>And the same goes for Guillaumin.</p>

    <p>I wish he [Russell] would buy a figure from G. He says that
    he has had a very beautiful bust of his wife done by Rodin, and
    that on this occasion he lunched with Claude Monet and saw the
    10 pictures of Antibes. I am sending him Geffroy's article. He
    criticizes the Monets very ably, begins by liking them very
    much, the attack on the problem, the enfolding tinted air, the
    colour. After that he shows what there is to find fault with -
    the total lack of construction, for instance one of his trees
    will have far too much foliage for the thickness of the trunk,
    and so always and everywhere from the standpoint of the reality
    of things, from the standpoint of lots of natural <i>laws</i>,
    he is exasperating enough. He ends by saying that this quality
    of attacking the difficulties is what everyone ought to
    have.</p>

    <p>Bernard has sent me 10 sketches like his brothel; three of
    them were &agrave; la Redon; I do not altogether share the
    enthusiasm he has for that. But there is a woman washing
    herself, very Rembrandtesque, an effect like Goya, and a
    landscape with figures, very strange. He expressly forbade me
    to send them to you, but all the same you will get them by the
    same post.</p>

    <p>I think that Russell will buy something more from
    Bernard.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile I have seen this Bock's work; it is strictly
    impressionistic, but not powerful, it is the stage where this
    new technique still preoccupies him so much that he cannot be
    himself. He will gain in force and then his individuality will
    break free, I think. But McKnight does water colours of the
    quality of those by Destr&eacute;e, you remember that Dutchman
    we used to know. However, he has washed some small still lifes;
    a yellow pot on a violet foreground, a red pot on a green, an
    orange pot on blue, better, but very poor.</p>

    <p>The village where they are staying is <i>real Millet</i>,
    poor peasants and nothing else, absolutely <i>rustic</i> and
    homely. This quality completely escapes them. I think that
    McKnight has civilized and converted to civilized Christianity
    his brute of a landlord. Anyway the swine and his worthy
    spouse, when you go there, shake hands with you - it is in a
    caf&eacute;, of course - when you ask for drinks, they have a
    way of refusing money - Oh! I could not take money from an
    artiss&rdquo; - with two es<i>s</i>es. Anyway, it is their own
    fault that it is so abominable, and this Bock must get pretty
    well stultified in McKnight's company.</p>

    <p>I think that McKnight has some money but not much. So they
    contaminate the village; but for that, I'd go there to work
    often. What one ought to do there is not to talk to the
    civilized people; now they know the station master and a score
    of bores, and that is partly why they get nowhere. Naturally
    these simple and artless country folk laugh at them and despise
    them. But if they did their work without taking up with these
    village loungers with their starched collars, then they could
    go into the peasants' homes and let them earn a few pence. And
    then this blessed Fontvieilles would be a gold mine for them;
    but the natives are like Zola's poor peasants, innocent and
    gentle beings, as we know.</p>

    <p>Probably McKnight will soon be making little landscapes with
    sheep for chocolate boxes.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.appearance">Not only my pictures but I myself have become haggard of
    late, almost like Hugo van der Goes in the picture by Emil
    Wauters.</p>

    <p>Only, having got my whole beard carefully shaved off I think
    that I am as much like the very placid priest in the same
    picture as like the mad painter so intelligently portrayed
    therein.</label></p>

    <p>And I do not mind being rather between the two, for one must
    live, especially because it is no use ignoring the fact that
    there may be a crisis some day or other if you were to change
    your relations with the Boussods. Another reason for keeping up
    this connection with artists, on my part as much as on
    yours.</p>

    <p>Besides, I think I have spoken the truth, but if I should
    succeed in replacing in goods the money spent, I should only be
    doing my duty. And then, something practical I can do is
    portrait painting.</p>

    <p>As for drinking too much ... if it is bad, I can't tell. But
    look at Bismarck, who is in any case very practical and very
    intelligent, his good doctor told him that he was drinking too
    much, and that all his life he had overtaxed his stomach and
    his brain. Bismarck immediately stopped drinking. After that he
    got run down and couldn't pick up. Secretly he must be laughing
    heartily at his doctor, because fortunately for him he did not
    consult him sooner.</p>

    <p>So much for that, a good handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Mind, as to Gauguin we must not give up the idea of coming
    to his aid if the suggestion is acceptable as it stands, but
    <i>we do not need him</i>. So do not think that working alone
    bothers me, and do not push the affair on my account, <i>be
    very sure of that</i>.</p>

    <p>The portrait of the girl is against a background of white
    strongly tinged with malachite green, her bodice is striped
    blood red and violet, the skirt is royal blue, with large
    yellow-orange dots. The mat flesh tones are yellowish-grey; the
    hair tinged with violet; the eyebrows and the eyelashes are
    black; the eyes, orange with Prussian blue. A branch of
    oleander in her fingers, for the two hands are showing.</p>
