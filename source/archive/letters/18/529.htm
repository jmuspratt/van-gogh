    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I shall have to pay my rent on September 1, and if you could
    send the week's money the day you get your month's pay, I could
    pay the rent on time, then the outlay would be spread over two
    weeks. And if you could send the money on Sunday by letter or
    by a telegraph order, I should not be sorry to gain a day in
    this way.</p>

    <p>I have two models this week: an Arl&eacute;sienne and <art id=0444>the
    old peasant. I am doing him this time against a background of
    vivid orange which, although it does not pretend to be the
    image of a red sunset, may nevertheless give a suggestion of
    one</art>.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately I am afraid that the little Arl&eacute;sienne
    will not turn up for the rest of the picture. As a matter of
    fact, the last time she came, she asked me for all the money I
    had promised her for posing in advance, and as I made no
    objection to that, she has made off and I have not seen her
    again. But some day or other she is bound to come back; it
    would be a little too thick if she failed me altogether.</p>

    <p>I am also working on a bunch of flowers, and <art id=0461>a still life of
    an old pair of shoes</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">I have heaps of ideas for my work, and if I go on with
    figure painting very industriously, I may possibly find more.
    But what's the use? Sometimes I feel too feeble to fight
    against existing circumstances, and I should have to be
    cleverer and richer and younger to win.</label></p>

    <p>Fortunately for me, I do not hanker after victory any more,
    and all that I seek in painting is a way to make life
    bearable.</p>

    <p>Still no reply from Russell. He can't have a penny just now.</p>

    <p>I hope our sister has seen the Luxembourg again by now.</p>

    <p>We have had two or three perfect days here, very hot and no
    wind. The grapes are beginning to ripen, but I hear that they
    will not be good.</p>

    <p>I must work again today. I have qualms about the last days
    of this week, because of those models.</p>

    <p>I am negotiating with some other people to pose for me.
    There is something always driving me on to do as many figure
    studies as ever I can.</p>

    <p>In the future things may well be worse again, and then
    whatever comes, once I have made myself master of the figure, I
    think the work will seem deeper.</p>

    <p>A handshake for you and our sister,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Difficulties with models continue with exactly the same
    tenacity as the mistral here. It is not cheering.</p>
