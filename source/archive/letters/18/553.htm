    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>A letter from Gauguin telling me that he has sent you some
    pictures and studies. I'd be very glad if you could find time
    to write me some details of what they are. With his letter was
    one from Bernard, saying that they had received the canvases I
    sent, and that they are going to keep all seven. Bernard will
    send me another study in exchange, and the three others, Moret,
    Laval, and a young man will also send me portraits, I hope.
    Gauguin has <art id=0476>my portrait</art> and Bernard says he would like to have
    one like it, though he already has one of me, which I exchanged
    with him some time ago for the portrait of his grandmother.</p>

    <p>And I am pleased to hear that they did not dislike what I
    have done in figure painting.</p>

    <p><label content="health.fatigue">I have been and still am nearly half-dead from the past
    week's work. I cannot do any more yet, and besides, there is a
    very violent mistral that raises clouds of dust which whiten
    the trees on the plain from top to bottom. So I am forced to be
    quiet. I have just slept sixteen hours at a stretch, and it has
    restored me considerably.</p>

    <p>And tomorrow I shall have recovered from this queer
    turn.</label></p>

    <p>But I have done a good week's work, truly, with five
    canvases. If that somewhat takes it out of one, well, it's
    natural. If I had worked more quietly, you can easily see that
    the mistral would have caught me again. If it is fine here you
    must take advantage of it, otherwise you would never do
    anything.</p>

    <p>Say, what is Seurat doing? If you see him, tell him from me
    that I am working on a scheme of decoration which has now got
    to 15 square size 30 canvases, and which will take at least 15
    others to make a whole, and that in this work on a larger
    scale, it is often the memory of his personality and of the
    visit we made to his studio to see his beautiful great canvases
    that encourages me in this task.</p>

    <p>I wish we had the self-portrait of Seurat. I told Gauguin
    that if I urged him to make an exchange of portraits it was
    because I thought that Bernard and he were sure to have made
    several studies of each other already. And since that was not
    so and he had done the portrait expressly for me, I did not
    want it as an exchange, as I thought it was too important for
    that. He wrote to say that he was determined I should have it
    in exchange, his letter is again very complimentary; as I don't
    deserve it, we will say no more.</p>

    <p>I am sending you an article on Provence which seems well
    written to me. These F&eacute;libres are a literary and
    artistic society, Clovis Hugues, Mistral and others, who write
    fairly good, sometimes very good, sonnets in Proven&ccedil;al
    and sometimes in French.</p>

    <p>If the F&eacute;libres stop being unaware of my existence
    someday, they will all come to the little house. I would rather
    this did not happen before I have finished my decorations. But
    since I love Provence as unreservedly as they do, I perhaps
    have a right to their attention. If I ever insist on that
    right, it will be so that my work may remain here or in
    Marseilles, where as you know I should so much like to work.
    Because I believe that the artists of Marseilles would do well
    to continue what Monticelli began.</p>

    <p>If Gauguin and I were to write an article in one of the
    papers here, that would be enough to get in touch with
    them.</p>

    <p>A handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
