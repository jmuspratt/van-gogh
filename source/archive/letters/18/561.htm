  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">I have received a letter from M. C. Dujardin on the subject
    of the exhibition of my pictures in his black hole. I am go
    disgusted at the idea of handing over a canvas in payment for
    the proposed exhibition that really there is only one possible
    answer to the gentleman's letter. The one you will find
    enclosed. Only I am sending it to you and not to him so that
    you may know what I think, and that you may simply tell him
    that I have changed my mind, and at the moment have no desire
    to exhibit. Getting angry with the scoundrel doesn't do the
    slightest bit of good, it is better to be conventionally
    polite. So no exhibition at the Revue Ind&eacute;pendante; I
    boldly venture to think that Gauguin is also of this opinion.
    In any case he is making no attempt to persuade me to do
    it.</label></p>

    <p>We have hardly exhibited, have we? There have been a few
    canvases, first at Tanguy's, afterward at Thomas's, and then at
    Martin's.</p>

    <p>Now as for myself, I tell you flatly that I can see no use
    even in that, and it really seems to me much better if you
    simply keep the studies you like in your apartment, and send
    the others back here rolled up, since the apartment is small,
    and if you kept everything, they would crowd it up.</p>

    <p>Then, without hurrying ourselves, I am going on down here,
    getting the staff ready for a more serious exhibition.</p>

    <p>But as for the Revue Ind&eacute;pendante, please tell them
    curtly it's no go. It's too good an opportunity, and you will
    feel that they are greatly mistaken if they think I am going to
    pay for being put on view in such a dark, suspect little hole
    as that.</p>

    <p>Now as to showing a few canvases at Tanguy's and Thomas's,
    it's a matter of such indifference to me that it isn't worth
    talking about, but above all remember that I simply don't care.
    I already know what I shall do the moment I have enough
    canvases. Right now I am only concerned with making them.</p>

    <p>What will please you is that Gauguin has finished his canvas
    of the &ldquo;Women Grape Gatherers.&rdquo; It is as beautiful
    as <art id=egreeses>the Negresses</art>, and if you paid say the same price as for the
    Negresses (400, I think) it would be well worth it. But of
    course you have the lot to choose from, and I have not seen the
    Breton things. He has described several to me, and they must be
    fine.</p>

    <p>I have done <art id=0478>a rough sketch of the brothel</art>,
    and I quite intend to do a brothel picture. Gauguin came here
    on October 20, so we must figure that he had 50 francs from you
    last month.</p>

    <p>Yes, I think there must be a clear understanding about the
    exhibition of my work. You are with the Goupils, you have no
    right to do business outside the firm. I myself, being away, do
    <i>not</i> exhibit. I repeat, it is another matter at Tanguy's
    provided Tanguy fully understands that he has no right to my
    canvases <i>whatever</i>.</p>

    <p>Then my position is at least clear, which is not altogether
    immaterial to me.</p>

    <p>With a little more work behind me, I shall have enough not
    to have to exhibit at all, that is what I am aiming at.</p>

    <p>I too have finished <art id=0495>a canvas of a vineyard all purple and
    yellow, with small blue and violet figures and a yellow sun</art>.</p>

    <p>I think that you will be able to put this canvas besides
    some of Monticelli's landscapes.</p>

    <p>I am going to set myself to work from memory often, and the
    canvases from memory are always less awkward, and have a more
    artistic look than studies from nature, especially when one
    works in mistral weather.</p>

    <p>I think I haven't yet told you that Milliet has gone to
    Africa. He got a study of mine for troubling to take the
    canvases to Paris [Unknown painting], and Gauguin gave him a small drawing in
    exchange for an illustrated edition of Madame
    Chrysanth&egrave;me. I have not yet received the exchanges from
    Pont-Aven, but Gauguin assures me that the canvases were
    finished.</p>

    <p>We are having wind and rain here, and I am very glad not to
    be alone. I work from memory on bad days, and that would not do
    if I were alone.</p>

    <p>Gauguin has also almost finished his night caf&eacute;. He
    is very interesting as a friend,<label content="food-and-drink.diet"> I must tell you that he knows
    how to cook <i>perfectly</i>; I think I shall learn from him,
    it is very convenient.</label> We find it very easy to make frames with
    plain strips of wood nailed on the stretcher and
    <i>painted</i>, and I have begun doing this.</p>

    <p><?showImage("696_V-T_5610");?>
    </p>

    <p>Do you know that Gauguin is really partly the inventor of
    the white frame? But the frame of four strips nailed on the
    stretcher costs <i>5 sous</i>, and we are certainly going to
    perfect it. It does very well, because the frame has no
    projection, and is one with the picture.</p>

    <p>Good-by for now, a handshake for you, and my compliments to
    the Dutchmen.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Gauguin sends his greetings, and asks you to keep, out of
    the price of the first picture you sell, the amount necessary
    for the stretchers with screws that he wants, and also what
    Bernard will be asking you for a commission he gave him.</p>
