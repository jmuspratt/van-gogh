    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>If Gauguin is agreeable, and if there is only the difficulty
    of removal to get over before we get going, it would be better
    not to keep him dangling. So I have written, though I hardly
    had time, as I have two canvases on the easel. If you think the
    letter clear enough, send it; if not, in case of doubt it's
    better to do nothing. And whatever you do for him must not
    upset your plan of sending for our sister, and above all, your
    own needs and mine. For if we cannot keep ourselves in good
    condition, how can we pretend to lend a hand in other people's
    difficulties? But now we are actually on the way to a sound,
    strenuous life, and so if possible let's do the work that is
    nearest.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">I send enclosed a sample of canvas for Tasset, but I do not
    know whether I should go on with his canvas.</label></p>

    <p>If you send me the next letter on Sunday <i>morning</i>, I
    shall probably take myself off that day to Saintes-Maries to
    spend a week there. I am reading a book on Wagner which I will
    send you afterward. What an artist - one like that in painting
    would be something. It <i>will come</i>.</p>

    <p>Do you know this -</p>

    <p>At 6, Rue Co&euml;llogon, Rue de Rennes,</p>

    <p>On the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> of June, from 1 to
    7 P.M.</p>

    <p>Exhibition of pictures and drawings by R&eacute;gamey.</p>

    <p>It might be very interesting, as they travelled everywhere,
    he and his brother.</p>

    <p>A handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I believe in the victory of Gauguin and the other artists,
    but it's a long time between then and now, and although he may
    have the luck to sell one or two canvases, it would be just the
    same. Meanwhile Gauguin may croak like M&eacute;ryon,
    disheartened; it is bad that he is not working - but we shall
    see what his answer is.</p>
