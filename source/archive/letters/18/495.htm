  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>If the roll is not too big to be accepted by the post
    office, you will receive <art id=1452>another big pen drawing</art>, which I would
    very much like the Pissarros to see if they come on Sunday. I
    have just received part of the paints order, and thank you very
    much for it.</p>

    <p>Early tomorrow I start for Saintes-Maries on the
    Mediterranean. I shall stay there till Saturday evening.</p>

    <p>I am taking two canvases, but I'm rather afraid it will
    probably be too windy to paint.</p>

    <p>You go by diligence, it is 50 kilometers from here. You
    cross the Camargue, grass plains where there are herds of
    fighting bulls and also herds of little white horses, half wild
    and very beautiful.</p>

    <p>I am taking especially whatever I need for drawing. I must
    draw a great deal, for the very reason you spoke of in your
    last letter. Things here have so much line. And I want to get
    my drawings more spontaneous, more exaggerated. I am still
    worried by your travel plans, or rather the proposals which
    have been made to you about travelling.</p>

    <p>Travelling beats you up, and above all it disturbs the brain
    more than can be good for you.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I feel that I am to blame for it, and tell myself
    that it is my need for money that is driving you to it. No -
    it's not right.</p>

    <p>Then I say to myself that we can begin to hope that in a
    little while I shall sell one or two pictures a month, <i>for
    they are improving</i>. Keep putting them off and talk to Gruby
    about it; I venture to think that he would rather you kept
    quiet for a year. If I am wrong, and if Gruby thinks that a
    change would be good - but this cannot be so. I have written to
    Gauguin, and said only that I was sorry we were working so far
    from one another, and that it was a pity that several painters
    did not combine for one campaign.</p>

    <p>We must count on this by dragging on for years perhaps
    before the impressionists have a steady value, and so we must
    consider that helping him will be a lengthy business. But he
    has such great talent that being associated with him would be a
    step forward for us.</p>

    <p>I was quite serious when I first told you that, if you like,
    I will go to America with you, provided that it would be a good
    long stay and would be worth the trouble.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">We must try not to become ill, for if we do, we are <i>more
    isolated</i> than, for instance, the poor concierge who has
    just died. These people have their own set, and see the comings
    and goings of the household, and live in foolishness. And here
    are we alone with our thoughts and there are times we could
    wish we were fools too. Given the physique we have, we need to
    live with our own crowd.</label></p>

    <p>Enclosed is a line of farewell to Koning. I must get some
    stuff done that might persuade somebody like Thomas, for
    instance, to join you in sending people who would go to work
    down here. In that case I think that Gauguin would be sure to
    come.</p>

    <p>With a handshake - many thanks for the paints.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>It would be a great risk to take Gauguin, but we must aim at
    this, and I hope that you will find Tersteeg a help, or Thomas,
    or somebody, I don't know who, but I hope so.</p>
