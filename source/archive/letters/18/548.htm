  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.diet">Yesterday I sent you a wire asking you for another 20
    francs, I shall have nothing but that for my food all the week,
    but I have my frames at last and some stretchers.</label></p>

    <p>Only don't let the next letter come later than Sunday, for
    it is a close, very close siege these days. But we will hold
    out, and I feel quite calm amid all the commotions we are
    passing through.</p>

    <p>At the very moment I was writing these words, I received
    notice of the arrival of Tasset's canvas. Great!</p>

    <p>The walnut frames go well with the studies. And I think that
    the next batch will be decisive, and that as for selling, we
    are getting very hot.</p>

    <p>Let's be sensible, and not forget for a minute that not only
    for our own sake but also for the success of this studio, we
    must get back the money spent during the unproductive years. We
    shall if we keep calm; besides, it is our due and we have
    suffered enough for it.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">But I beg you to try to make it up with the Bagues. What I
    mean is, we are getting too old to fight against the existing
    businesses, and the best policy will probably be to go on
    quietly accepting the realities of today. It costs a great deal
    to found another business, and to use the existing ones cost
    nothing at all. So then, if you see Bague, explain to him that
    coming to a country quite new to me, I began to do studies
    right and left, and sent you two batches of them, but that if
    there are any pictures among them, there are only two or three
    at the most, such as the<art id=0403> &ldquo;White Orchard&rdquo;</art> and the
    <art id=0412>&ldquo;Harvest&rdquo; with a ruin in the background</art>.</p>

    <p>At the moment, however, I am able to concentrate. And as for
    the new things - ah, these are costing us dear, and we must not
    be too easy-going in selling them, they must bring what they
    are worth.</label></p>

    <p>Let's hope that we shall not be too much on the rocks. With
    patience it won't be too difficult for us to do as Mauve and
    Mesdag did, who were able to wait and force the price up a
    little, and still got sold. We are sparing nothing to get a
    certain richness in colour. And I believe that the thought of
    gaining something as much for the comrades as for ourselves
    will give us confidence. And even if we have no fixed plan in
    business, everything we do will be based on our deep conviction
    of the injustice which the artists we know are now suffering
    under, and on the desire to change all this as much as we can.
    With that conviction we can work on calmly and with a will, and
    after all we have nothing to fear from anyone.</p>

    <p>I am working on <art id=0477>a portrait of Mother</art>,
    because the black-and-white photograph annoys me so. Ah, what
    portraits could be made from nature with photography and
    painting! I always hope that we are still to have a great
    revolution in portraiture.</p>

    <p>I am writing home for Father's portrait also. I do not want
    to have black photographs, but I do want to have a portrait.
    That of Mother, a size 8 canvas, will be ashen grey, against a
    green background, the dress <i>carmine</i>.</p>

    <p>I do not know if it will be like her, but anyhow I want to
    give the impression of a blonde colouring. You will see it one
    day, and if you like, I will make one for you too. It will
    again be in very thick impasto.</p>

    <p>Well, my dear Theo, about your next letter, let me have it
    on Sunday. It will be all right, I venture to think, for we are
    getting very near selling and the stuff I am getting ready now
    will put us in the way of making some show when the exhibition
    is on. It will be a year of hard work, but we shall have good
    times afterward, and even in the meantime I am doing a brothel
    study from memory for Bernard. Did you see that <art id=1413>drawing of mine
    which I put in with Bernard's drawings, representing the house?</art>
    You can get some idea of the colour. I have <art id=0464>a size 30 canvas
    after that drawing</art>.</p>

    <p>With a handshake, and many thanks for the canvas; now for
    the attack, once again. <i>I stick to this</i>, that when these
    decorations that I am working on are finished, they ought to be
    worth ten thousand; whether it is easy for me to do or not,
    that is my fixed and steady aim; we have spent money and we
    must get it back.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
