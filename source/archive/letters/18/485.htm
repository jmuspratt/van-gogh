  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have had to pay my bill provisionally, while stipulating
    on the receipt that this payment was only made so that I could
    regain possession of my belongings, and that the exorbitant
    bill will be submitted to the magistrate.</p>

    <p>But I have almost nothing left after all this: I bought
    things for making the little coffee and soup at home, and two
    chairs and a table. That means that I have exactly 15 francs
    left. So I beg you to send me some more money, in any case not
    later than on your return to Paris.</p>

    <p>I feel sure that I'll soon have several new canvases on the
    easel.</p>

    <p>What I'm sending is packed up and will leave today.</p>

    <p>Only it is discouraging to work hard and to see one's
    subsidy going into the hands of people whom one loathes.</p>

    <p>But we'll put a stop to that. I'll make a permanent studio
    here, where I can put up another painter if necessary.</p>

    <p>Foreigners are exploited here, and from their point of view
    the natives are in the right; they consider it a duty to get
    whatever they can. Right in the country, like McKnight, you pay
    less, but McKnight is getting very dull and has worked very
    little <i>so far</i>. And it is better to work hard and spend
    more, if one must.</p>

    <p>If you would put on one side the best things in what I have
    sent, and consider these pictures as payment to be deducted
    from what I owe you, then, when the day comes when I'll have
    bought you in something like 10,000 francs in this way, I'll
    feel happier.</p>

    <p>The money that has already been spent in other years ought
    to yield some return also, at least in kind.</p>

    <p>I am still far from that.</p>

    <p>But I feel that on these surroundings there is everything
    one needs to do good work. So it will be my own fault if I
    don't succeed. Mauve <i>painted</i> and sold in a single month
    6,000 francs' worth of watercolours, as you told me yourself
    some time ago. Well, there are runs of luck like that, and
    after going through all these worries I feel that it's
    possible.</p>

    <p>In this batch there are <art id=0511>the pink orchard</art> on coarse canvas,
    and <art id=0403>the white orchard</art>, lengthways, and <art id=0571>the bridge</art>. If we keep
    these, I think the price may go up later, and some fifty
    pictures of this quality would compensate us in some measure
    for our very bad luck in the past. Take these three then for
    your own collection, and do not sell them, for they will each
    be worth 500 later on.</p>

    <p>And if we had 50 like these put aside, then I should breathe
    more freely.</p>

    <p>Well, write me soon.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
