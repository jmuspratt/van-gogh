     Letter T3a<br>

    <p>13 November 1888</p>

    <p>Dear Mr. Gauguin,<br>
     It will probably please you to learn that your pictures are
    having a great success. Even before I received my brother's
    letters I had them mounted on adjustable stretchers, and for
    showing the size 30 canvases I have taken a very fine white
    frame of unpainted wood, in which they show up very well. Degas
    is so enthusiastic about your works that he <img width="307"
    height="295" alt="0x08 graphic" src="697_T-G_T3a1.jpg"><br>
     is speaking about them to a lot of people, and he is going to
    buy the canvas representing a spring landscape, with a meadow
    with two female figures in the foreground, the one sitting and
    the other standing.</p>

    <p>Now there are two canvases definitely sold. One is in the
    uptight landscape with two dogs in a meadow, the other one a
    pool by the side of the road. As there is a combination of
    exchange, I am quoting that first one <i>net for you</i> at 375
    francs, and the other one at 225 francs. I could also sell the
    ring of Breton girls, but there will have to be a small
    retouch. The hand of the little girl which almost touches the
    frame acquires an importance it doesn't seem to have when you
    look at the picture as a whole. The would-be buyer wants you to
    revise the shape of that hand a little, but without altering
    anything else whatever in the picture. It seems to me that this
    will not be difficult for you, and so I am sending you the
    canvas. He will give 500 francs for the picture all complete
    with a frame that will cost nearly 100 francs. Please consider
    whether you can comply with his wishes, and whether you want to
    close the bargain.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">For the picture sold recently I have deducted 15 per cent,
    which is the minimum commission the firm takes. Many painters
    accord us 25 per cent. If we can manage to achieve somewhat
    regular sales, I must beg you to do the same, if you are
    willing. In that case it is easier to bring off exchanges or
    sales on credit. Please let me know your opinion on the
    subject.</label></p>

    <p>I was happy to hear that you are getting on well together,
    and that you have been able to start work immediately. I should
    like to be with you two. Is your health improving now?</p>

    <p>A hearty handshake and cordially yours,</p>

    <p>T. van Gogh</p>
