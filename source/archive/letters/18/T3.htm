    <p>Letter T 3<br>
     Paris, 27 October 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I was overjoyed to find your telegram and your letter in
    reply to my first one when I got back from Brussels. I am
    sending you a post office money order; for, although it is
    possible that Gauguin received the letter I addressed to him at
    Pont-Aven, thinking he was still there, there is also the
    possibility that you have not received it, and as you are two
    now it will be harder to have enough to live on than when you
    were alone.<label content="food-and-drink.diet"> Why don't you try to get credit with some purveyor
    of food in case I am not there, as happened a short while ago,
    or if it is impossible for me to send the money at once?</label> I am
    very happy that Gauguin is with you, for I was afraid that he
    had encountered some obstacle which prevented him from coming.
    <label content="health.illness">Now I see from your letter that you are unwell, and that you
    are worrying a good deal.</label> I want to tell you something once and
    for all. I look upon it all as though the question of money and
    the sale of pictures and the whole financial side did not
    exist, or rather existed as a disease.</p>

    <p>As it is certain that money question will not disappear
    before a formidable revolution or probably a series of
    revolutions has come about, it is necessary to treat it like
    smallpox if one has caught it. That is to say, take the
    required precautions against accidents which may result, but
    don't bother your head about it. You have been thinking about
    it far too much lately, and although there may be no symptoms
    of an accident, you are suffering under it. By accidents I mean
    misery, and in order to avoid arriving at this pass, it is
    necessary to take things easy, and not to commit excesses, and
    to try to escape the other diseases as much as possible. You
    speak of money which you owe me, and which you want to give
    back to me. I won't hear of it. The condition I want you to
    arrive at is that you should never have any worries. I must
    work for the money. Seeing that we two together haven't got
    very much, we must see to it that we don't take too much on our
    shoulders, but apart from this consideration we shall be able
    to go on for some time to come, even without selling anything.
    If you very much feel the need of working <i>for yourself</i>,
    go ahead, say the word, and I think that notwithstanding this
    we shall be able to stick it out, but I don't understand the
    calculations of so many pictures at 100 francs apiece.
    <sup>1</sup> If one wants them to be worth 100 francs, they are
    worth nothing at all, for the ignoble society we are living in
    is only on the side of those who do not stand in need of it.
    But knowing this, let's do as society does, and let's say, We
    don't stand in need of it; isn't it true that a warned man
    counts as two? You may do something for me if you like - that
    is, go on as in the past, and create an entourage of artists
    and friends for us, something which I am absolutely incapable
    of doing by my own self, and which <i>you</i> have been able to
    do, more or less, since you came to France. Isn't it true that,
    if the artists show the way, the others will follow suit, if
    the moment should come when we stand in need of it because of
    being unable to continue working as we are now? Personally I am
    firmly convinced of it. You don't know how much pain you give
    me when you say that you have worked so hard that you feel as
    though you had not lived.</p>

    <p>In the first place I don't believe this is true, for in
    point of fact you are living <i>and</i> living like the great
    ones of the earth and the aristocrats. But I beseech you, warn
    me in time, in order that you may not feel that you have been
    living in misery, and that you have fallen ill because you
    lacked a piece of bread to keep alive. I hope Gauguin's company
    will be pleasant for you, and that you will recover within a
    very short time.</p>

    <p>I have not received the canvases yet. Did he send them off,
    or shall I get them through the agency of somebody else? At
    Brussels I made the acquaintance of De Groux's son, who is also
    an artist. Unfortunately it was on the last night of my stay
    there, so that I could not take a look at what he does. The
    movement in art we are having here seems to be zealously
    discussed but also approved of over there, and it would be a
    good thing to organize a permanent exhibition at Brussels, too.
    De Haan is coming tomorrow to stay with me, which I am very
    glad of; I am very curious to know what he is going to do, for
    he is anxious to start working at once. Enclosed you will find
    a letter from our mother, which she requested me to forward to
    you.<label content="art.supplies"> Tasset will send you the paints and the canvas
    shortly.</label></p>

    <p>I hope to see you soon, and a cordial handshake to
    Gauguin.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>
