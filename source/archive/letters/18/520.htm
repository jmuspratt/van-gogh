    <p>Letter 520<br>
     Arles, 11 August 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Shortly you are going to make the acquaintance of Mr.
    Patience Escalier, a sort of man with a hoe, former drover of
    the Camargue, now gardener at a farm in the Crau. Today I am
    sending you <art id=1460>the drawing I made</art> after <art id=0443>this painting</art>, as
    well as the drawing of the <art id=1458>portrait of the postman Rollin [sic]</art>. The colouring
    of this portrait of the peasant is less black than the potato eaters of Nuenen, but our highly
    civilized Parisian <i>Portier</i> - probably so called because he chucks pictures
    out - will be bothered by the same old problem. You have
    changed since then, but you still see that he has not, and it
    really is a pity that there are not more paintings <i>en
    sabots</i> in Paris. I don't think that my peasant would do
    harm to the Lautrec that you have and I even dare say that the
    Lautrec would become even more distinguished by the mutual
    contrast, and that my own would gain by the odd comparison,
    because the sunlit and sunburned quality of the huge sun and
    the open air would show to advantage beside <art id=lautrec340>the rice powder and
    the chic dressing table</art> <sup>1</sup>.</p>

    <p>What a mistake Parisians make in not having a palate for
    crude things, for Monticellis, for common earthenware. But
    there, one most not lose heart because Utopia is not coming
    true. It is only that what I learned in Paris is leaving me,
    and I am returning to the ideas I had in the country before I
    knew the impressionists. And I should not be surprised if the
    impressionists soon find fault with my way of working, for it
    has been fertilized by Delacroix's ideas rather than by theirs.
    Because instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I have
    before my eyes, I use colour more arbitrarily, in order to
    express myself forcibly. Well, let that be, as far as theory
    goes, but I'm going to give you an example of what I mean.</p>

    <p>I should like to paint the portrait of an artist friend, a
    man who dreams great dreams, who works as the nightingale
    sings, because it is his nature. He'll be a blond man. I want
    to put my appreciation, the love I have for him into the
    picture. So I paint him as he is, as faithfully as I can, to
    begin with.</p>

    <p>But <art id=0462>the picture</art> is not yet finished. To finish it I am now
    going to be the arbitrary colourist. I exaggerate the fairness
    of the hair, I even get to orange tones, chromes and pale
    citron-yellow.</p>

    <p>Behind the head, instead of painting the ordinary wall of
    the mean room, I paint infinity, a plain background of the
    richest, intensest blue that I can contrive, and by this simple
    combination of the bright head against the rich blue
    background, I get a mysterious effect, like a star in the
    depths of an azure sky.</p>

    <p>Similarly in the portrait of the peasant I have worked this
    way, but in this case without wishing to evoke the mysterious
    brilliance of a pale star in the infinite blue. But imagine the
    terrible man that I have to do in the full furnace of the
    harvest at high noon. Hence the flashing orange colours like a
    red-hot fire, hence the tones of old gold luminous in the
    gloom.</p>

    <p>Ah, my dear boy - - and the good folk will not see in this
    exaggeration anything but a caricature.</p>

    <p>But what has that to do with us? We've read La Terre and
    Germinal, and if we are painting a peasant, we want to show
    that in the end what we have read has come very near to being
    part of us.</p>

    <p>I do not know if I can paint the postman <i>as I feel
    him</i>; this man is like old Tanguy in so far as he is a
    revolutionary, he is probably thought a good republican because
    he wholeheartedly detests the republic which we now enjoy, and
    because on the whole he is beginning to doubt, to be a little
    disillusioned, as to the republican principle itself.</p>

    <p>But I once watched him sing the &ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo;
    and I thought I was watching `89, not next year, but the old 99
    years ago. It was a Delacroix, a Daumier, straight from the old
    Dutchmen.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately he cannot pose, and yet to make a picture you
    must have an intelligent model.</p>

    <p>And now I must tell you that these days, as far as material
    things go, are cruelly hard. Life, no matter what I do, is
    pretty expensive here, almost like Paris, where you can spend 5
    or 6 francs a day and have very little to show for it.</p>

    <p>If I have models, I suffer a good deal for it. But it
    doesn't matter, and I'm going to continue. And I can assure you
    that if you should happen to send me a little extra money
    sometimes, it would benefit the pictures, but not me. The only
    choice I have is between being a good painter and a bad one. I
    choose the first. But the needs of the painting are like those
    of a wasteful mistress, you can do nothing without money, and
    you never have enough of it. That's why painting ought to be
    done at the public expense, instead of the artists being
    overburdened with it.</p>

    <p>But there, we had better hold our tongues, because <i>no one
    is forcing us to work</i>, fate having ordained that
    indifference to painting be widespread and by way of being
    eternal.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">Fortunately my digestion is so nearly all right
    again that I have lived for three weeks in the month on ship's biscuits with
    milk and eggs. </label>It is the blessed warmth that is bringing back
    my strength, and I was certainly right in <i>going at once</i>
    to the South, instead of waiting until the evil was past
    remedy. Yes, really, <label content="health.general">I am as well as other men now, which I
    have never been except for a short while in Nuenen for
    instance, and it is rather pleasant. By other men I mean
    something like the navvies, old Tanguy, old Millet, the
    peasants. When you are well, you must be able to live on a
    piece of bread while you are working all day, and have enough
    strength to smoke and to drink your glass in the evening,
    that's necessary under the circumstances.</label> And all the same to
    feel the stars and the infinite high and clear above you. Then
    life is almost enchanted after all. Oh! those who don't believe
    in this sun here are real infidels.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, along with the good god sun three quarters of
    the time there is the devil mistral.</p>

    <p>Saturday's post has gone, damn it, and I never doubted but I
    should get your letter. However, you see I am not fretting
    about it.</p>

    <p>With a handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
