    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You will have got my wire telling you that 2<sup>nd</sup>
    lieutenant Milliet will arrive in Paris on Friday morning; he
    will arrive at the Gare de Lyon at 5:15 in the morning and go
    from there straight to the Cercle Militaire in the Avenue de
    l'Op&eacute;ra. It would be simplest for both of you if you
    went to see him there at 7 o'clock sharp in the morning.</p>

    <p>Of course you could also meet him at the Gare de Lyon
    itself, but to begin with that is farther off, and then you
    would have to get up very early. He has been very nice to me,
    particularly these last few days. He will return to Paris for a
    week, but he is spending the greater part of his leave in the
    North.</p>

    <p>I am very glad to have these pictures sent off, and in this
    way our sister will see my studies, and that makes a difference
    to me, for by this she will share in something that is
    essentially part of our life in France, crude and casual as it
    may be. I mean, she will see painting in the raw. But to do me
    a great favour, show her one or two studies put on stretchers
    and framed in white. You can take some of the earlier ones out
    of their stretchers and frames. Don't let my stuff take up too
    much room, so don't get encumbered with stretchers and frames
    for my sake. For the comrades will see well enough what it is
    like just as it stands, and you even more. Later on - when the
    hundred are done - we will choose ten or fifteen of them to be
    framed. I have kept <art id=0432>the big portrait of the postman</art>, and <art id=0433>the
    head which I included was done at a <i>single sitting</i>.</art></p>

    <p>But that's what I'm good at, doing a fellow roughly in one
    sitting. If I wanted to show off, my boy, I'd always do it,
    drink with the first comer, paint him, and that not in water
    colours but in oils, on the spot in the manner of Daumier.</p>

    <p>If I did a hundred like that, there would be some good ones
    among them. And I'd be more of a Frenchman and more myself, and
    more of a drinker. It does tempt me so - not drinking, but
    painting tramps. What I gained by it as an artist, should I
    lose that as a man? <label content="health.mental">If I had the faith to do it, I'd be a
    notable madman; now I am an insignificant one, but you see I am
    not sufficiently ambitious for that fame to set a match to the
    powder.</label> I would rather wait for the next generation, which will
    do in portraiture what Claude Monet does in landscape, the
    rich, daring landscape &agrave; la Guy de Maupassant.</p>

    <p>But then I know that I am not - not their equal - but didn't
    the Flauberts and Balzacs make the Zolas and Maupassants? So
    here's to - not us, but to the generation to come. You are a
    good enough judge of painting to see and understand what I may
    have of originality, and also to see the uselessness of
    presenting what I am doing to the modern public, because the
    others surpass me in clearness of touch. That is more the fault
    of wind and circumstances, compared to what I could do without
    the mistral and without the fatal conditions of vanished youth
    and comparative poverty. For my part I am in no way set on
    changing my condition, and I count myself only too happy to be
    able to go on as I do.</p>

    <p>No answer from friend Russell, and Gauguin certainly
    deserved one.</p>

    <p>I have put in this package <art id=1462>a drawing</art> after
    <art id=0449>a picture which I am working on now - the boats with the man
    unloading sand</art>. If some studies are not quite dry, so much the
    worse for them.<label content="art.technique"> They must be left to dry out, then washed with
    plenty of water, and retouched if necessary.</label> But they cannot
    come to much harm, and it was a good opportunity for sending
    them.</p>

    <p>A good handshake, and I do hope to hear from you by Friday
    or Saturday.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
