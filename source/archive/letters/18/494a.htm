  <body>
    <p>My dear comrade Gauguin,</p>

    <p>I have thought of you very often, and the reason why I did
    not write sooner is that I did not want to write empty phrases.
    The deal with Russell has not come off yet, but for all that
    Russell has bought some impressionists, e.g. Guillaumin and
    Bernard, so bide your time - he will come to it of his own
    accord, but after two refusals I could not possibly insist any
    longer, as the refusals also contained a promise for the
    future.</p>

    <p>I wanted to let you know that I have just rented a four-room
    house here in Arles.</p>

    <p>And that it would seem to me that if I could find another
    painter inclined to work in the South, and who, like myself,
    would be sufficiently absorbed in his work to be able to resign
    himself to living like a monk who goes to the brothel once a
    fortnight - who for the rest is tied up in his work, and not
    very willing to waste his time, it might be a good job.<label content="feelings.loneliness"> Being
    all alone, I am suffering a little under this isolation.</label></p>

    <p>So I have often thought of telling you so frankly.</p>

    <p>You know that my brother and I greatly appreciate your
    painting, and that we are most anxious to see you quietly
    settled down.</p>

    <p>Now the fact is that my brother cannot send you money in
    Brittany and at the same time send me money in Provence. But
    are you willing to share with me here? If we combine, there may
    be enough for both of us, I am sure of it, in fact. Once having
    attacked the South, I don't see any reason to drop it.</p>

    <p>I was ill when I came here, but now I am feeling better, and
    as a matter of fact, I am greatly attracted by the South, where
    working out-of-doors is possible nearly all the year round.</p>

    <p>However, it seems to me that life is more expensive here,
    but on the other hand the chances of getting more pictures done
    are better.<label content="business.selling"> However this may be, if my brother were to send 250
    francs a month for both of us, we might share, should you care
    to come. Only in this case it would be necessary to have our
    meals at home as much as possible; we might engage some kind of
    charwoman for a few hours a day, so as to avoid all the expense
    of going to an inn.</p>

    <p>And you would give my brother one picture a month; you could
    do what you like with the rest of your work.<label></p>

    <p>Well, the two of us would immediately start exhibiting at
    Marseilles, thus clearing the way for other impressionists as
    much as for ourselves. You must not forget that now there would
    be the cost of moving and of buying a bed, which would also
    have to be paid for in pictures.</p>

    <p>Of course you are free to exchange views with my brother
    about this business, however I must warn you that in all
    probability he will decline responsibility for it. He will only
    assure you that up to the present the only means we have found
    of coming to your aid in a more practical way is this
    combining, if it should appeal to you. We have thought it over
    carefully. It seems to me that what your health requires above
    all is quiet. If I should be mistaken, and if the heat of the
    South should be too strong for you - well, then we must try to
    find another solution. As for myself, I am feeling quite well
    in this climate. I want to tell you a great many other things -
    but business must come first. Send us both your answer at your
    earliest convenience.</p>
