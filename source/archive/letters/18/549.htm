    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>A letter from Gauguin, paying me heaps of undeserved
    compliments, and adding that he will not be coming till the end
    of the month.</p>

    <p>And that he has been ill, and dreads the journey. What can I
    do about it&hellip;but after all, when you come to think of it,
    is it such a devastating journey when the worst lung cases
    undertake it?</p>

    <p>When he comes, he will be welcome. If he does not come,
    well, it's his own lookout; but isn't it or oughtn't it to be
    clear that he is coming here for the very purpose of getting
    better?</p>

    <p>And he asserts that he has to stay where he is to recover!
    The absurdity of it, really.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your postal order for 20 francs. I put 35 francs
    for the dressing table and chest of drawers on my list of
    necessary purchases. Well now, I have just bought one at 14
    francs, and paid for it, of course.</p>

    <p><i>Send me an order for those 14 francs, I beg you</i>.</p>

    <p>I felt less hesitant about getting this piece of furniture
    because I want to be ready in case Gauguin should come
    sooner.</p>

    <p>I enclose a copy of my answer to his rather too
    complimentary letter. Since he is not coming at once,
    <i>I want all the more to try to have everything in good order,
    and in readiness for him when he does come</i>. I have done a
    new size 30 canvas, and I expect to begin a new one this
    evening, <i>when the gas is lit</i>.</p>

    <p>The one I have just done is another garden.</p>

    <p>These days I always have the feeling that I am spending
    money, but every day too it astonishes me to find how I get it
    back from the house. Truly, it does you good to come home, and
    it gives you new ideas for work. Gauguin writes very nicely,
    but all the same he does not say why he is not coming at once.
    He says - &ldquo;because he is ill,&rdquo; but wasn't he coming
    here to recover? I thought that was precisely what we had in
    mind.</p>

    <p>Anyway - <i>let them do just as they please</i>.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Reply to Gauguin's letter]</p>

    <p>My dear Gauguin,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter - far too flattering to me. So you
    are not coming till the end of the month.</p>

    <p>Very good - since you really think that you will get better
    more quickly in Brittany than here.</p>

    <p>I don't insist on it, only if your recovery is not very
    speedy in Brittany, remember that <i>we</i> claim to be able to
    cure you more quickly here than there. Come, everything is
    always for the best in this best of worlds, in which we have -
    according to good old Pangloss anyhow - the ineffable happiness
    of living. In this case I have no doubt at all that everything
    will be for the best. But is it absolutely true that the
    journey to Arles is as exhausting as you say? Nonsense, since
    the worst lung cases make it. You well know that the P. L.
    M.<sup>1</sup> exists for that.</p>

    <p>Or are you more seriously ill than you say? I am afraid so,
    and if you can, either reassure me on this point, or else write
    definitely that you are ill and in a bad way. But you write
    about business, and talk about lithographs. This is what I
    think:</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">For you, me, Bernard and Laval to make lithographs at night
    is <i>all right</i> - I am sure of that, but I am <i>not
    sure</i> about their periodical publication so long as I am not
    better off. I have more than enough worry with the painting.
    There is always something to spend money on in lithography
    <i>even if you do not buy</i> the stone. That would not cost so
    very much - I do not say that - but then for publishing,
    however modestly, the four of us would be in for at least 50
    francs <i>each</i>. <i>And more besides</i>&hellip;</label></p>

    <p>Contradict me if you like, I don't insist on it, but still I
    say what I say. I have already had some experience with one
    attempt, but the &ldquo;besides&rdquo; that I add means that it
    would not last, and above all would never interest the public.
    And it will go on costing us money.</p>

    <p>Even if it did cost us money, I am actually all for
    <i>making</i> the lithographs in question. But as for
    <i>publication</i>, on the other hand, even <i>free of cost</i>
    - never.</p>

    <p>If it is at our expense and for our own pleasure and use,
    then I tell you again, I am for it. If you are thinking of
    something else, I am not for it; do not tell me that one costs
    as little as the other if it's a question of publishing.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>And do come as soon as you possibly can!</p>

    <p>P.S. to Gauguin. If you are not ill, do please come at once.
    If you are too ill, a wire and a letter, please.</p>

    <p>P.S. to Theo. Perhaps you will think the P.S. to Gauguin too
    curt, but let him say whether or not he is ill, and anyhow he
    will recover better here. Have you received my canvases???</p>
