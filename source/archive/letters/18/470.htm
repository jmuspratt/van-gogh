    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Here is a short note for Bernard and for Lautrec, to whom I expressly
    promised to write. I send them to you so you can hand
    them over when you have a chance, but there is absolutely no hurry
    whatever, and it will be an excuse for you to see what they are
    doing and hear what they have to say, if you want to.</p>

    <p>But what is Tersteeg doing? Nothing? If you have had no
    reply, if I were you I should write him a very short and
    very cool note, but conveying that you are amazed at not getting a
    reply from him. (+)</p>

    <p>I do not think that we should press him in a fresh letter,
    explaining the business all over again. One must be careful
    when dealing with him, but what must be avoided is letting
    oneself be treated as if one were dead or outlawed. That's
    all.</p>

    <p>Let's hope that meanwhile you have had an answer from
    him.</p>

    <p>I had a note from Gauguin, who complains about the bad
    weather, is still ailing, and says that of all the various
    miseries that afflict humanity, nothing maddens him more than
    the lack of money, and yet he feels doomed to perpetual
    poverty.</p>

    <p>Wind and rain these last few days. I've worked at home on
    <art id=0544>the study which I made a sketch of in Bernard's letter [B2]. I wanted
    to manage to get colours into it like stained glass windows,
    and a good, firm drawing</art>.</p>

    <p>I am in the middle of Pierre et Jean by Guy de Maupassant.
    It's good. Have you read the preface, where he explains the
    artist's liberty to exaggerate, to create in his novel a world
    more beautiful, more simple, more consoling than ours, and goes
    on to explain what Flaubert may have meant when he said that
    &ldquo;Talent is long patience, and originality an effort of
    will and of intense observation&rdquo;?</p>

    <p>There is a Gothic portico here, which I am beginning to
    think admirable, the porch of St. Trophime.</p>

    <p>But it is so cruel, so monstrous, like a Chinese nightmare,
    that even this beautiful monument of so grand a style seems to
    me of another world, and I am as glad not to belong
    to it as to that glorious world of the
    Roman Nero.</p>

    <p>Must I tell the truth and add that the Zouaves, the
    brothels, the adorable little Arl&eacute;siennes going to their
    first Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a
    dangerous rhinoceros, the absinthe drinkers, all seem to
    me to be beings of another world? That doesn't mean that
    I'd feel at home in an artistic world, but that I would rather
    fool myself than feel alone. And I think I should feel
    depressed if I did not fool myself about everything.</p>

    <p>You have already had heavy snow in Paris according to our
    friend L'Intransigeant. It wasn't a bad idea, that journalist
    advising General Boulanger to wear rose-coloured spectacles, so
    as to put the secret police on the wrong scent: according to
    him they'd match his beard better. It might have a favourable
    influence on the picture trade - it's been wanted for long
    enough.</p>

    <p>But we really must get some idea of what our excellent Mr.
    Tersteeg is up to. He must declare himself! In the
    interest of our comrades it seems to me it's almost our business not to
    allow them to think of us as dead. It is not about us, but the
    whole question of the impressionists is at stake, and having
    been challenged by us, he must give us an answer.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">Like myself you will feel that we cannot proceed without
    being categorically informed of his intentions.</p>

    <p>If we consider it desirable to hold a permanent exhibition
    of the impressionists in London and Marseilles, it goes without
    saying that we'll try to set them up.</p>

    <p>And if not, what are his intentions with regard to the
    offensive, do they exist or not?</p>

    <p>The question remains, will Tersteeg be in it? Yes or no?</label></p>

    <p>And has he taken into account, as we have, the resulting
    depreciation of the value of pictures now highly priced, a
    depreciation that will, I think, probably set in as soon as the
    impressionist's stock rises. You observe that the dealers in
    expensive pictures ruin themselves by opposing for policy
    reasons the advent of a school which for years has shown an
    energy and perseverance worthy of Millet, Daubigny and
    others.</p>

    <p>But let me know if Tersteeg has written you, and what he may
    have said. <i>I will do nothing in this without you.</i> Good luck and
    a handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I enclose Gauguin's letter with the others so that you can
    read all of them.</p>

    <p>[Footnote added to the bottom of page 1:]</p>


    <p>(+) I say to write yourself, because even though he
    doesn't answer me, <i>he must</i> answer you, and you must
    insist on a reply or else you will lose you assurance with him, and on
    the contrary this is an excellent opportunity for improving
    it.</p>
