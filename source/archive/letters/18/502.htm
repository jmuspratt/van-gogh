  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter, and the 50-Fr note enclosed. I
    did not know that the article on Claude Monet was by the same
    person as the one on Bismarck. It does one good to read things
    like that, more than most of the stuff the decadents write,
    with their passion for saying the most obvious things in the
    most wildly contorted phrases.</p>

    <p>I am very dissatisfied with what I have been doing lately,
    because it is very ugly. But all the same, figure is
    interesting me more than landscape.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I shall send you <art id=1443>a drawing of the Zouave</art> today. In
    the end making studies of figures so as to experiment and to
    learn will be the shortest way for me to do something worth
    while.</p>

    <p>Bernard has got to the point. Today he sent me a rough
    sketch of a brothel, which I am sending you enclosed to hang
    beside his clowns, which you already have. There is a poem on
    the back of the drawing, in just the same tone as the drawing;
    probably he has a more finished painted study of it.</p>

    <p>I should not be surprised if he wanted to make an exchange
    with me for <art id=0423>the Zouave's head</art>, though it is very ugly. But as I
    do not want to deprive him of studies which he can sell, I will
    not suggest an exchange unless we could buy something from him
    for a small sum at the same time.</p>

    <p>It is still raining heavily here, which is doing a great
    deal of harm to the wheat that is still standing.</p>

    <p>But fortunately I have a model these days.</p>

    <p>I am in need of a book - the A B C D of Drawing, by A.
    Cassagne. I asked for it at the bookshop here, and after
    waiting a fortnight, they told me that they must have the name
    of the publisher, which I do not know. I'd be very grateful if
    you could send it to me.<label content="attitude.people"> The carelessness, the lazy
    happy-go-lucky ways of the people here are beyond belief; you
    have trouble getting the most trifling things.</label> That is why I'll
    have to go to Marseilles someday, to get what I want there. The
    cost of carriage from Paris is no joke and runs up the price of
    things, but to have to run one's errands in Marseilles makes
    them even more expensive.</p>

    <p>What often vexes me is that painting is like having a bad
    mistress who spends and spends and it's never enough, and I
    tell myself that even if a tolerable study comes out of it from
    time to time, it would have been much cheaper to buy it from
    somebody else.</p>

    <p>The other thing, the hope of doing better, is rather a fata
    morgana too. But there is no quick remedy for all this, unless
    sometime or another you can join hands with a good worker, and
    produce more together.</p>

    <p>As for the publisher of Cassagne's book - surely you have
    his treatise on perspective, and the address must be in it;
    besides they keep those books at Lalouche and Rue's in the
    Chauss&eacute;e d'Antin, that place that always has the
    continuations of the various series.</p>

    <p>It is great that Claude Monet managed to paint those ten
    pictures between February and May. Quick work doesn't mean less
    serious work, it depends on one's self-confidence and
    experience. In the same way Jules Gu&eacute;rard, the lion
    hunter, says in his book that in the beginning young lions have
    a lot of trouble killing a horse or an ox, but that the old
    lions kill with a single blow of the paw or a well-placed bite,
    and that they are amazingly sure at the job.</p>

    <p>I see nothing here of the Southern gaiety that Daudet talks
    about so much, but on the contrary, all kinds of insipid airs
    and graces, a sordid carelessness. But the country is beautiful
    in spite of it.</p>

    <p>Nature here however must be very different from what it is
    at Bordighera, Hy&egrave;res, Geneva, or Antibes, where there
    is less mistral and where the mountains have an entirely
    different character. Here, except for an intenser colouring, it
    reminds one of Holland: everything is flat, only one thinks
    rather of the Holland of Ruysdael or Hobbema or Ostade than of
    Holland as it is.</p>

    <p>What surprises me is the scarcity of flowers; there are no
    cornflowers in the wheat, and seldom poppies.</p>

    <p>What was the cost of the carriage on that last case of
    pictures? The impasto on some of the canvases is dry on the
    surface, but not enough to be rolled, or else I would send
    them.</p>

    <p>McKnight has a friend with him now, I never see any of his
    work. Yesterday I showed four or five new studies to him and
    his friend; they looked at them in frosty silence. I think they
    are preparing a surprise on their own account, and I hope it
    will be good, because it would give me great pleasure to see
    what they have found their way.</p>

    <p>A handshake for you and Mourier if he is not already
    installed in the studio &agrave; la G&eacute;r&ocirc;me.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
