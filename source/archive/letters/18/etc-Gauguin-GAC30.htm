    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I have just read your interesting letter and I quite agree with you
    on how little importance exactness is in art.   </p>

    <p>Art is an abstraction, unfortunately one becomes more and more misunderstood.
    I would really like that we reach our goal: that is to say my journey to
    Provence. I always had the fancy to interpret the bullfights in my own way,
    as I understand them. I am starting to get the freedom of my faculties: my
    illness had weakened me and in my last studies I think that what I have done
    up to now is out of date.  </p>

    <p>Naturally this band of pigs here find me quite mad, and I that rather
    pleases me because it proves to me that I am not. I have just finished a
    <art id=wrestlerp>Breton fight </art>that you will like, I am sure. </p>

    <p>[<art id=wrestlersk>Gauguin drew a sketch of the Young Breton Wrestlers here.</art>]</p>

    <p>Two kids blue pants and vermilion pants. One at the top to the right is
    coming out of the water.</p>

    <p>Green lawn / pure emerald [veronéze] going down to chromium yellow without
    execution as in Japanese crepons.</p>

    <p>At the top a boiling cascade of water, pink-white and a rainbow on the
    side close to the frame.</p>

    <p>At the bottom a white touch, a black hat and blue shirt.</p>

    <p>About Russell. Granchi said to me that he had seen him 2 months ago in
    Paris and that Russell had great admiration for me and that he had gone to
    Belle Isle.</p>

    <p>I really don't understand why a rich man wouldn’t buy what he admires. Let’s still hope.</p>

    <p>Who is this Thomas you mentioned, is he Thomas de Bojano? Or is he the dealer
    who lives close to place Vendôme?</p>

    <p>My friend Laval came back from Martinique; he bought back some very curious
    watercolours. I want to make you to see that what you love is art. I talk as if
    we were already together. I must tell you that once I make a resolution I am
    always in a hurry to put it to execution.</p>

    <p>If it weren’t for this filthy money my trunks would soon be packed. I don't
    know why, but for about ten days I have painted a lot of madness in my head that
    I intend to execute in the Midi: I believe that is because of my state of health,
    which is flourishing again. I have a need of struggle; to carve with a club. After
    all the research that I have just done here I believe it will help me to go better
    than before.</p>

    <p>Until we are together, an affectionate handshake,</p>

    <p>Paul Gauguin. </p>
