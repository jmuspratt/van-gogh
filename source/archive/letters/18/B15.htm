  <body>
    <p>My dear Bernard,</p>

    <p>I want to do figures, figures and more figures. I cannot
    resist that series of bipeds from the baby to Socrates, and
    from the woman with black hair and white skin to the woman with
    yellow hair and a sunburned brick-red face.</p>

    <p>In the meantime I am mostly doing other things.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter. <label content="health.fatigue">This time I am writing in a great
    hurry and greatly exhausted.</label></p>

    <p>I am very pleased you have joined Gauguin.</p>

    <p>Ah! I have another figure all the same which is an absolute
    continuation of certain studies of heads I did in Holland. I
    showed them to you one day along with <art id=0082>a picture from that
    period, &ldquo;The Potato Eaters&rdquo;;</art> I wish I could show
    you this one. It is still a study, in which colour plays a part
    such as the black and white of a drawing could not possibly
    reproduce.</p>

    <p>I wanted to send you a very large and very careful drawing.
    Very well! It turned out quite different, though it is correct.
    For this time again <art id=0443>the colour suggests a blazing air of
    harvest time right in the South, in the middle of the dog days,
    and without that it's another picture.</art></p>

    <p>I dare believe that Gauguin and you would understand it; but
    how ugly people will think it! <i>You</i> know what a peasant
    is, how strongly he reminds one of a wild beast, when you have
    found one of the true race.</p>

    <p>I also have<art id=0449> &ldquo;Men Unloading a Sand Barge&rdquo; - that
    is to say, there are two boats of a violet-kind of pink in
    veronese green water [loaded] with grey sand, wheelbarrows,
    planks and a little blue-and-yellow fellow</art>.</p>

    <p>All of it seen from the quay above it, looking down at a
    bird's-eye view. No sky; it is only an attempt or rather a
    quick study, done during the full violence of the mistral.</p>

    <p>I am also attempting dusty thistles with a great swarm of
    butterflies whirling over them [Unknown painting].</p>

    <p>Oh! that beautiful midsummer sun here. It beats down on
    one's head, and I haven't the slightest doubt that it makes one
    crazy. But as I was so to begin with, I only enjoy it.</p>

    <p>I am thinking of decorating my studio with half a dozen
    pictures of &ldquo;Sunflowers,&rdquo; a decoration in which the
    raw or broken chrome yellows will blaze forth on various
    backgrounds - blue, from the palest malachite green to <i>royal
    blue</i>, framed in thin strips of wood painted with orange
    lead.</p>

    <p>Effects like those of stained-glass windows in a Gothic
    church.</p>

    <p>Ah! my dear comrades, let us crazy ones take delight in our
    eyesight in spite of everything, yes, let's!</p>

    <p>Alas, nature takes it out of the animal, and our bodies are
    despicable and sometimes a heavy burden. But it has been like
    that ever since Giotto, that man with his poor health.</p>

    <p>Ah! and what a feast for the eyes all the same, and what a
    smile of the old lion Rembrandt, with a piece of white cloth
    around his head, his palette in his hand!</p>

    <p>How much I would like to spend these days in Pont-Aven;
    however, I find comfort in contemplating the sunflowers.</p>

    <p>A hearty handshake, till soon again.</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Vincent</p>
