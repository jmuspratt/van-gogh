  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for the money order for 50 francs, which I received
    just now.</p>

    <p>I knew well that Gauguin had made sea voyages, but I did not
    know that he was a regular mariner. He has passed through all
    the difficulties, and has been a real able seaman and a true
    sailor. This gives me an awful respect for him and a still more
    absolute confidence in his personality. He has, if one must
    compare him with anything, an affinity with that
    <i>P&ecirc;cheur d'Islande</i> [Icelandic Fisherman] by Loti. I
    think this will make the same impression on you as on me.</p>

    <p>Now we have already worked of course. He is busy with a
    Negress and a large landscape of this region.</p>

    <p>What he tells me about Brittany is very interesting, and
    Pont-Aven is a most marvellous country. Certainly everything
    there is better, larger, more beautiful than here. It has a
    more solemn character, and especially purer in its totality and
    more definite than the shrivelled, scorched, trivial scenery of
    Provence. Never mind, all the same he, as I myself, likes what
    he sees, and above all things he is intrigued by the
    Arl&eacute;siennes.</p>

    <p>This week I made <art id=0494>a new study of a sower,
    the landscape quite flat, the figure small and vague.</art></p>

    <p>Further I have made another <art id=0573>study of a ploughed field with
    the stump of an old yew tree</art>. Like this.</p>

    <p>[See <art id=692_V-T_558b0>reproduction of the page.</art>]</p>

    <p>And that's all. How are you, and have you done anything in
    Brussels?</p>

    <p><label content="health.fatigue">My brain is still feeling tired and dried up, but this week
    I am feeling better than during the previous fortnight.</label></p>

    <p>What Gauguin tells of the tropics seems marvellous to me.
    Surely the future of a great renaissance in painting lies
    there. Just ask your new Dutch friends whether they have ever
    thought how interesting it would be if some Dutch painters were
    to found a colourist school in Java. If they heard Gauguin
    describe the tropical countries, it would certainly make them
    desire to do it directly. Everybody is not free and [in]
    circumstances [that allow them] to emigrate. But what things
    could be done there!</p>

    <p>I regret I am not ten or twenty years younger, then I would
    certainly go there.</p>

    <p>Now it is most unlikely that I shall leave the shore and put
    to sea, and the little yellow house here in Arles will remain a
    way station between Africa, the Tropics, and the people of the
    North.</p>

    <p>At present it is rather probable that Bernard will go to
    Africa, where he will meet Milliet, who gives you his regards
    and will leave on November 1.</p>

    <p>I like the look of the studio, especially in the evening,
    with the gas burning.</p>

    <p>If you should come across more Daumiers, don't forget to
    grab hold of them.</p>

    <p>And I think that in the evening we will bring along
    neighbours and friends, and, while chatting away, we will work
    in the evening as in the daytime.</p>

    <p>Portraits of people in the light of a gas lamp, it certainly
    seems to me it can be done.</p>

    <p>I shake your hand well and write to us soon</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
