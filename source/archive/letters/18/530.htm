  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>A hasty note to thank you tremendously for the prompt
    dispatch of your letter. As it happened my good fellow had
    already arrived that morning very early for his rent. I had of
    course to commit myself today as to whether or not I would keep
    the house (because I have rented it till Michaelmas, and one
    has to renew or cancel the agreement in advance). I told my
    good fellow that I would take it again for three months only or
    else by the month again. So supposing friend Gauguin comes and
    does not like it, we shall not have a very long lease on our
    hands.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.apprehension">My heart often despairs when I think of what Gauguin will
    say about the country in the end. The isolation of this place
    is pretty serious, and all the time you have to hack each step
    in the ice as you go from one day's work to the next. Then
    there is the difficulty with the models, but patience and above
    all a few pennies ready in your pocket will naturally get you
    somewhere. But it is a real difficulty.</label></p>

    <p>I feel that even so late in the day I could be a very
    different painter if I were capable of getting my own way with
    the models, but I also feel the possibility of going to seed
    and of seeing the day of one's capacity for artistic creation
    pass, just as a man loses his virility in the course of his
    life.</p>

    <p>That is inevitable, and naturally in this as in the other,
    the one thing to do is to be of good heart and strike while the
    iron is hot.</p>

    <p>And I often get downhearted. But Gauguin and so many others
    are in exactly the same position, and above all we must seek
    the remedy within ourselves, in good will and patience, and at
    the same time struggle to be something more than mediocrities.
    Perhaps we shall be preparing a new road while we do this.</p>

    <p>I am very curious to get your next letter giving a fuller
    account of your visit to Bing. I am not surprised at what you
    say, that after our sister went away you felt a void. You must
    try to fill it. And what is there to prevent Gauguin's coming
    to stay with you? In this way he could get his heart's desire
    of Paris, and work at the same time.</p>

    <p>Only in that case it would only be fair for him to pay back
    the equivalent of what you would be doing for him in pictures.
    It is a constant grief to me that comparatively I can do so
    little with the money I spend.</p>

    <p>My life is disturbed and restless, but then if I make a
    change and move about much, I shall perhaps only make things
    worse.</p>

    <p>It is a terrible handicap for me that I don't speak the
    Proven&ccedil;al patois.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I keep thinking seriously of using coarser colours, which
    will not be any less sound for being less brayed.</p>

    <p>Often now I hesitate before planning a picture because of
    what the colours would cost us.</label> You see all the same this is
    rather a pity, for the simple reason that we may have the power
    to work today, but we do not know if it will hold out till
    tomorrow.</p>

    <p>All the same, far from losing my physical strength, I am
    regaining it, and <label subject="health.gastrointestinal.stomach">my stomach especially is
    stronger.</label></p>

    <p>I am sending you three volumes of Balzac today. He is really
    a bit out of date, etc., but like the Daumiers and the Lemuds,
    none the worse for belonging to a period which is over.</p>

    <p>At the moment I am reading Daudet's L'Immortel, which I find
    <i>very beautiful</i>, but not particularly heartening. I think
    I shall have to read a book on elephant hunting, or of absolute
    lies about adventures which are categorically impossible, like
    Gustave Aimard for instance, to get rid of the heartbreak that
    L'Immortel is going to leave me with. It is exactly because it
    is so beautiful and so true that it makes you feel the
    emptiness of the civilized world. I must say though that I
    prefer his Tartarin for real power.</p>

    <p>Many regards to our sister, and thank you again for your
    letter.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
