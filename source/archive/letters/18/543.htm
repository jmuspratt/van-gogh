  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo, thank you very much of your letter and the 50
    francs note that it contained. <label content="Theo.health">It is not good that the pains in
    the leg have come back</label> - my god - it would be good it if it was
    possible if you could live in the Midi too, because I always
    think that we need each other, and the sun and good weather and
    the blue air are the strongest remedy. The weather here remains
    beautiful, and if it is always like this then it would be
    better than the paradise of those painters who are in Japan
    itself. I think about you and Gauguin and about Bernard all the
    time and everywhere. It is so beautiful and I would so like to
    see everybody here.</p>

    <p>Included <art id=1515>a small sketch</art> of a 30 square
    canvas - in short <art id=0474>the starry sky painted by night, actually
    under a gas jet</art>. The sky is aquamarine, the water is royal
    blue, the ground is mauve. The town is blue and purple. The gas
    is yellow and the reflections are russet gold descending down
    to green-bronze. On the aquamarine field of the sky the Great
    Bear is a sparkling green and pink, whose discreet paleness
    contrasts with the brutal gold of the gas. Two colourful
    figurines of lovers in the foreground.</p>

    <p>Also <art id=1453>a sketch</art> of <art id=0464>a 30 square
    canvas representing the house and its setting under a sulphur
    sun under a pure cobalt sky</art>. The theme is a hard one! But that is exactly why I want to
    conquer it. Because it is fantastic, these yellow houses in the sun and
    also the incomparable freshness of the blue. All the ground is
    yellow too. I will soon send you a better drawing of it than
    <art id=669_V-T_5430>this sketch out of my head</art>.</p>

    <p>The house on the left is pink with green shutters. It's the
    one that is shaded by a tree. This is the restaurant where I go
    to dine every day. My friend the factor is at the end of
    the street on the left, between the two bridges of the railroad.
    The night caf&eacute; that I painted is not in the picture, it
    is on the left of the restaurant.</p>

    <p>Milliet finds this horrible, but I don't need to tell you
    that when he says he doesn't understand that one can have fun
    doing a common grocer's shop and the stiff and proper houses
    without any grace, but I remember that Zola did a certain
    boulevard in the beginning of L'assommoir, and Flaubert a
    corner of the embankment of the Villette in the dog days in the
    beginning of Bouvard and P&eacute;cuchet which are not to be
    sneezed at.</p>

    <p>It does me good to do difficult things. It does not prevent
    me from having a terrible need of, shall I say the word - of
    religion - then I go outside in the night to paint the stars
    and I dream ever of a picture like this with a group of lively
    figures of our pals.</p>

    <p>Now I have had a letter from Gauguin who seems very sad, and
    says that certainly if he made a sale he will come, but he
    doesn't say clearly that if he would simply have his journey
    paid he would agree to come down here.</p>

    <p>He says that the people where he lodges are, and have been,
    great to him, and that to leave them like that would be a bad
    thing to do. But that I turn a dagger in his heart if I would
    believe that he would not immediately come if he was able to.
    That besides, if you could sell his canvases at a low price he
    would be happy. I will send you his letter with the
    replies.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">Certainly his arrival would be an increase of 100 percent in
    the importance of this enterprise of doing painting in the
    Midi. And once here, I don't see him leaving again because I
    believe that he would take root here.</label> And I always tell myself
    that what you are doing in private would in the end, with his
    collaboration, be a more serious thing than just my work,
    without an increase in the expenses and you would have more
    satisfaction. Later on, if maybe one day you are on your own
    with the impressionist paintings you will only have to continue
    and to enlarge on those which actually exists. Finally Gauguin
    says that Laval found someone who will give him 150 francs per
    month for at least one year, and that Laval also would maybe
    come in February. And I have written to Bernard that I think
    that in the Midi he could not live for less than 3.50 or 4
    francs per day just for lodging &amp; food. He says that he
    believes that for 200 francs per month he would have food and
    lodging for all 3 which is not impossible, if we live &amp; eat
    in the studio.</p>

    <p>The Benedictine father must have been very interesting. What
    would, according to him, be the future religion? Probably he
    would always say the same as the past.</p>

    <p>Victor Hugo says God is an eclipsing lighthouse, and
    certainly now we are passing through that eclipse.</p>

    <p>I only wish that someone could prove to us something calming
    which comforted us, so that we stopped feeling guilty or
    unhappy and that we could go forward without losing ourselves
    in the solitude or nothingness, and without having to fear
    every step, or to nervously calculate the harm we may
    unintentionally be doing to others.</p>

    <p>In odd Giotto's biography it said that he was always
    suffering and always full of ardour and ideas.</p>

    <p>There, I would like to arrive at this assurance that makes
    one happy, cheerful and alive all the time. That would be
    easier to do in the country or a small town than in that
    Parisian furnace.</p>

    <p>I would not be surprised if you will like the starry night
    and the ploughed fields - they are more tranquil than the other
    canvases. If the work always turned out like that I would have
    less concerns about money, because people would take to them
    more easily if the technique continued to be more harmonious.
    But this blasted mistral is very bothersome to do brushstrokes
    that hold and are well interwoven, with a feeling like music
    played with emotion.</p>

    <p>With this calm weather I let myself go and I don't have to
    struggle against impossibilities</p>

    <p>Tanguy's consignment arrived and I thank you very, very much
    for it because I also hope to be able to make something during
    autumn for the next exhibition. What is now the most pressing
    is 5 or even 10 meters of canvas. I write again that I will
    send Gauguin's letter with the reply.</p>

    <p>Very interesting what you say of Maurin; at 40 francs his
    drawings are certainly not expensive. More and more I come to
    believe that the true and proper trade of painting is one has
    to let oneself go with one's taste, one's learning before the
    masters, in short one's faith. It is not any easier, I am
    convinced, to make a good painting that to find a diamond or a
    pearl; it requires pain and one must risk his life as a dealer
    or as an artist. But once one has some good stones then self
    doubt is not necessary, and one must boldly stick to a certain
    price. In the meantime&hellip; but while this idea encourages
    me to work, still naturally I suffer at having to spend money.
    But in the midst of my suffering this idea of the pearl came to
    me, and I would not be surprised if it didn't do you good too
    in times of discouragement. There are as few good paintings as
    there are diamonds.</p>

    <p>And there is absolutely nothing dishonest about doing business with good stones.
    One can believe in oneself when one sees that the thing one is selling is good.Now,
    if people like paste, and it pleases them and since they ask for it, good, one can
    have it in the store, but it isn't enough to make one feel good about oneself with
    the good paintings, yet one can feel oneself and be firm, since it is a pure error
    that there is as much as one wants. Perhaps I am expressing myself badly, but I have
    thought about this a good deal these days, and calm has come to me about this Gauguin affair.</p>

    <p>All these Gauguins are good stones, and so let us boldly be merchants of Gauguin.</p>

    <p>Milliet says a good hello. I now have his portrait with a red kepi on emerald
    background, and in the background the arms of his regiment, the crescent and a 5-pointed star.</p>

    <p>A good handshake and until next time and many thanks and I hope that the pains
    will not last long. Have you seen a doctor again[?] Look after yourself, because physical
    pain is so agonising.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Editor's note: For many years this letter was considered as having a different ending.
    The recent re-emergence of the sketch of Vincent's house from obscurity revealed that he
    had finished his letter on the reverse side of it. The final four pages have been restored
    to their rightful place as the end of letter 541a.</p>
