  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you very much for your letter, for the 100 Fr. note
    enclosed and also for the 50 Fr. money order.</p>

    <p>I think myself that Gauguin was a little out of sorts with
    the good town of Arles, the little yellow house where we work,
    and especially with me. [Gauguin had written to Theo that
    Vincent and he could not go on living together &ldquo;in
    consequence of incompatibility of temper.&rdquo; The quarrel
    was made up, and Gauguin wrote another letter, speaking of the
    first as a bad dream.]</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact there are bound to be for him as for me
    further grave difficulties to overcome here.</p>

    <p>But these difficulties are rather within ourselves than
    outside.</p>

    <p>Altogether I think that either he will definitely go, or
    else definitely stay.</p>

    <p>Before doing anything I told him to think it over and reckon
    things up again.</p>

    <p>Gauguin is very powerful, strongly creative, but just
    because of that he must have peace.</p>

    <p>Will he find it anywhere if he does not find it here?</p>

    <p>I am waiting for him to make a decision with absolute
    serenity.</p>

    <p>A good handshake,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>[On the following day, December 24, a telegram arrived from
    Gauguin that called Theo to Arles. Vincent, in a state of
    terrible excitement and in a high fever, had cut off a piece of
    his own ear and taken it as a present to a woman in a brothel.
    There had been a violent scene; Roulin the postman managed to
    get him home, but the police intervened, found Vincent bleeding
    and unconscious in bed, and sent him to the hospital. Theo
    found him there, &ldquo;poor fighter and poor, poor
    sufferer,&rdquo; and stayed over Christmas. Gauguin went back
    with Theo to Paris. By December 31 the news was better, and on
    January 1 Vincent wrote Letter 566 in pencil.]</p>

    <p>[N.B. Some of the above note by Jo van Gogh-Bonger is
    doubtful. Roulin would not have left his friend bleeding; most
    probably Vincent found his own way home. The police only
    arrived the next morning, which is inexplicable, considering
    that Vincent was well-known both at the brothel and by the
    gendarmes, whose station was just across the road from his
    house.]</p>
