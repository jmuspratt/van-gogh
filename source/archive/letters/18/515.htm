    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Enclosed I am sending Gauguin's letter; fortunately he has
    recovered his health.</p>

    <p>How is yours?</p>

    <p>I wish Russell would do something. However, he has a wife
    and children, a studio, and a house being built, and I can
    quite see how a man, even a rich one, cannot always spend 100
    francs - no more than that - on pictures. I think it would make
    a tremendous difference to me if Gauguin were here, for now the
    days go by without my speaking a word to anyone. Oh well. In
    any case his letter gave me tremendous pleasure.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.loneliness">If you are alone in the country too long, you get stupid,
    and though not yet - still this winter - I may become sterile
    because of this. Now if he came, there would be no danger of
    this, because there would be no lack of ideas.</label></p>

    <p>If the work goes well and our courage does not fail, we may
    hope to see more very interesting years yet.</p>

    <p>Is Mourier still with you?</p>

    <p>Would it be possible for me to have your letter on Sunday,
    I'm not counting on it though, knowing that it is the end of
    the month.</p>

    <p>It's just that I shall probably have a model this week.</p>

    <p>I need some studies of figures very much. Just now I have a
    sort of exhibition at home, that is to say I have taken all the
    studies from the stretchers, and have nailed them up on the
    wall to get thoroughly dry. You will see that when there are a
    lot of them and one can choose among them, it comes to the same
    thing as if I had studied them more and worked on them longer.
    Because to paint and repaint a subject on the same or several
    canvases comes to the same thing in the end. I am in rather a
    hurry, so a handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
