  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter and for the 50-fr. note it
    contained. <label content="attitude.sisters">Certainly it is not out of the question that later
    on our sister might come and live with us. It speaks well for
    her taste that she likes sculpture; I was very glad to hear it</label>.
    Painting as it is now promises to become more subtle - more
    like music and less like sculpture - and above all it promises
    <i>colour</i>. If only it keeps this promise.</p>

    <p>The sunflowers are getting on, there is <art id=0458>a new bunch of 14
    flowers on a greenish-yellow ground</art>, so it is
    exactly the same effect - but in a larger size, a 30 canvas -
    as the <art id=0383>still life with the quinces and lemons</art>,
    which you already have - but in the sunflowers the painting is
    much more simple. Do you remember that we saw <art id=anet>a bunch of
    peonies by Manet at the Hotel Drouot one day? The flowers were
    pink, the leaves bright green painted in thick impasto, not
    glazed like Jeannin's, standing out against a plain white
    background, I think.</art></p>

    <p>That was a very sound piece of work.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">As for stippling and making halos and other things, I think
    they are real discoveries, but we must already see to it that
    this technique does not become a universal dogma any more than
    any other. That is another reason why Seurat's &ldquo;Grande
    Jatte,&rdquo; the landscapes with broad stippling by Signac and
    Anquetin's boat, will become in time even more personal and
    even more original.</label></p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">About my clothes, certainly they were beginning to be the
    worse for wear, but only last week I bought a black velvet
    jacket of fairly good quality for 20 francs, and a new hat, so
    there is no hurry.</label></p>

    <p>But I consulted that postman I painted, who had often
    furnished and refurnished his little home moving from place to
    place, as to the approximate price of the necessary furniture,
    and he said that you could not get a good bed here which would
    last for less than 150 francs - if <i>you want to get something
    substantial</i>, of course.</p>

    <p>However, that hardly upsets the calculation that by saving
    the money spent on lodging, at the end of a year we should find
    ourselves in possession of some furniture, without having spent
    any more during the year. And as soon as I can, I shall not
    hesitate to do it.</p>

    <p>If Gauguin and I do not take the opportunity to fix
    ourselves up like this, we may drag on year after year in small
    lodgings where we cannot fail to go to seed. I have pretty well
    done that already, for it has been going on for a very long
    time. And now it has even ceased to be unpleasant, and perhaps
    at first I shall not feel at home when I am home. Never mind.
    However, we must not forget Bouvard and Pecuchet, we must not
    forget &ldquo;<i>&agrave; Veau l'eau</i>,&rdquo; for it is all
    true, most profoundly true.</p>

    <p>Au Bonheur des Dames and Bel Ami are no less true, however.
    They are different ways of looking at things - with the first
    there is less risk of behaving like Don Quixote perhaps, with
    the second you go the whole hog.</p>

    <p>This week I have had <art id=0444>the old peasant once again</art>.</p>

    <p>Oh - McKnight has left at last - I am not sorry. His friend
    the Belgian did not seem very upset either when he came here
    yesterday to tell me, and we spent the evening together. He has
    very sensible ideas, and at least he knows what he wants.</p>

    <p>At present he is painting a kind of timid impressionism, but
    very orderly and very exact. And I told him that it was the
    best thing he could do, because although he would lose two
    years perhaps suppressing his individuality, yet it is as
    necessary to have a regular course in impressionism now as it
    was formerly to have a course in a Parisian studio. He agreed
    with this entirely, just because in this way you offend no one,
    and cannot be accused afterward of knowing nothing about the
    problem. He is seriously thinking of going to paint the miners
    of the Borinage, and if he is still here when Gauguin comes, it
    is not impossible that we will ask him to do for us in the
    North what we would do for him in the South, that is, do our
    utmost to enable him to live more cheaply than he would do
    alone.</p>

    <p>Goodbye for the present.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
