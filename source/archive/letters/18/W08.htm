    <p>Letter W08<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Arles, c. 27 August 1888</p>

    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p>It will really simplify the writing of my letter if you will
    let me write in French.</p>

    <p>I am quite delighted to hear that you get more excited by
    sculpture than by painting - all the more since Theo assures me
    that your judgment of pictures is sound too.</p>

    <p>Of course this cannot yet be a fixed taste that would never
    waver; but having intuition, instinct, is already a great
    thing, and it is exactly what not everybody always has. But all
    the same I am very curious to know what impression the
    Luxembourg will make on you.</p>

    <p>It is true that at moments, when I am in a good mood, I
    think that what is alive in art, and eternally alive, is in the
    first place the painter and in the second place the
    picture.</p>

    <p>Never mind, it is of no importance - however, to <i>see</i>
    fellows <i>work</i> is still something one will not find under
    glass in museums.</p>

    <p>Poor Miss Harriet in Guy de Maupassant's book was perhaps in
    the right. But did the painter do wrong when he went with the
    servant girl from the farm? Perhaps not. There is always some
    pretty annoying fatality in life. Well, painters die, or go mad
    with despair, or are paralyzed in their production, because
    nobody likes them personally.</p>

    <p>Have you read the American poems by <i>Whitman</i>? I am
    sure Theo has them, and I strongly advise you to read them,
    because to begin with they are really fine, and the English
    speak about them a good deal. He sees in the future, and even
    in the present, a world of healthy, carnal love, strong and
    frank - of friendship - of work - under the great starlit vault
    of heaven a something which after all one can only call God -
    and eternity in its place above this world. At first it makes
    you smile, it is all so candid and pure; but it sets you
    thinking for the same reason.</p>

    <p>The &ldquo;Prayer of Columbus&rdquo; is very beautiful.</p>

    <p>What is your opinion of the bunch of flowers by Monticelli
    which is at Theo's, and also of the &ldquo;Spanish Woman&rdquo;
    by Pr&eacute;vost? These are truly two pictures of the
    South.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">I think of Monticelli terribly often here. He was a strong
    man - a little cracked or rather very much so - dreaming of the
    sun and of love and gaiety, but always harassed by poverty - of
    an extremely refined taste as a colourist, a thoroughbred man
    of a rare race, continuing the best traditions of the past. He
    died at Marseilles in rather sad circumstances, and probably
    after passing through a regular Gethsemane. Now listen, for
    myself I am sure that I am continuing his work here, as if I
    were his son or his brother.</label></p>

    <p>We just spoke of the hour of fatality which seems sad to us.
    But isn't there another fatality which is charming? And what do
    we care whether there is a resurrection or not, as long as we
    see a living man arise immediately in the place of the dead
    man? Let us take up the same cause again, continuing the same
    work, living the same life, dying the same death.</p>

    <p>When my friend Gauguin is here, and we two go to Marseilles,
    it is my firm intention to go saunter in the
    Cannebi&eacute;re there, dressed exactly like him,
    Monticelli, as I have seen his portrait, with an enormous
    yellow hat, a black velvet jacket, white trousers, yellow
    gloves, a bamboo cane, and with a grand southern air.</p>

    <p>And there I shall find Marseillais who used to know him when
    he was alive, and if you have read in Tartarin what
    f&ecirc;n de br&ucirc;t means &hellip;</p>

    <p>And there will be noise du bruit, on that occasion.
    Monticelli is a painter who did the South all in yellow, all in
    orange, all in sulphur. The great majority of the painters,
    because they aren't colourists in the true sense of the word,
    do not use these colours there, and they call a painter mad if
    he sees with eyes other than theirs.* Of course all this is
    only to be expected. So I myself too have already finished a
    picture all in yellow - <art id=0458>of sunflowers (fourteen flowers in a
    yellow vase and against a yellow background</art>,
    which is certainly different from <art id=0456>the previous one with twelve
    flowers on a blue-green background)</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">And I expect that I shall one day exhibit the former at
    Marseilles, and then there will be some Marseillais or other
    who will remember what Monticelli said and did in his time.</label></p>

    <p>Did Theo show you the tansy? It is very beautiful.</p>

    <p>Enjoy yourself as much as possible; I embrace you in
    thought.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>* You will see Monthenards in the Luxembourg which are not
    yellow at all, and that I like very much nevertheless, but it
    is likely that Monthenard would think the things I do
    despicable.</p>
