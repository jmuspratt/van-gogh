  <body>
    <p>My dear comrade Bernard,</p>

    <p>The package you and Gauguin sent arrived almost
    simultaneously with the forwarding of my studies. I was very
    much amused; it warmed my heart greatly to see <art id=auguinsp>those two faces
    again</art>. As for <art id=ernardsp>your portrait</art>, you know, I like it very much. As
    a matter of fact I like everything you do very much, as you
    know, and possibly there has not been anybody before me who
    liked what you do as much as I.<br>
     I strongly urge you to study portrait painting, do as many
    portraits as you can and don't flag. We must win the public
    over later on by means of the portrait; in my opinion it is the
    thing of the future. But don't let's lose our way in hypotheses
    now.<br>
     And now that I have started thanking you, I thank you
    furthermore for the batch of sketches entitled &ldquo;At the
    Brothel.&rdquo; Bravo! It seems to me that the woman washing
    herself and the one saying, &ldquo;There is none other like me
    when it comes to exhausting a man,&rdquo; are the best; the
    others are grimacing too much, and above all they are done too
    vaguely, they are too little living flesh, not built up
    sufficiently. But no matter, these other ones too are something
    quite new and interesting. At the brothel! Yes, that's what one
    ought to do, and I assure you that I for one am almost jealous
    of the damned fine opportunity you will have of going there in
    your uniform, - which these good little women dote on.<br>
     The poem at the end is really beautiful; it stands more firmly
    on its own feet than certain figures. What you want to express
    and what you say you believe, you say well and sonorously.<br>
     Let me know when you will be in Paris. The fact is that I have
    already written you a thousand times that my night caf&eacute;
    isn't a brothel; it is a caf&eacute; where night prowlers cease
    to be night prowlers, because they flop down at a table and
    spend the whole night thus without prowling at all. It may
    happen that a whore brings her fellow along.<br>
     But going in one evening I came upon a little group, a pimp
    and his whore making up after a fight. The woman pretended to
    be indifferent and haughty, the man was wheedling. I got busy
    <art id=0478>painting it for you from memory on a little canvas,
    size 4 or 6</art>. So if you are leaving soon, I will send it
    to you in Paris; if you are staying on, let me know; it was not
    dry enough to be included in the package.<label content="art.technique"> I won't sign this
    study, for I never work from memory. There is some colour in it
    which will please you, but once again, I have painted a study
    for you which I should have preferred not to paint.</label><br>
     I have mercilessly destroyed one important canvas - a
    &ldquo;Christ with the Angel in Gethsemane&rdquo; - and another
    one representing the &ldquo;Poet against a Starry Sky&rdquo; -
    in spite of the fact that the colour was right - because the
    form had not been studied beforehand from the model, which is
    necessary in such cases. As for the study I am sending you in
    exchange, if you do not like it, you will only have to look at
    it a little longer.<br>
     I had a devil of a job doing it during a pestering mistral
    (just like the study in red and green). And look, although it
    is not painted as fluently as <art id=0550>the &ldquo;Old Mill,&rdquo;</art> it is
    more delicate and intimate. You will see that all this isn't in
    the least impressionistic; dear me, all the worse then. I am
    doing what I am doing, surrendering myself to nature, without
    thinking of this or that. Of course, if you should prefer
    another study in this batch to <art id=0449>the &ldquo;Men Unloading
    Sand,&rdquo;</art> you can take it and erase the dedication, if
    someone else will have it. But I think you will like this one,
    once you have looked at it a bit longer.<br>
     If Laval, Moret and the other one <sup>1</sup> want to
    exchange with me, splendid! But for my part I should be
    particularly delighted if they would paint their portraits for
    me.<br>
     You know, Bernard, I feel sure that if I wanted to do studies
    of brothels, it would cost me more money than I have; I am no
    longer young and my body is not attractive enough to women to
    get them to pose for me free for nothing.<br>
     And I cannot work without a model. I won't say that I don't
    turn my back on nature ruthlessly in order to turn a study into
    a picture, arranging the colours, enlarging and simplifying;
    but in the matter of form I am too afraid of departing from the
    possible and the true.<br>
     I don't mean I won't do it after another ten years of painting
    studies, but, to tell the honest truth, my attention is so
    fixed on what is possible and really exists that I hardly have
    the desire or the courage to strive for the ideal as it might
    result from my abstract studies.<br>
     Others may have more lucidity than I do in the matter of
    abstract studies, and it is certainly possible that you are one
    of their number, Gauguin too ... and perhaps I myself when I am
    old.<br>
     But in the meantime I am getting well acquainted with nature.
    <label content="art.technique">I exaggerate, sometimes I make changes in a motif; but for all
    that, I do not invent the whole picture; on the contrary, I
    find it all ready in nature, only it must be disentangled.</label><br>
     You will probably think these studies ugly. I don't know. In
    any case neither you, nor I, nor anybody else should make an
    exchange unwillingly. My brother writes me that Anquetin is
    back in Paris, I should like to know what he has done. When you
    see him, remember me most kindly to him.<br>
     My house will seem to me more lived-in now that I am going to
    see the portraits in it. How delighted I should be to see you
    yourself in it this winter! It is true that the journey is
    rather expensive. But all the same, can't one risk these
    expenses and recoup oneself by means of one's work? In winter,
    in the North, work is so difficult! Here too perhaps - I have
    hardly had any experience of it yet, and so I must wait and
    see; but it is a damned useful thing to see the South - where
    so much more of life is spent in the open air - in order to
    understand the Japanese better.<br>
     And then a certain quality of loftiness and nobility which can
    be found in some of the spots here will be very profitable to
    you.<br>
     The sun in the &ldquo;Red Sunset&rdquo; should be imagined
    higher up, outside the picture, let's say on a level with the
    frame. In this way, an hour or an hour and a half before
    sunset, the things on earth still keep their colour. Later on
    the blue and violet make them look blacker, as soon as the sun
    sends its rays more horizontally. Thanks again for your
    package, which has warmed my heart greatly, and a cordial
    handshake in thought. Write me the date of your departure, so
    that I shall know when you will be in Paris; your Paris address
    is still 5 Avenue Beaulieu, isn't it?</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>1. Ernest Chamaillard.</p>
