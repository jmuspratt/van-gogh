  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>This morning, at long last, the weather changed and turned
    milder - and likewise I have already had an opportunity to
    learn what a mistral is: I have been for several walks in the
    country hereabouts but it is quite impossible to do anything in
    this wind. The sky is a hard blue with a great bright sun which
    has melted almost all the snow, but the wind is cold and so dry
    that it gives you gooseflesh.</p>

    <p>But all the same I have seen lots of beautiful things - a
    ruined abbey on a hill covered with holly, pines, and grey
    olives.</p>

    <p>We'll have a try at that soon, I hope.</p>

    <p>I have just finished a study like the one<art id=0378> Lucien Pissarro
    has of mine</art>, but this time <art id=0395>it is oranges</art>.
    That makes eight studies so far. But this
    doesn't really count, because I haven't yet been able to work
    in any comfort or warmth.</p>

    <p>The letter from Gauguin which I meant to send you, and which
    I thought for the moment had got burned with other papers, I
    have since found, and am enclosing it. But I have already
    written direct to him, and sent him Russell's address, also
    Gauguin's to Russell, so that if they like, they can deal with
    each other direct.</p>

    <p>But how difficult for many of us - and assuredly we
    ourselves are among the number - the future is! I firmly
    believe in the ultimate victory, but will the artists
    themselves gain any advantage from it, and will they see less
    troubled days?</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">I have bought some coarse canvas here, and had it prepared
    for mat effects.</label> I can get everything now almost at the same
    prices as in Paris. Saturday evening I had a visit from two
    amateur artists, a grocer who sells painting materials as well,
    and a magistrate who seems a nice fellow, and intelligent.</p>

    <p>Worse luck, I can hardly manage to live any cheaper than in
    Paris, I must figure it at 5 Fr. a day.</p>

    <p>I have not yet found any sort of small place where I could
    have private board and lodging, but all the same something of
    the kind must exist.</p>

    <p>If the weather is milder in Paris too, it will do you good.
    What a winter! I dare not roll up my studies yet because they
    are hardly dry and there are some bits of impasto which will
    take some time to dry.</p>

    <p>I have just finished reading Tartarin on the Alps, which
    amused me hugely.</p>

    <p>Has that confounded Tersteeg written you yet? All to the
    good if he has. If he doesn't answer, he will hear of us all
    the same, and we shall see to it that he can find no fault with
    our actions. For instance, we will send a picture to Mrs. Mauve
    in memory of Mauve, with a letter from both of us, in which,
    supposing Tersteeg does not reply, we shall not say a word
    against him, but we will manage to convey that we do not
    deserve to be treated as if we were dead. But indeed, it is not
    likely that Tersteeg will have any prejudice against us on the
    whole.</p>

    <p>Poor Gauguin has no luck. I am very much afraid that in his
    case convalescence will last even longer than the fortnight
    which he has had to spend in bed.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">My God! Shall we ever see a generation of artists with
    healthy bodies! Sometimes I am perfectly furious with myself,
    for it isn't good enough to be either more or less ill than the
    rest; the ideal would be a constitution tough enough to live
    till eighty, and besides that, blood in one's veins that would
    be right good blood.</label></p>

    <p>It would be some comfort, however, if one could think that a
    generation of more fortunate artists was to come.</p>

    <p>I wanted to write you at once that I am in hopes winter is
    really over, and I hope that it is the same in Paris.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
