    <p>Dear Sister,</p>

    <p>I for my part might say just as well that I shall stop
    writing at the very moment you reply. The simplest thing is not
    to write if it causes too much trouble and the inclination is
    not always there.</p>

    <p>But, however this may be, it is an excellent thing that you
    are beginning to acquaint yourself with all the mischief brewed
    by that villain Voltaire, and you will surely find that in
    Candide Voltaire already had the impertinence to laugh at the
    &ldquo;highly serious life, which we ought only to use for, and
    devote to, the best ends.&rdquo; And I need not tell you that
    this crime is something horrible in itself.</p>

    <p>I cannot write very well about Mauve; I think of him every
    day, but that's all. <sup>1</sup> It was a great shock to me;
    but personally, as a human being, he may have been quite
    different from what people said of him once in a while - that
    is, more deeply engrossed in life itself than in art perhaps;
    and I loved him as a human being. Now it is so hard for me to
    imagine that those who penetrate to the core of life, who for
    the rest judge themselves as if they were dealing with somebody
    else, and who treat others as unceremoniously as though they
    were taking themselves to task - I find it so hard to imagine
    that such can cease to exist.</p>

    <p>Now I know that it is hardly to be supposed that the white
    potato and salad grubs which later change into cockchafers
    should be able to form tenable ideas about their supernatural
    existence in the hereafter. And that it would be premature of
    them to enter upon supernatural researches for enlightenment
    about this problem, seeing that the gardener or other persons
    interested in salad and vegetables would crush them underfoot,
    considering them harmful insects.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.death">But for parallel reasons I have little confidence in the
    correctness of our human concepts of a future life. We are as
    little able to judge of our own metamorphoses without bias and
    prematureness as the white salad grubs can of theirs,</label> for the
    very cogent reason that the salad worms ought to eat salad
    roots in the very interest of their higher development.</p>

    <p>In the same way I think that a painter ought to paint
    pictures; possibly something else may come after that.</p>

    <p>You see that I have penetrated some greater distance into
    the South - <label content="health.general">I have observed too often that neither my work nor
    my health is in very good condition during the winter.</label> Besides,
    what they want in pictures nowadays is a contrast of colours,
    and these colours highly intensified and variegated, rather
    than subdued gray tones. So for one reason or another I thought
    I should do nobody harm if I went to the spot that attracted
    me.</p>

    <p>Give my love to Mother, and for the time being there will
    not be much chance of my going back to Holland. Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>[In another hand - almost certainly Wilhelmina's]
