  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I suppose it was to convince me that, being myself one of
    the most absent-minded of mortals, I have no right whatever to
    reproach these Southerners with their carelessness. I was idiot
    enough once more to address my letter 54 Rue de Laval, instead
    of 54 Rue Lepic, so the post-office clerks, who sent me back
    the letter opened, have had the pleasure of edifying themselves
    by the contemplation of Bernard's brothel. I hasten to send on
    the letter as it is.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">This morning I received part of the order for paints from
    Tanguy.</p>

    <p>His cobalt is too bad for us to order any more of it from
    him. As his chromes are rather good, we can go on ordering
    those. But instead of carmine he sent some dark madder, which
    isn't too important, but not to have any more carmine at all
    would mean a very serious shortage in his poor old show. It is
    not his fault, but in the future I will put
    &ldquo;Tanguy&rdquo; beside the names of the paints that one
    can buy from him.</label></p>

    <p>Yesterday and today I worked on <art id=0422>the sower, which I have
    completely worked over. The sky is yellow and green, the ground
    violet and orange</art>. There is certainly a
    picture of this kind to be painted of this splendid subject,
    and I hope it will be done someday, either by me or by someone
    else.</p>

    <p>This is the point. The<art id=elacroix> &ldquo;Christ in the Boat&rdquo;</art> by
    Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix and Millet's &ldquo;The Sower&rdquo;
    are absolutely different in execution. The &ldquo;Christ in the
    Boat&rdquo; - I am speaking of the sketch in blue and green
    with touches of violet, red and a little citron-yellow for the
    nimbus, the halo - speaks a symbolic language through colour
    alone.</p>

    <p>Millet's &ldquo;Sower&rdquo; is a colourless <i>grey</i>,
    like Isra&euml;ls's pictures.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">Now, could you paint the Sower in colour, with a
    simultaneous contrast of, for instance, yellow and violet (like
    the Apollo ceiling of Delacroix's <i>which is just that, yellow
    and violet</i>), yes or no? Why, <i>yes</i>. Well, do it then.
    Yes, that is what old Martin said, &ldquo;The masterpiece is up
    to you.&rdquo; But try it, and you tumble into a regular
    metaphysical philosophy of colour &agrave; la Monticelli, a
    mess that is damnably difficult to get out of with honour.</p>

    <p>And it makes you as absent-minded as a sleepwalker. And yet
    if only one could do something good.</label></p>

    <p>Well, let's be of good heart, and not despair. I hope to
    send you this attempt along with some others soon. I have a
    view of the Rh&ocirc;ne - <art id=0426>the iron bridge at Trinquetaille</art> - in
    which the sky and the river are the colour of absinthe; the
    quays, a shade of lilac; the figures leaning on their elbows on
    the parapet, blackish; the iron bridge, an intense blue, with a
    note of vivid orange in the blue background, and a note of
    intense malachite green. Another very crude effort, and yet I
    am trying to get at something utterly heartbroken and therefore
    utterly heartbreaking.</p>

    <p>Nothing from Gauguin. I certainly hope to get your letter
    tomorrow. Forgive my carelessness. A handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Many thanks for the paints. Goodbye for now.</p>
