  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am overjoyed to hear what you tell me of your two new
    friends. <sup>1</sup> But all the same it amazes me that you
    tell me about them and their frame (at, if my memory serves me,
    2000 fr.) and never a word of what was inside that frame, nor a
    single word of what they had done in the way of painting.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it is because you think that I may have heard of
    them, but I declare it is the first time I have heard of this
    business, and even of the men themselves.</p>

    <p>So being ignorant of things, I should like to ask,
    &ldquo;Yes, yes, so much for the frame, but what was there
    inside it, and what are they actually doing?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>After that I shall certainly be better able to get some idea
    of what their conversations with you and Pissarro were, once I
    have some notion of what they themselves are doing.</p>

    <p>In any case it proves one thing, that the Dutch artists have
    spoken of you as the dealer in impressionist pictures, and we
    must not lose sight of that.</p>

    <p>Then what did they tell you of Dutch art, Breitner and
    Rappard and others, and lastly what do they say about
    Tersteeg?</p>

    <p>Gauguin writes that he has already sent off his trunk and
    promises to come about the twentieth of this month, that is
    within a few days. I shall be very glad, because I do believe
    that it will do both of us good. So write me some details about
    the new friends' painting soon, and if they are really painters
    trying to make progress in virgin fields, boldly recommend the
    South to them. I believe that a new school of <i>colourists</i>
    will take root in the South, as I see more and more that those
    in the North rely on their ability with the brush, and the
    so-called &ldquo;picturesque,&rdquo; rather than on the desire
    to express something by colour itself. Your news gave me great
    pleasure, but it so astonishes me not to know what there was
    inside that frame.</p>

    <p>Here, under a stronger sun, I have found what Pissarro said
    confirmed, and also what Gauguin wrote to me, the simplicity,
    the fading of the colours, the gravity of great sunlight
    effects.</p>

    <p>You never come near to suspecting it in the North. And if
    these artists of the monstrous frame really wish to see
    something new, let them go to Bing, and then to the South.
    Myself, I already had palpitations over my order for pine wood
    frames at 5 francs.</p>

    <p>It is just what I said to Russell about his house, that this
    one here would cost several times less in hundreds than his
    will cost in thousands, and that after all, even without
    Russell, we were working for Gauguin.</p>

    <p>Have they seen anything of Seurat's, our gentlemen of the
    frame? I think that as a creation I should prefer Seurat's
    frame to theirs.</p>

    <p>By the way, speaking of Seurat, have you seen him again?</p>

    <p>As to selling, I say you are certainly right not to go out
    of your way looking for sales, I certainly should prefer never
    to sell, if it could be.</p>

    <p>But all the same if we were forced to it, certainly after
    what has gone before we have no alternative, yet even though we
    might be obliged to do it someday, we could not do better than
    take our time about it.</p>

    <p>A good handshake, and I hope that you will tell me what
    there really was inside the frame. And regards to the new
    friends, and my best wishes.</p>

    <p>If they want to see something new, certainly they could go
    South, or to Africa or Sicily if it is winter. But if they have
    originality, it is only the real South that will show them
    anything different from Holland.</p>

    <p>Good-by, I hope for only a little while, and that you will
    write again soon, a good handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Have you read Madame Chrysanth&egrave;me yet?</p>

    <p>I am adding a line to tell you that this afternoon I
    finished <art id=0482>the canvas representing the bedroom</art>.</p>

    <p>In any case it pleased me mightily that you should have
    fallen in with these Dutchmen. It is really quite possible that
    I may have heard of this large picture, though not of the
    frame. Some time ago Rappard told me a story praising a picture
    and its painter, and I can easily tell if it's the same picture
    when you tell me what they are doing.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">However that may be, my dear boy, look here - if you
    complain of having nothing in your noodle in the way of
    producing good stuff, just imagine <i>how very much more
    reason</i> I have for feeling the same depression. I could not
    even do a stroke of work without you, and we must not go and
    get excited over what the two of us manage to produce, but just
    smoke our pipes in peace and not torment ourselves into
    melancholia because we are not productive separately and with
    less pain.</label></p>

    <p>Certainly I have my own moments when I should dearly like to
    change and be in business for a bit, and by so doing be able to
    earn some money myself.</p>

    <p>But since for the moment we can do nothing to change it,
    let's accept this fate, that you on your part are condemned
    always to do business without rest or change, and that I on my
    part also have a job without rest, wearing enough and
    exhausting to the brain. I hope that within a year you will
    feel that between us we have produced a work of art.</p>

    <p>This bedroom is something like <art id=0359>the still life of the
    &ldquo;Romans Parisiens&rdquo; with the yellow, pink and green
    covers, you remember it</art>. But I think the
    workmanship is more virile and simple. No stippling, no
    hatching, nothing, only flat colours in harmony.</p>

    <p><label content="health.eyes">I do not know what I shall undertake next, for my eyes are
    still tired even yet.</label></p>

    <p>And in just such moments after hard work - and all the more
    the harder it is - I feel my own noodle empty too, you
    know.</p>

    <p>And if I let myself go, nothing would be easier than to
    detest what I have just done, and kick my foot through it a few
    times, like old C&eacute;zanne. After all, why kick my foot
    through it - let's leave the studies in peace, even if one sees
    no good in them; and if we see something that may be called
    good, well, so much the better.</p>

    <p>And after all, don't let's meditate on good and bad too
    deeply - they're always relative.</p>

    <p>That is exactly the fault of the Dutch, to call one thing
    absolutely good and another absolutely bad. Nothing in the
    world is as hard and fast as that.</p>

    <p>By the way, I have read Richepin's C&eacute;sarine too;
    there are some very good things in it, that march on the
    retreating soldiers, how one feels their weariness, and without
    being soldiers, haven't we all marched like that sometime?</p>

    <p>The quarrel of the father and son is just heartbreaking, but
    it is like La Glu, also by Richepin. I find that it leaves no
    hope, whereas Guy de Maupassant, who has written things
    certainly as sad, lets things end more humanely in the end.
    Look at Monsieur Parent, look at Pierre et Jean, it does not
    end in happiness, but in the end people are resigned and go on
    in spite of everything. It does not end in blood and horrors
    like the other things. Indeed, I much prefer Guy de Maupassant
    because he is more comforting. At the moment I have just
    finished Eug&eacute;nie Grandet by Balzac, the story of a
    miserly peasant.</p>

    <p>Good-by, I hope for only a little while.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Come now, if we do not produce pictures with frames like
    these Dutchmen's, you and I are making pictures like Japanese
    prints, and let's be content with that.</p>

        <p>The painter Meyer de Haan and his friend Isa&auml;cson.
        De Haan exhibited his large picture &ldquo;Uriel
        Acosta&rdquo; in the Panorama in Amsterdam; discouraged by
        the unfavourable criticism, he went to Paris and lived
        there for a short time with Theo. After the latter's
        marriage he went to Pont-Aven, where he lived and worked
        with Gauguin. He died in Amsterdam in 1895. Nothing is
        known of his work in France. Isa&auml;cson wrote a few
        articles on the art of painting in the periodical <i>Le</i>
        <i>Portefeuille</i>. Nothing is known of his paintings of
        that time.</p>
