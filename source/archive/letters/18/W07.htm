    <p>Letter W07<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Arles, 9 and 16 September 1888</p>

    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p>Your letter gave me a great deal of pleasure, and today
    I have the leisure to calmly reply. So your visit to
    Paris was quite a success. I should very much like you to come
    here next year too. At the moment I am furnishing the
    studio in order to always be ready to put
    somebody up. Because there are 2 little rooms upstairs
    looking onto a very pretty public garden, and from which one can
    see the sun rise in the morning. I will arrange one of these
    rooms to accomodate a friend, and
    the other will be for me.</p>

    <p>In it I want nothing but straw-bottomed chairs and a
    table and a whitewood bed. The walls whitewashed, the tiles red.
    But I want a great wealth of portraits and
    painted studies of figures in it, which I intend to do in
    the course of time. I already have one to begin with,
    <art id=0462>the portrait of a young Belgian impressionist. I have painted
    him a little like a poet, the head fine & nervous standing out
    against a background of a deep ultramarine night sky with
    the twinkling of stars</art>.</p>

    <p>However, I want to have the other room just as elegant with a
    walnut bedstead and a blue coverlet. And all the rest, the
    dressing table as well as the cupboard, in dull walnut. In this
    very tiny room I want to put, in the Japanese manner, at
    least 6 very large canvases, particularly the enormous
    bouquets of sunflowers. You know that the Japanese
    instinctively look for contrasts and eat sweet peppers, salted candy,
    fried ices and iced fried things. So it follows, according to
    the same system, that in a large room there should only be very small
    pictures and in a very small room one should hang very large
    ones. I hope the day will come when I shall be able to show you
    this beautiful country here.</p>

    <p>I have just finished <art id=0463>a canvas representing the interior of a
    night caf&eacute; illuminated by lamps. A few poor
    night wanderers are asleep in a corner. The room is painted
    red, and there under the gaslight the green billiard table
    casts an immense shadow on the floor.
    There are 6 or 7 different reds in this canvas, from
    blood red to delicate pink, contrasting with as many pale or
    deep greens</art>. I sent Theo <art id=1463>a sketch of it today which is like a
    Japanese crepe print</art>.</p>

    <p>Theo wrote me that he had given you Japanese pictures. This
    is surely the practical way to arrive at an understanding of
    the direction which painting in bright clear colours has taken
    at present.</p>

    <p>For my part I don't need Japanese pictures here, for I
    always tell myself <i>that here I am in Japan</i>. Which
    means that I have only to open my eyes and paint the effect of what is right
    in front of me.</p>

    <p>Have you seen a very little mask of a smiling fat Japanese
    woman at Theo's? It is surprisingly expressive, that little
    mask. Did you think of taking a painting of mine there for yourself? I
    hope so, and I am very curious to know which one you chose. I
    am inclined to think that you took <art id=0419>the white cabins
    surrounded by green plants under a blue sky, which I made at
    Saintes-Maries on the coast of the Mediterranean</art>.</p>

    <p>I ought to have gone back to Saintes-Maries again, as there
    are now people on the beach. But never mind, I have such a lot
    to do here. At present I absolutely want to paint a starry sky.
    It often seems to me that night is still more richly coloured
    than the day; having hues of the most intense violets, blues
    and greens. If only you pay attention to it you will see that
    certain stars are lemon-yellow, others pink or a
    green, blue and forget-me-not brilliance. And without my
    expatiating on this theme it is obvious that putting little
    white dots on the blue-black is not enough to paint a starry sky.</p>

    <p>My house here is painted the yellow colour of fresh butter
    outside with raw green shutters; it stands in the
    full sunlight on a square which has a green garden with plane
    trees, oleanders and acacias. And it is completely whitewashed
    inside, and the floor is made of red bricks. And over it
    the intensely blue sky. There I can live and breathe,
    think and paint.<label content="health.general"> And it seems to me that I might go
    farther into the South, rather than go back up to the North again,
    seeing that I am greatly in need of a strong heat, so that my
    blood can circulate normally. Here I feel much better than I
    did in Paris.</label></p>

    <p>You see, I can hardly doubt that you on your part would also
    like the South enormously. The fact is that the sun has never
    penetrated us people of the North enough.</p>

    <p>It is already a few days
    since I started writing this letter, and now I will continue
    it. In point of fact I was interrupted these days by my toiling
    on <art id=0467>a new picture representing the outside of a
    caf&eacute; at night. On the terrace there are the tiny figures of
    drinkers. An immense yellow lantern illuminates
    the terrace, the fa&ccedil;ade and the sidewalk, and even casts
    its light on the pavement of the streets, which takes
    a pinkish violet tone. The gables of the houses
    in the street stretching away under a blue sky spangled with
    stars are dark blue or violet with a green tree. Here
    you have a night picture without black in it, done with
    nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green, and
    lemon-yellow</art>. <label content="art.technique">It amuses me enormously
    to paint the night right on the spot. They used to draw and
    paint the picture in the daytime after the sketch. But I
    find satisfaction in painting the thing immediately.</p>

    <p>Of course it's true that in the dark I may mistake a blue
    for a green, a blue-lilac for a pink-lilac, for you cannot
    distinguish the quality of a hue very well. But it is the only
    way to get rid of the conventional night scenes with their poor
    sallow whitish light, when even a simple candle gives us
    the richest yellows and orange tints.</label></p>

    <p>I also made <art id=0476>a new portrait of myself, a study, in which I
    look like a Japanese</art>.</p>

    <p>So far you have not told me whether you have read Bel Ami by
    Guy de Maupassant, and what in general you think of his talent
    now. I say this because the beginning of Bel Ami happens to be
    a description of a starlight night in Paris with the brightly
    lighted caf&eacute;s of the Boulevard, and this is
    approximately the same subject I just painted.</p>

    <p>Speaking of Guy de Maupassant, I want to tell you that I
    very much admire what he does, and I strongly urge you to read
    everything that he has written. You ought to read Zola, de Maupassant,
    de Goncourt as completely as possible in order to get something
    of a clear insight into the modern novel. Have you read
    Balzac? I am reading him again here.</p>

    <p>My dear sister, it is my belief that it is actually one's
    duty to paint the rich and magnificent aspects of nature. We
    need gaiety and happiness, hope and love.</p>

    <p>The more ugly, old, mean, ill, poor I get, the more I
    want to take my revenge by producing a brilliant colour, well
    arranged, resplendent. Jewellers too get old and ugly before
    they learn how to arrange precious stones properly. And arranging
    the colours in a painting in order to make them vibrate and to
    enhance their value by their contrasts is something like
    arranging jewels properly or designing costumes. You will see
    that by making a habit of looking at Japanese pictures you will
    love to make up bouquets and to do things with flowers all the
    more. I must finish this letter now if I want to get it off
    today. I shall be very happy to have the picture of Mother that
    you speak of, so don't forget to send it to me. Give my dearest
    love to Mother, I often think of you two, and it pleases me
    very much that you know our life a little better now.</p>

    <p>I'm afraid Theo will feel too lonely now, but he will be
    visited by a Belgian impressionist painter one of these days,
    the one I told you about at the beginning of this letter, and
    who is going to spend some time in Paris. And there will be a
    lot of other painters who will return to Paris with the studies
    they did during the fine season &hellip;</p>

    <p>I embrace you and Mother.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
