  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Yesterday I went to the furniture dealer's to see if I could
    hire a bed etc. Unfortunately they would <i>not</i> hire, and
    even refused to sell on a monthly installment plan. This is
    rather awkward.</p>

    <p>I thought perhaps if Koning leaves after seeing the Salon
    which I believe was his original intention, that you might send
    me the bed that he now occupies after his departure. One must
    take into account that if I sleep at the studio it will make a
    difference of 300 Frs. a year which would otherwise have to be
    paid to the hotel. I know that it is impossible to say in
    advance that I shall stay here so long but all the same I have
    many reasons for thinking that a long stay here is
    probable.</p>

    <p>I was in Fontvieille yesterday at McKnight's; he had a good
    pastel - a pink tree - and two watercolours just started, and I
    found him working on the head of an old woman in charcoal. He
    has reached the stage where he is plagued by new colour
    theories, and while they prevent him from working on the old
    system, he is not sufficiently master of his new palette to
    succeed in this one. He seemed very shy about showing me the
    things, I had to go there for that express purpose, and tell
    him that I was <i>absolutely</i> set on seeing his work.</p>

    <p>It is not impossible that he may come to stay for some time
    with me here. I think we should both benefit by it.</p>

    <p>I think very often of Renoir and that pure clean line of
    his. That's just how things and people look in this clear
    air.</p>

    <p>We are having a tremendous lot of wind and mistral here,
    just now three days out of four, though the sun shines anyway:
    but it makes it difficult to work out-of-doors.</p>

    <p>I think there would be something to do here in portraits.
    Although the people are blankly ignorant of painting in
    general, they are much more artistic than in the North in their
    own persons and their manner of life. I have seen figures here
    quite as beautiful as those of Goya or Vel&aacute;squez. They
    will put a touch of pink on a black frock, or devise a garment
    of white, yellow and pink, or else green and pink, or else
    <i>blue and yellow</i>, in which there is nothing to be altered
    from the artistic point of view. Seurat would find some very
    picturesque men's figures here in spite of their modern
    clothes.</p>

    <p>Now, as for portraits, I am pretty sure they'd take the
    bait.</p>

    <p>But first before I dare start along that line, I want my
    nerves steadier, and also to be settled in so that I could have
    people in my studio. And if I must tell you roughly what I
    figure it would take to get me quite well and acclimatized for
    good, it will mean a year, and to set me up completely, a cool
    thousand francs. If during the first year - the present year -
    I spend 100 francs on food and 100 francs on this house per
    month, you see there won't be a cent left in the budget for
    painting.</p>

    <p>But at the end of that year I should have a decent
    establishment and my own health to show for it - of that I am
    sure. And in the meantime I should spend my time drawing every
    day, with two or three pictures a month besides.</p>

    <p>In figuring what it would cost to set me up, I am also
    counting in a complete new set of linen and clothes and
    shoes.</p>

    <p>And at the end of the year I should be a different man.</p>

    <p>I should have a home of my own and the peace to get back my
    health.</p>

    <p>(Needless to say, if you have got canvases that take up too
    much room, you can send them here by goods service, and I will
    keep them in the studio here. If this is not yet the case, it
    will be later on, and I am keeping a good many studies which
    don't seem good enough to send to you.)</p>

    <p>And then I can hope not to get exhausted before my time.
    Monticelli was physically stronger than I, I think, and if I
    had the strength for it, I'd live from hand to mouth as he did.
    But if even he was paralyzed, and that without being such a
    tremendous drinker, there'd be precious little hope for me.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I was certainly going the right way for a stroke when I left
    Paris.</label> I paid for it nicely afterward! <label content="psychology.depression">When I stopped drinking,
    when I stopped smoking so much, when I began to think again
    instead of trying not to think - Good Lord, the depression and
    the prostration of it!</label> <label content="health.fatigue">Work in these magnificent natural
    surroundings has restored my morale, but even now some efforts
    are too much for me: my strength fails me.</label> And that was why,
    when I wrote you the other day, I said that if you left the
    Goupils, you would feel healthier in mind, but the cure would
    be very painful. Whereas one does not feel the disease
    itself.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">My poor boy, our neurosis. etc., comes, it's true, from our
    way of living, which is too purely the artist's life, but it is
    also a fatal inheritance, since in civilization the weakness
    increases from generation to generation. If we want to face the
    real truth about our constitution, we must acknowledge that we
    belong to the number of those who suffer from a neurosis which
    already has its roots in the past.</label></p>

    <p>I think Gruby is right about such cases - to eat well, to
    live well, to see little of women, in short to arrange one's
    life in advance exactly as if one were already suffering from a
    disease of the brain and spine, without counting the neurosis
    which is actually there. Certainly that is taking the bull by
    the horns, which is never a bad policy. And Degas did it, and
    succeeded. All the same, don't you feel, as I do, that it is
    frightfully hard? And after all, doesn't it do one all the good
    in the world to listen to the wise advice of Rivet and
    Pangloss, those excellent optimists of the pure and jovial
    Gallic race, who leave you your self-respect?</p>

    <p>However, if we want to live and work, we must be very
    sensible and look after ourselves. Cold water, fresh air,
    simple good food, decent clothes, a decent bed, and no women.
    And not to let oneself go with women, or with life that
    <i>is</i> life, as much as one would like to.</p>

    <p><i>I am not set</i> on sleeping at the studio, but <i>if</i>
    I went to sleep there, it would be because I saw the
    possibility of settling down pretty definitely for a long
    time.</p>

    <p>Now that I need take up no more room in the hotel, seeing
    that I have the studio, I shall beat these people down to 3
    francs a day, whether they like it or not. Consequently there
    is nothing urgent.<label content="lifestyle.clothing"> But if it's all the same to you, send me 100
    francs next time anyway, as I want to get some drawers made,
    just as I have had the shirts and shoes, and must send almost
    all my clothes to be cleaned and mended. Then they will be
    quite all right again. This is urgent in case I have to go to
    Marseilles or see people here. The more precautions we take
    now, the surer we are of being able to hold out in the long
    run, and of getting the work under control.</label></p>

    <p>I have got ten canvases that I'm looking for a case for, and
    I'll send them one of these days.</p>

    <p>A handshake for you, and Koning too. I got a postcard from
    Koning saying that he had had a letter telling him to take back
    the pictures from the Independents' show. Naturally it was the
    only thing to do, and what could I do about it?</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
