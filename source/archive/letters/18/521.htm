    <p>Letter 521<br>
     Arles, 9 August 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Thank you very much for sending me the canvas and paints,
    which have just arrived. This time there was 9.80 fr. carriage
    to pay, so I shan't go and get them out till I get your next
    letter, having no cash at the moment</label>. But we must make sure
    that Tasset, who generally pays the forwarding charges in
    advance and does not fail to note this prepayment on his bill,
    has omitted it this time. In the same way on the last
    consignment but one I paid 5.60 fr., so if forwarding charges
    were put down on the last bill but one, it would be an
    overcharge. If he had made two separate parcels (usually the
    cost of carriage is about 3 francs) we should only have had to
    pay 5.60 fr.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">Provided that on the 10 meters of canvas I paint only
    masterpieces half a meter in size and sell them cash down and
    at exorbitant prices to distinguished connoisseurs of the Rue
    de la Paix, nothing will be easier than to make a fortune on
    this package.</label></p>

    <p>I think it is likely that we are going to have great heat
    now without wind, since the wind has been blowing for six
    weeks. If so, it is a very good thing that I have a supply of
    paints and canvas, because I already have my eye on half a
    dozen subjects, especially that little cottage garden I sent
    you <art id=1456>the drawing of</art> yesterday. I am thinking about Gauguin a
    lot, and I am sure that in one way or another, whether it is he
    who comes here or I who go to him, he and I will like
    practically the same subjects, and I have no doubt that I could
    work at Pont-Aven, and on the other hand I am convinced that he
    would fall in love with the country down here.<label content="business.selling"> Well, by the end
    of the year, supposing he gives you one canvas a month, which
    would make altogether a dozen a year, he will have made a
    profit on it, not having incurred any debts and working
    steadily without interruption; certainly he won't have been the
    loser, as the money which he will have had from us would be
    largely made good by the economies that will be possible if we
    set up house in the studio instead of both of us living in
    caf&eacute;s. Besides that, provided we keep on good terms and
    are determined not to quarrel, we shall be in a stronger
    position as far as reputation goes.</label></p>

    <p>If we each live alone, it means living like madmen or
    criminals, in appearance at any rate, and also a little in
    reality. <label content="food-and-drink.diet">I am happier to feel my old strength returning than I
    ever thought I could be. I owe this largely to the people at
    the restaurant where I have my meals at the moment, who really
    are extraordinary. Certainly I have to pay for it, but it is
    something you don't find in Paris, really getting something to
    eat for your money.</label> And I should very much like to see Gauguin
    here for a good long time.</p>

    <p>What Gruby says about doing without women and eating well is
    true, for if your very brain and marrow are going into your
    work, it is pretty sensible not to exhaust yourself more than
    you must in love-making. But it is easier to put into practice
    in the country than in Paris.</p>

    <p>The desire for women that you catch in Paris, isn't it
    rather the effect of that very enervation which Gruby is the
    sworn enemy of than a sign of vigour? So you feel this desire
    disappearing at the very moment you are yourself again. The
    root of the evil lies in the constitution itself, in the fatal
    weakening of families from generation to generation, and
    besides that, in one's unwholesome job and the dreary life in
    Paris. The root of the evil certainly lies there, and there's
    no cure for it.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">I think that when the day comes for you to free yourself of
    those futile accounts and the absurdly complicated management
    at Goupil's, you would gain enormously in influence with the
    collectors; these complicated systems of management are the
    very devil, and I think that no brain exists, no temperament,
    whoever the man on the job is, that does not lose 50 per cent
    over it. Our uncle was quite right in what he said about it:
    much business with few employees and not little business with a
    lot of them. Unluckily for him he was himself caught in the
    wheels.</label></p>

    <p>This job of working among people so as to make sales is a job that requires observation and
    coolness. But if you are forced to give too much attention to the books, you lose your poise.</p>

    <p>I do want to know exactly how you are. Anyway, provided the
    impressionists produce good stuff and make friends, there is
    always the chance and the possibility of a more independent
    position for you later on. It's a pity that it cannot be from
    now on. No letter from Russell yet, but now that he has got the
    drawings, he is bound to reply. This restaurant where I am is
    very queer; it is grey all over; the floor is of grey bitumen
    like a street pavement, grey paper on the walls, green blinds
    always drawn, a big green curtain in front of the door which is
    always open, to stop the dust coming in. So it already has a
    Vel&aacute;squez grey&mdash;like in the &ldquo;Spinning
    Women&rdquo;&mdash; and even the very narrow, very fierce ray
    of sunlight through a blind, like the one that slants across
    Vel&aacute;squez's picture, is not wanting. Little tables of
    course, with white cloths. And behind this room in
    Vel&aacute;squez grey you see the old kitchen, as clean as a
    Dutch kitchen, with floor of bright red bricks, green
    vegetables, oak chest, the kitchen range with shining brass
    things and blue and white tiles, and the big fire a clear
    orange. And then there are two women waitresses, both in grey,
    a little like that picture of Prevost's you have in your place
    - you could compare it point for point.</p>

    <p>In the kitchen, an old woman and a short, fat servant also
    in grey, black, white. I don't know if I describe it clearly
    enough for you, but it's here, and it's pure
    Vel&aacute;squez.</p>

    <p>In front of the restaurant there is a covered court, paved
    with red brick, and on the walls wild vine, convolvulus and
    creepers.[Vincent is describing the Restaurant Venissac at 28 Place Lamartine.]</p>

    <p>It is still the real old Proven&ccedil;al, whereas the other
    restaurants are so much modeled on Paris that even when they
    have no kind of concierge whatever, there's his lodge just the
    same and the notice &ldquo;Apply to the Concierge!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It isn't all brilliant here. I saw a stable with four
    coffee-coloured cows, and a calf of the same colour. The stable
    bluish-white hung with spiders' webs, the cows very clean and
    very beautiful, and a great green curtain in the doorway to
    keep out flies and dust.</p>

    <p>Grey again - Vel&aacute;squez's grey.</p>

    <p>There was such quiet in it - the cafe-au-lait and tobacco
    colours of the cows' hides, with the soft bluish grey-white of
    the walls, the green hanging and the sparkling sunny
    golden-green outside to make a startling contrast. So you see
    there's something still to be done, quite different from
    anything I have done so far.</p>

    <p>I must go to work. I saw another very quiet and lovely thing
    the other day, a girl with a coffee-tinted skin, if I remember
    correctly, ash-blonde hair, grey eyes, a print bodice of pale
    pink under which you could see the breasts, shapely, firm and
    small. This against the emerald leaves of some fig trees. A
    woman as simple as the herds, every line of her virgin.</p>

    <p>It isn't altogether impossible that I shall get her to pose
    in the open air, and her mother too - a gardener's wife - earth
    colour, dressed just then in soiled yellow and faded blue.</p>

    <p>The girl's coffee-tinted complexion was darker than the pink
    of her bodice.</p>

    <p>The mother was amazing, the figure in dirty yellow and faded
    blue standing out in strong sunlight against a square of
    brilliant snow-white and citron-yellow flowers. A perfect Van
    der Meer of Delft, you see.</p>

    <p>It's not a bad place, the South.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
