    <p>Letter 554<br>
     Arles, 16 October 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>At last I can send you a little sketch to give you
    at least an idea of the way the work is shaping up. For today I
    am all right again.<label content="health.eyes"> My eyes are still tired</label> but then I had
    a new idea in my head and here is the sketch of it. Another size 30
    canvas.<art id=0482> This time it's just simply my bedroom</art>,
    only here colour is to do everything, and giving by its
    simplification a grander style to things, is to be suggestive
    here of <i>rest</i> or of sleep in general. In a word, looking
    at the picture ought to rest the brain, or rather the
    imagination.</p>

    <p>The walls are pale violet. The floor is of red tiles.</p>

    <p>The wood of the bed and chairs is the yellow of fresh
    butter, the sheets and pillows very light greenish-citron.</p>

    <p>The coverlet scarlet. The window green.</p>

    <p>The toilet table orange, the basin blue.</p>

    <p>The doors lilac.</p>

    <p>And that is all - there is nothing in this room with its
    closed shutters.</p>

    <p>The squareness of the furniture again must express
    inviolable rest. Portraits on the walls, and a mirror and a
    towel and some clothes.</p>

    <p>The frame - as there is no white in the picture - will be
    white.</p>

    <p>This by way of revenge for the enforced rest I was obliged
    to take.</p>

    <p>I shall work on it again all day, but you see how simple the
    conception is. The shadows and the cast shadows are suppressed;
    it is painted in free flat tints like the Japanese prints. It
    is going to be a contrast to, for instance, the Tarascon
    diligence and the night caf&eacute;.</p>

    <p>I am not writing you a long letter, because tomorrow very
    early I am going to begin in the cool morning light, so as to
    finish my canvas.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">How are the pains - don't forget to tell me about them.</label></p>

    <p>I know that you will write one of these days.</p>

    <p>I will make you sketches of the other rooms too someday.</p>

    <p>With a good handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
