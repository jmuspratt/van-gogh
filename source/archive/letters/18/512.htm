  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter, which gave me great pleasure,
    <label content="health.fatigue">arriving just exactly at the moment when I was still dazed with
    the sun and the strain of wrestling with a rather big
    canvas.</label></p>

    <p>I have <art id=1455>a new drawing of a garden full of flowers</art>, and two painted studies
    as well.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I must send you a new order for paints and canvas, rather a
    heavy one. Only it is not at all urgent. What really might be
    urgent is the canvas, because I have a batch of stretchers that
    I have taken the studies out of, and I ought to be putting new
    canvas on them between times.</label></p>

    <p><?showImage("625_V-T_5120");?>
    </p>

    <p>You will see from this sketch the subject of the new
    studies. There is <art id=0430>one vertical</art> and <art id=0429>another
    horizontal</art> of the same subject, size 30 canvases.
    There really is a subject for a picture in it, as in other
    studies that I have. And I truly can't tell if I shall ever
    paint pictures that are peaceful and quietly worked out, for it
    seems to me it will always be headlong.</p>

    <p>Have you had any news of Gauguin? I wrote him myself last
    week to ask how his health was and how the work was going. No
    reply from Russell, who cannot be in Paris according to what
    McKnight says; he has returned with Bock. Still a frosty
    silence about my work when they come.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">It is true enough what you say about Prinsenhage, that it's
    the same story all over again, but when at long last the good
    soul isn't there any more, it will be one more gap and
    desolation for our small circle. And indeed, we shall feel it
    ourselves, for there is something poignant in having been
    influenced by him. And then to see someone whom you have always
    seen on the go reduced to such a condition of suspicious
    helplessness and continual suffering, it certainly doesn't give
    one a pleasant or cheery idea of human existence or heighten
    one's zest for life. Our mother in Breda must be getting very
    old too. Involuntarily - is it the effect of this Ruysdael
    country? - I keep thinking of Holland, and across the twofold
    remoteness of distance and time gone by these memories have a
    kind of heartbreak in them.</label></p>

    <p>What you write about Reid isn't very cheering either. At
    times he would talk so much about turning painter and going off
    to an aunt in the country that it is just possible he may be in
    the act of carrying this plan out. What does Maria say? but
    perhaps she has disappeared too.</p>

    <p>All the same, I think that the continual wind here must have
    something to do with the haggard look the painted studies have.
    Because you see it in C&eacute;zanne too.</p>

    <p>What must make it easy for the Japanese to cram their works
    of art into drawers and cupboards is that the kakemonos can be
    rolled up, but our paintings cannot, for they would end up by
    scaling off. Nothing would help us to sell our canvases more
    than if they could gain general acceptance as decorations for
    middle-class houses. The way it used to be in Holland.</p>

    <p>Down here in the South it would do one's heart good to see
    pictures on the white walls. But go and look - everywhere great
    coloured Julien medallions - horrors. And alas, we can do
    nothing to change this state of affairs.</p>

    <p>However - there are the caf&eacute;s - perhaps later on
    we'll get to decorate them.</p>

    <p>Good-by for now - with a handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
