  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">What you write about your visits to Gruby has distressed me,
    but all the same I am relieved that you went. Has it occurred
    to you that the dazedness - the feeling of extreme lassitude -
    may have been caused by this weakness of the heart, and in this
    case the iodide of potassium would have nothing to do with the
    feeling of collapse?</label> <label content="health.fatigue">Remember how last winter I was stupefied
    to the point of being absolutely incapable of doing anything at
    all, except a little painting, although I was not taking any
    iodide of potassium.</label> So if I were you, I should have it out
    with Rivet if Gruby tells you not to take any. I am sure that
    in any case you mean to keep on being friends with both.</p>

    <p>I often think of Gruby <i>here</i> and <i>now</i>, and I am
    completely well, but it is having pure air and warmth that
    makes it possible. In all that racket and bad air of Paris,
    Rivet takes things as they are, without trying to create a
    paradise, and without in any way trying to make us perfect. But
    he forges a cuirass, or rather he hardens one against illness,
    and keeps up one's morale. I do believe, by making light of the
    disease one has got. If only you could have one year of life in
    the country and with nature just now, it would make Gruby's
    cure much easier. I expect he will make you promise to have
    nothing to do with women except in case of necessity, but
    anyhow as little as possible.</p>

    <p>Now as for me, I am doing very well down here, but it is
    because I have my work here, and nature, and if I didn't have
    that, I should grow melancholy. If work had any attraction for
    you where you are, and if the impressionists were getting on,
    it would be a very good thing. For loneliness, worries,
    difficulties, the unsatisfied need for kindness and sympathy -
    that is what is hard to bear, the mental suffering of sadness
    or disappointment undermines us more than dissipation - us, I
    say, who find ourselves the happy possessors of disordered
    hearts.</p>

    <p>I believe iodide of potassium purifies the blood and the
    whole system, doesn't it? And can you do without it? Anyway you
    must have it out frankly with Rivet; he oughtn't to be
    jealous.</p>

    <p>I wish you had company more roughly, warmly alive than the
    Dutch. All the same, Koning with his caprices is an exception,
    better than most. And it is always a good thing to have
    someone. But I should like you to have had some friends among
    the French as well.</p>

    <p>Will you do something which will give me great pleasure? My
    Danish friend who is leaving for Paris on Tuesday will give you
    two little pictures, nothing much, which I should like to give
    to Mme. la Contesse de la Boissi&egrave;re at Asni&egrave;res.
    She lives in the Boulevard Voltaire, on the first floor of the
    first house, at the end of the Pont de Clichy. Old Perruchot's
    restaurant is on the ground floor.</p>

    <p>Would you care to take them there for me in person, and say
    that I had hoped to see her again this spring, and that I have
    not forgotten her; I gave them two little ones last year, her
    and her daughter.</p>

    <p>I hope that you will not regret making these ladies'
    acquaintance, for it is really a <i>family</i>. The countess is
    far from young, but she is countess first and then a
    <i>lady</i>, the daughter the same.</p>

    <p>And it would be wiser for you to go, since I cannot be sure
    that the family will stay at the same place this year (though
    they have been coming there for several years, and Perruchot
    should know their address in town). Perhaps it is an illusion
    of mine, but I cannot help thinking of it, and perhaps it would
    give pleasure both to them and to you if you met them.</p>

    <p>Look here, I will do my best to send you some new drawings
    for Dordrecht.</p>

    <p>I have done two still lifes this week.</p>

    <p><?showImage("591_V-T_4890");?>
    </p>

    <p><art id=0410>A blue enamel coffeepot, a cup (on the left), royal blue and
    gold, a milk jug in squares of pale blue and white, a cup - on
    the right - of white with a blue and orange pattern, on an
    earthen tray of grayish yellow, a jug in earthenware or Majolica, blue with a pattern in
    reds, greens and browns, and lastly 2 oranges and 3 lemons; the table is covered with a
    blue cloth, the background is greenish-yellow, so that there
    are six different blues and four or five yellows and oranges</art>.</p>

    <p><art id=0600>The other still life is the majolica pot with wild flowers</art>.</p>

    <p>Thank you very much for your letter and the 50-Fr. note. I
    hope the case will arrive soon. Next time I think I shall take
    the canvases off the stretchers, so as to send them rolled up
    by passenger train.</p>

    <p>I think you will soon be friends with this Dane; he doesn't
    do anything much, but he has intelligence and feeling, and he
    probably didn't start painting such a long time ago. Take a
    Sunday sometime to get to know him.</p>

    <p>As for me, I am feeling infinitely better, blood circulation
    good and my stomach digesting.<label content="food-and-drink.preference"> I have found a place
    where the food is very, very good, and the result is immediately apparent.</label></p>

    <p>Did you notice Gruby's face when he shuts his mouth tight
    and says - &ldquo;No women!&rdquo;? It would make a fine Degas,
    that. But there is no answering back, for when you have to work
    all day with your brain, calculating, considering, planning,
    you've had as much as your nerves can stand.</p>

    <p>So go out now and meet women socially; you'll find that
    you'll get on swimmingly - artists and all that. That's how it
    will turn out, you'll see. And you won't miss much by doing it,
    you know.</p>

    <p>I have not yet been able to do business with the furniture
    dealer. I have seen a bed, but it was dearer than I expected. I
    feel that I must polish off some more work before spending more
    on furnishing. I have my room for 1 Fr. per night. I have
    bought some more linen, and some paints too. I took very strong
    linen.</p>

    <p>Bit by bit as my blood quickens, the thought of success
    quickens too. I should not be greatly surprised if your illness
    were also a reaction from that terrible winter, which has
    lasted an eternity. And then it will be the same story as mine,
    get as much of the spring air as possible, go to bed <i>very
    early</i>, because you must have sleep, and as for food, plenty
    of fresh vegetables, and no <i>bad</i> wine or <i>bad</i>
    alcohol. And very little of women, and <i>lots of
    patience</i>.</p>

    <p>It doesn't matter if you don't shake it off at once. Gruby
    will give you a strengthening diet of meat now, you being where
    you are. Here I could not take much, and it is not necessary
    here. It is precisely that sense of stupefaction that I'm
    getting rid of. I do not feel so much need of distraction, I am
    less harassed by my passions, and I can work more calmly, I
    could be alone without getting bored. I have come through
    rather older in the way I look at things, but no sadder.</p>

    <p>I shall not believe you if in your next letter you tell me
    there's nothing wrong with you. It is perhaps a more serious
    change, and I should not be surprised if you were a trifle low
    during the time it will take you to recover. In the fullness of
    artistic life there is, and remains, and will always come back
    at times, that homesick longing for the truly ideal life that
    can never come true.</p>

    <p>And sometimes you lack all desire to throw yourself heart
    and soul into art, and to get well for that. You know you are a
    cab horse and that it's the same old cab you'll be hitched up
    to again: that you'd rather live in a meadow with the sun, a
    river and other horses for company, likewise free, and the act
    of procreation.</p>

    <p>And perhaps, to get to the bottom of it, the disease of the
    heart is caused by this; it would not surprise me. One does not
    rebel against things, nor is one resigned to them; one's ill
    because of them, and one does not get better, and it's hard to
    be precise about the cure.</p>

    <p>I do not know who it was who called this condition - being
    struck by death and immortality. The cab you drag along must be
    of some use to people you do not know. And so, if we believe in
    the new art and in the artists of the future, our faith does
    not cheat us. When good old Corot said a few days before his
    death - &ldquo;Last night in a dream I saw landscapes with
    skies all pink,&rdquo; well, haven't they come, those skies all
    pink, and yellow and green into the bargain, in the
    impressionist landscapes? All of which means that there are
    things one feels coming, and they are coming in very truth.</p>

    <p>And as for us who are not, I am inclined to believe, nearly
    so close to death, we nevertheless feel that this thing is
    greater than we are, and that its life is of longer duration
    than ours.</p>

    <p>We do not feel we are dying, but we do feel the truth that
    we are of small account, and that we are paying a hard price to
    be a link in the chain of artists, in health, in youth, in
    liberty, none of which we enjoy, any more than the cab horse
    that hauls a coachful of people out to enjoy the spring.</p>

    <p>So what I wish for you, as for myself, is to succeed in
    getting back your health, because you must have that. That
    &ldquo;Esp&eacute;rance&rdquo; by Puvis de Chavannes is so
    true. There is an art of the future, and it is going to be so
    lovely and so young that even if we give up our youth for it,
    we must gain in serenity by it. Perhaps it is very silly to
    write all this, but I feel it so strongly; it seems to me that,
    like me, you have been suffering to see your youth pass away
    like a puff of smoke; but if it grows again, and comes to life
    in what you make, nothing has been lost, and the power to work
    is another youth. Take some pains then to get well, for we
    shall need your health.</p>

    <p>A handshake for you and the same for Koning.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
