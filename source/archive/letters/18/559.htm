  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Gauguin and I thank you very much for the 100 Fr. you sent
    and also for your letter.</p>

    <p>Gauguin is very pleased that you like what he sent from
    Brittany, and that other people who have seen them like them
    too.</p>

    <p>Just now he has in hand some women in a vineyard, altogether
    from memory, but if he does not spoil it or leave it unfinished
    it will be very fine and very unusual. Also a picture of the
    same night cafe that I painted too.</p>

    <p>I have done two canvases of falling leaves, which Gauguin
    liked, I think, and I'm working now on <art id=0495>a vineyard all purple
    and yellow</art>.</p>

    <p>Then I have <art id=0489>an Arl&eacute;sienne at last, a figure (size 30
    Canvas) slashed on in an hour, background pale lemon, the face
    grey, the clothes black, deep black, with unmixed Prussian
    blue. She is leaning on a green table and seated in an armchair
    of orange wood</art>.</p>

    <p>Gauguin has bought a chest of drawers for the house, and
    various household utensils, also 20 metres of very strong
    canvas, and a lot of things that we needed, and that at any
    rate it was more convenient to have.</p>

    <p>Only we have kept an account of all he has paid out, which
    comes almost to 100 francs, so that either at the New Year or
    say in March we can pay him back, and then the chest of drawers
    etc. will naturally be ours.</p>

    <p>I think this is right on the whole, since he intends to put
    money by when he sells, till the time (say in a year) when he
    has enough to risk a second voyage to Martinique.</p>

    <p>We are working hard, and our life together goes very well. I
    am very glad to know that you are not alone in the flat. These
    drawings by de Haan are <i>very fine</i>. I like them very
    much. Yet to do that with colour, to manage so much expression
    without the help of chiaroscuro in black and white, damn it
    all, it is not easy.</p>

    <p>And he will even arrive at a new <i>type of drawing</i> if
    he carries out his plan of passing through impressionism <i>at
    a school</i>, considering his new attempts in colour merely as
    studies. But in my opinion he is right over and over again to
    do all this.</p>

    <p>Only there are several so-called impressionists who have not
    his knowledge of the figure, and it is just this knowledge of
    the figure which will later on come again to the surface, and
    which he will be all the better for. I am very anxious some day
    to get to know de Haan and Isa&auml;cson. If they ever came
    here Gauguin would certainly say to them - go to Java for
    impressionist work. For Gauguin though he works hard here is
    still homesick for hot countries. And then it is unquestionable
    that if you went to Java, for instance, with the one idea of
    working on colour, you would see heaps of new things. Then in
    those brighter countries, with a stronger sun, direct shadow,
    as well as the cast shadow of objects and figures, becomes
    quite different, and is so full of colour that one is tempted
    simply to suppress it. That happens even here. Yet I will say
    no more on the importance of painting in the tropics, I am
    already sure de Haan and Isa&auml;cson will feel the importance
    of it.</p>

    <p>In any case, to come here some time or other would do them
    no harm, they would certainly find some interesting things.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.diet">Gauguin and I are going to have our dinner at home today,
    and we feel as sure and certain that it will turn out well as
    that it will seem to us better or cheaper.</label></p>

    <p>So as not to delay this letter I will finish up for today. I
    hope to write again soon. Your arrangement about money is quite
    right.</p>

    <p>I think you will like the fall of the leaves that I have
    done.</p>

    <p><art id=0486>It is some poplar trunks in lilac cut by the frame where the
    leaves begin.</p>

    <p>These tree-trunks are lined like pillars along an avenue
    where to right and left there are rows of old Roman tombs of a
    blue lilac. And then the soil is covered, as with a carpet, by
    a thick layer of yellow and orange fallen leaves. And they are
    still falling like flakes of snow. And in the avenue little
    black figures of lovers. The upper part of the picture is a
    bright green meadow, and no sky or almost none</art>.</p>

    <p><art id=0487>The second canvas is the same avenue but with an old fellow
    and a woman as fat and round as a ball</art>.</p>

    <p>But if only you had been with us on Sunday, when we saw<art id=0495> a
    red vineyard, all red like red wine. In the distance it turned
    to yellow, and then a green sky with the sun, the earth after
    the rain violet, sparkling yellow here and there where it
    caught the reflection of the setting sun.</art></p>

    <p>A handshake in thought from both of us, good bye for the
    present. I will write again as soon as I can, and to our
    Dutchmen too. [The two artists staying with Theo.]</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
