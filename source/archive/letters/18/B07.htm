  <body>
    <p>My dear Bernard,</p>

    <p>Forgive me for writing in haste, I'm afraid my letter will
    be illegible, but I did want to reply at once.</p>

    <p>Do you realize that we have been very stupid, Gauguin, you
    and I, in not going to the same place? But when Gauguin left, I
    still wasn't sure if I could get away, and when you left, that
    awful money business, and the bad reports I sent you about the
    cost of living here, stopped you from coming.</p>

    <p>It wouldn't have been such a stupid thing to do if we had
    all gone to Arles together, for with three of us here, we could
    have done our own housekeeping. And now that I have found my
    bearings a bit more, I am beginning to discover the advantages.
    For my part, I'm getting on better here than I did in the
    north. I even work right in the middle of the day, in the full
    sun, with no shade at all, out in the wheat fields, and lo and
    behold, I am as happy as a cicada. My God, if only I had known
    this country at 25 instead of coming here at 35! At that time I
    was fascinated by grey, or rather lack of colour. I kept
    dreaming of Millet, and then I also had such acquaintances
    among the Dutch painters as Mauve, Isra&euml;ls, etc.</p>

    <p>[<art id=608_V-B_B070>Here Vincent drew a sketch of the Sower.</art>]</p>

    <p>Here is a sketch of a sower: <art id=0422>a large piece of land with clods
    of ploughed earth, for the most part a definite purple. A field
    of ripe wheat, in yellow ochre with a little carmine</art>.</p>

    <p>The sky chrome yellow, almost as bright as the sun itself,
    which is chrome yellow 1 with a little white, while the rest of
    the sky is chrome yellow 1 and 2 mixed. Thus very yellow.</p>

    <p>The Sower's smock is blue and his trousers white.</p>

    <p>Size 25 canvas, square.</p>

    <p>There are many touches of yellow in the soil, neutral tones
    produced by mixing purple with the yellow, but I couldn't care
    less what the colours are in <i>reality</i>. I'd sooner do
    those na&iuml;ve pictures out of old almanacs, old farmers'
    almanacs where hail, snow, rain or fine weather are depicted in
    a wholly primitive manner, like the one Anquetin used so
    successfully in his Moisson. <sup>1</sup> To he honest with
    you, I have absolutely no objection to the countryside, since I
    grew up in it - I am still enchanted by snatches of the past,
    have a hankering after the eternal, of which the sower and the
    sheaf of corn are the symbols. But when shall I ever get round
    to doing the <i>starry sky</i>, that picture which is always in
    my mind?</p>

    <p>Alas, alas, it is just as the excellent fellow Cyprien says
    in J. K. Huysman's &ldquo;En m&eacute;nage&rdquo;: the most
    beautiful paintings are those which you dream about when you
    lie in bed smoking a pipe, but which you never paint.</p>

    <p>Yet you have to make a start, no matter how incompetent you
    feel in the face of inexpressible perfection, of the
    overwhelming beauty of nature.</p>

    <p>How I should like to see the study you have done of the
    brothel!</p>

    <p>I am always reproaching myself for not having done any
    figures here yet.</p>

    <p>[<art id=608_V-B_B071>Sketch of Summer Evening drawn here.</art>]</p>

    <p>Herewith <art id=0465>another landscape. Setting sun? Rising moon?</p>

    <p>A summer evening, anyway.</p>

    <p>Town purple, celestial body yellow, sky green-blue. The
    wheat has all the hues of old gold, copper, green-gold or
    red-gold, yellow-gold, yellow-bronze, red-green. Size 30
    canvas, square</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I painted it at the height of the mistral. My easel was
    fixed in the ground with iron pegs, a method I recommend to
    you. You push the legs of the easel deep into the ground, then
    drive iron pegs fifty centimetres long into the ground beside
    them. [See above sketch.] You tie the whole lot together with
    rope. This way you can work in the wind.</label></p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">This is what I wanted to say about black and white. Take the
    Sower. The picture is divided in two; one half is yellow, the
    upper part, the lower part is purple. Well, the white trousers
    help rest the eye and distract it just as the excessive
    contrast of yellow and purple starts to jar. There you are,
    that's what I wanted to say.</label></p>

    <p>I know a second lieutenant in the Zouaves here; his name is
    Milliet. I give him drawing lessons - with my perspective frame
    - and he is beginning to do some drawings and, honestly, I've
    seen far worse. He is keen to learn, has been in Tonkin,
    etc&hellip; He is leaving for Africa in October. If you were to
    join the Zouaves, he would take you along and guarantee you a
    fairly large measure of freedom to paint, at least if you were
    willing to help him with his artistic plans. Might this be of
    any use to you? If so, let me know as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>One reason for working is that the canvases are worth money.
    Since you doubt that, you may call this reason fairly prosaic.
    But it is true. One reason for not working is that canvases and
    paint simply swallow up our money while they are waiting to be
    sold.</p>

    <p>Drawings, on the other hand, don't cost a lot.</p>

    <p>Gauguin too is bored at Pont-Aven, complains just like you
    of his isolation. If only you could go and see him! But I
    haven't any idea whether he means to stay, and I'm inclined to
    think he's planning to go to Paris. He told me he thought you
    would come to Pont-Aven. My God, if only all three of us were
    here! You will say that it's too out of the way. All right,
    <i>but think of the winter</i>, for here you can work all year
    round. <label content="health.general">The reason why I love this country is that I have less
    to fear from the cold, which, because it stops my blood
    circulating properly, makes it impossible for me to think or
    even do anything at all.</label></p>

    <p>You will see that for yourself when you are a soldier. Then
    your melancholy will be gone, which could easily be the result
    of your having too little or the wrong blood, which I don't
    really think is the case.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.diet">It's the fault of that damned foul wine in Paris and those
    foul greasy steaks.</label></p>

    <p><label content="health.general">My God, I had reached the point where my blood was no longer
    circulating at all, literally no longer at all. But after four
    weeks it has started to circulate again.</label><label content="psychology.depression">
    However, my dear friend, at the same time I have had, just like you, a fit of
    melancholy, from which I would have suffered as much as you,
    had I not welcomed it with great pleasure as a sign that I was
    recovering - which is indeed what happened.</label></p>

    <p>So, don't go back to Paris but stay in the countryside, for
    you will need your strength to come through the trial of
    serving in Africa. Well then, the more blood you produce
    beforehand, good blood, the better it will be, for over there
    in the heat you may not be able to do it quite so easily.</p>

    <p>Painting and fucking a lot don't go together, it softens the
    brain. Which is a bloody nuisance.</p>

    <p>The symbol of St. Luke, the patron saint of painters, is, as
    you know, an ox. So you just be patient as an ox if you want to
    work in the artistic field. Still, bulls are lucky not to have
    to work at that foul business of painting.</p>

    <p>But what I wanted to say is this: after the period of
    melancholy is over you will be stronger than before, you will
    recover your health, and you will find the scenery round you so
    beautiful that you will want to do nothing but paint.</p>

    <p>I think that your poetry will change in the same way as your
    painting. After a few eccentric things, you have succeeded in
    doing some with Egyptian calm and a great simplicity.</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    &ldquo;Que l'heure est donc br&egrave;ve<br>

    Qu'on passe en aimant,<br>

    C'est moins qu'un instant,<br>

    Un peu plus qu'un r&ecirc;ve.<br>

    Le temps nous enl&egrave;ve<br>

    Notre enchantement.&rdquo;<br>

    <p></p>

    [How short, then, the hour<br>

    One spends in loving,<br>

    It is less than an instant,<br>

    Little more than a dream.<br>

    Time strips us of<br>

    Our enchantment.]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>That's not by Baudelaire, I don't know who wrote it. They're
    the words of a song found in Daudet's Nabab - that's where I
    took it from - but doesn't it express the idea just like a
    shrug of the shoulders from a real lady?</p>

    <p>The other day I read Loti's Madame Chrysanth&egrave;me, it
    includes interesting details about Japan.</p>

    <p>My brother is holding a Claude Monet exhibition at the
    moment which I should very much like to see. Guy de Maupassant
    among others came to have a look, and said that he'll be coming
    often to the Boulevard Montmartre in the future.</p>

    <p>I must go and paint, so I'll stop; I'll probably write again
    soon. A thousand apologies for my not putting enough stamps on
    that letter, even though I stuck them on at the post office,
    nor is this the first time that it has happened here that,
    being in doubt and enquiring at the counter, I have been given
    the wrong information about the postage. You have no idea of
    the indifference, the unconcern of the people here. Anyway,
    you'll soon be seeing all that with your own eyes, in Africa.
    Thanks for your letter, I hope to write again soon, at a moment
    when I'm in less of a rush.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
