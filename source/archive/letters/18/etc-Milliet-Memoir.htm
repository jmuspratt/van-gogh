    <p>From Les Lettres Fran&ccedil;aises</p>

    <p>By Pierre Weiller, 24 - 31 March 1955</p>

    <p>Paul-Eug&eacute;ne Milliet was a 2<sup>nd</sup>
    lieutenant of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Zouave Regiment of Light
    Infantry. He died during the 2<sup>nd</sup> World War. These
    memoirs were recorded almost 20 years before they were
    published.</p>

    <p>Several times, at his home, or at mine, while drinking a cup
    of coffee chased by a large glassful of rum, he insisted on the
    privilege, the necessity and on the pre-eminence of drawing.
    Although he was cultured to a certain degree, that he was
    interested in all that is beautiful, I remained surprised by
    the clarity of the interest that he possessed on an art which
    few appreciate. One day when he was particularly resolute, he
    confessed to me that he had, in his youth, toyed with the
    pencil, pen and charcoal. &ldquo;As an amateur, dear friend, as
    an amateur, because I have always been a soldier, a soldier, a
    combatant, and a Bl&eacute;dard <sup>1</sup>. I told you
    that I had not often had the opportunity to sketch. And also I
    have had, at one point in my life, a drawing teacher, one whose
    name is great, and who gave me some lessons during a leave,
    between two campaigns.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And he told me his name, as always half obscured by grunts
    and humming of a disputable taste but incontestably
    picturesque. I vaguely understood a surname resembling
    &ldquo;vogue,&rdquo; but I did not ask him to elucidate. This
    was only later that I realized that &ldquo;vogue&rdquo; could,
    possibly, mean Van Gogh.</p>

    <p>But it appeared so improbable that I waited for a while
    before I asked him precisely.</p>

    <p>During a later meeting, I posed the question.</p>

    <p>- But yes, replied the colonel, certainly it was Van Gogh
    who was my drawing teacher. No worse than any other, elsewhere,
    and certainly a better designer that all the eccentrics that
    labour for you. But mark you, if he was my drawing teacher, I
    would never have taken him as my painting teacher.</p>

    <p>- But in what period did you know him?</p>

    <p>- In 1888.</p>

    <p>- And where was this?</p>

    <p>- In Arles where he stayed after having left Paris. Myself,
    I took some rest in this city, between two campaigns.</p>

    <p>-Could you give me some details on him, on his behavior?</p>

    <p>- Certainly. He was a curious fellow. A bit of a hot-head,
    like a Bl&eacute;dard. But he wasn't one: no inclination
    for military art, none. An artist?</p>

    <p>Obviously, an artist, and he drew in an admirable manner. A
    charming companion, when he decided, which took him several
    days. We often took wonderful walks in the vicinity of Arles
    and, in the countryside, we sketched. Sometimes, he took along
    a canvas and began to daub on it. Doing that, he didn't do
    well. This boy, who had the taste and the talent for drawing,
    became abnormal as soon as he touched a brush.</p>

    <p>- You consider that he drew well. Nevertheless you are not
    going to make me believe that he painted as an apprentice or an
    amateur.</p>

    <p>- He painted like a headquarters officer.</p>

    <p>- My dear colonel, all art lovers and all art critics, all
    connoisseurs recognize that Van Gogh&hellip;</p>

    <p>- Talents that he didn't have. I am in a better position
    that most to know. I have seen him work. I have benefited from
    his teaching. I have even given him lessons. Lessons in
    drawing, of course, because we went out especially in the
    countryside, to each make a sketch of the same landscape and to
    mutually correct ourselves, independently. Ah well, Van Gogh
    sometimes found my remarks justified. Sometimes, not always.
    And only concerning drawings. Because, as soon as he started to
    paint, or I withdrew, or I refused to give a good opinion, we
    argued.<label content="health.mental"> He was not an easy character and when he was angry, he
    appeared insane. Only, it hardly impressed me: because in my
    wandering soldier life, I had seen it all before.</label></p>

    <p>- But what do you criticize of Van Gogh's works?</p>

    <p>- What I criticize is that they are not drawn. He painted
    too large, he gave no attention to details, he did not draw,
    what&hellip; And meanwhile, when he wanted to, he knew how to
    draw, I tell you. He replaced the drawing by colours:
    meaningless, because the colour completes the drawing, but can
    not hold it in place. The drawing is the support of the colour.
    And then his colour&hellip;extreme, abnormal, inadmissible. The
    tones too hot, too violent, not capable of self control. You
    see, my friend, the painter has to make a painting with love,
    with passion. A canvas has to be &ldquo;caressed&rdquo;: Van
    Gogh, he raped it. At times, he was a real brute, a
    &ldquo;tough&rdquo;, as they say.</p>

    <p>- His character was choleric therefore?</p>

    <p>- Yes and no. Rather agreeable, on the whole, but very
    changeable. Very nervous. Furious, when I voiced a criticism on
    a painting. But that did not last and we always finished up
    reconciled.</p>

    <p>- If I understand you properly, he was very nervous, but too
    sensitive.</p>

    <p>- An exaggerated sensitivity. Reactions of a woman,
    sometimes. The conscience to be a great artist. He had
    faith. Faith in his talent, a faith a little blind. Proud.
    His health did not appear very strong to me. But, all in all, a
    good comrade, not a bad sort.</p>

    <p>- <label content="health.gastrointestinal">Aside from his nervousness, did you have the impression
    that he was sick?</p>

    <p>- He complained from time to time of his stomach. That is
    all.</label></p>

    <p>- What did he paint during the period where you were with
    him?</p>

    <p>- A little of everything. Landscapes especially, still
    lifes, especially of flowers. Some portraits, including
    mine.</p>

    <p>- How did Van Gogh do your portrait? Where is it
    located?</p>

    <p>- I am not sure. Someone told me that it was in a museum. In
    Holland, I believe.</p>

    <p>- And how were you painted?</p>

    <p>- <art id=0473>In the uniform of an officer of the Zouaves.</art> I had come
    back from Tonkin, don't forget.</p>

    <p>- Do you remember posing?</p>

    <p>- I should say. But it hardly amused me. This is not in my
    character, you understand. As much as I remember, it did not
    last very long. All in all, it wasn't planned out, therefore it
    took little time, relatively, to the artist.</p>

    <p>- Was the portrait much of a likeness?</p>

    <p>- Very. Very much a likeness. But with a deep blue uniform,
    not very well done.</p>

    <p>Such were, faithfully related, some thoughts that my friend
    Milliet gave me on his relationship with Van Gogh. How odd that
    he met this artist, in full possession of his talent, when this
    young officer came to the Midi to take some rest after a hard
    campaign! What a coincidence that they had the same love of
    drawing, these two men so different from each other! And how
    can you not excuse, on the part of the brave colonel, the
    severe criticism that he spoke of a painting that he could not
    understand, and that others of his time especially, little
    approved... His brave policeman father had given him only a
    modest artistic education and I am sure that, as a military
    child, he received little understanding on the art of painting.
    Above all, the reflections of my friend, intransigent as they
    were, have no other value that they were sincere. And the glory
    of Van Gogh is not lost&hellip;</p>
