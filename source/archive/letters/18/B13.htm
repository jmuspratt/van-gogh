  <body>
    <p>My dear comrade Bernard,</p>

    <p>I don't have the slightest doubt that you'll admit that
    neither you nor I can have a complete idea of Vel&aacute;squez
    and Goya, of what they were as men and as painters, for neither
    of us has seen Spain, their country, and so many beautiful
    things which are still left in the South. But what one knows of
    them is already something nevertheless.</p>

    <p>Of course as for the people of the North, Rembrandt first of
    all, it is highly desirable, when judging these painters, to
    know their work as a whole as well as their country, and also
    the somewhat intimate and concise history of the period and of
    the customs of the old country.</p>

    <p>I emphatically repeat that neither Baudelaire nor you has a
    sufficiently clear idea of Rembrandt.</p>

    <p>As for you, I cannot encourage you strongly enough to spend
    a long time looking at the great and minor Dutchmen before
    forming a fixed opinion. It is not merely a question of gems,
    but a question of selecting marvels among the marvels.</p>

    <p>And then there is not a little paste among the diamonds.</p>

    <p>So, as for me, who have been studying the school of my
    country for twenty years now, I shouldn't even answer if it
    were being discussed, because in general I hear too much talk
    which is beside the point, when the painters of the North are
    under discussion.</p>

    <p>So that my only answer to you is, Bah! look a little closer
    than that; it will truly repay your trouble a thousandfold.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Look here, for instance, if I declare that the Ostade in the
    Louvre representing &ldquo;The Painter's Family&rdquo; (man,
    wife and a dozen children) is a picture infinitely worthy of
    study and reflection, as well as &ldquo;The Peace of
    Munster&rdquo; by Terborch - and then, when those pictures in
    the gallery of the Louvre which I personally prefer and think
    most astonishing are overlooked very often by artists, even by
    those who have come to see the Dutchmen, then I am not very
    surprised, as I know that my choice in that gallery is based on
    a knowledge of this subject which the majority of the French
    could not possibly share.</label></p>

    <p>But if I disagreed with you, for instance, about these
    subjects, I should confidently expect you to grant that I was
    right later on. But what pains me so terribly in the Louvre is
    to see their Rembrandts going to ruin and the idiots of the
    administration letting so many beautiful pictures decay. So the
    annoying yellow tone of certain Rembrandts is the result of
    deterioration from moisture or some other causes; in some cases
    I could point it out to you with a wet finger.</p>

    <p>It is as difficult to say what Rembrandt's colour is as it
    is to give a name to Vel&aacute;squez' grey. For want of a
    better name one might call it &ldquo;Rembrandt gold.&rdquo; And
    this is what they have done, but it is pretty vague.</p>

    <p>Coming to France as a foreigner, I, perhaps better than
    Frenchmen born and bred, have felt Delacroix and Zola, and my
    sincere and wholehearted admiration for them is boundless.</p>

    <p>Since I had a somewhat complete notion of Rembrandt, one,
    Delacroix, got his results by colours, the other, Rembrandt, by
    tonal values, but they are on a par. [In his haste Vincent must
    have left part of this sentence out, but his meaning is clear
    nonetheless.]</p>

    <p>In their quality as painters of a society, of a nature in
    its entirety, Zola and Balzac produce rare artistic emotions in
    those who love them, just because they embrace the whole of the
    epoch they depict.</p>

    <p>When Delacroix paints humanity, life in general, instead of
    an epoch, he belongs no less to the same family of universal
    geniuses.</p>

    <p>I very much like the last words of, I think, Silvestre, who
    ended a masterly article in this way: &ldquo;Thus died - almost
    smiling - Delacroix, a painter of a noble race, who had a sun
    in his head and a thunderstorm in his heart, who turned from
    the warriors to the saints, from the saints to the lovers, from
    the lovers to the tigers, and from the tigers to the
    flowers.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Daumier is also a great genius.</p>

    <p>And then Millet, the painter of a whole race and the
    environment it lives in.</p>

    <p>It is possible that these great geniuses are only madmen,
    and that one must be mad oneself to have boundless faith in
    them and a boundless admiration for them. If this is true, I
    should prefer my insanity to the sanity of the others. Perhaps
    the most direct road is to approach Rembrandt indirectly. Let's
    talk about Frans Hals. He never painted Christs, annunciations
    to the shepherds, angels, crucifixions or resurrections; he
    never painted nude, voluptuous and bestial women.</p>

    <p>He did portraits, and nothing, nothing else.</p>

    <p>Portraits of soldiers, gatherings of officers, portraits of
    magistrates assembled to debate the affairs of the republic,
    portraits of matrons with pink or yellow skins, wearing white
    caps and dressed in wool and black satin, discussing the budget
    of an orphanage or an almshouse. He painted the portraits of
    middle-class men in their homes: the man, the woman, the child.
    He painted the drunken toper, an old fishwife in a mood of
    witch-like hilarity, the pretty gypsy whore, babies in their
    diapers, the dashing, self-indulgent nobleman with his
    mustache, top boots and spurs He painted himself, together with
    his wife, young, deeply in love, on a bench on a lawn, after
    the first wedding night. He painted vagabonds and laughing
    urchins, he painted musicians and he painted a fat cook.</label></p>

    <p>He does not know greater things than that; but it is
    certainly worth as much as Dante's Paradise and the
    Michelangelos and the Raphaels and even the Greeks. It is as
    beautiful as Zola, healthier as well as merrier, but as true to
    life, because his epoch was healthier and less dismal.</p>

    <p>And now what is Rembrandt?</p>

    <p>The same thing absolutely: a painter of portraits.</p>

    <p>One must first of all have a healthy, broad, clear notion of
    these two brilliant Dutchmen, equal in value, before going any
    further into the subject. When we have understood this
    thoroughly - this whole glorious republic, depicted by these
    two prolific portraitists, reconstructed in bold outlines -
    then we still keep a very large margin for landscapes, domestic
    scenes, animals, philosophical subjects.</p>

    <p>But I implore you, follow this straightforward reasoning
    carefully, for I am doing my best to present it to you in a
    very, very simple way.</p>

    <p>Hammer into your head that master Frans Hals, that painter
    of all kinds of portraits, of a whole gallant, live, immortal
    republic. Hammer into your head the no less great and universal
    master painter of portraits of the Dutch republic: Rembrandt
    Harmensz [son of Harmen] van Rijn, that broad-minded
    naturalistic man, as healthy as Hals himself. And then we see
    issuing from this source, Rembrandt, a line of direct and true
    pupils: Vermeer of Delft, Fabritius, Nicholaes Maes, Pieter de
    Hooch, Bol, and those whom he influenced: Potter, Ruysdael,
    Ostade, Terborch. I mention Fabritius here although we know
    only two canvases of his, and I don't mention a lot of good
    painters, and especially not the paste among these diamonds,
    that paste so solidly crammed into the vulgar French
    noodles.</p>

    <p>Am I very incomprehensible, my dear comrade Bernard? I am
    just trying to make you see the great simple thing: the
    painting of humanity, or rather of a whole republic, by the
    simple means of portraiture. This first and foremost. When
    later on - in the case of Rembrandt - we happen to meet with
    mysticism, with Christs, with nude women, then it is very
    interesting but it is not the main thing. Let Baudelaire hold
    his tongue in this domain; his words are sonorous but then
    infinitely shallow.</p>

    <p>Let us take Baudelaire for what he is, a modern poet, just
    as Musset is another, but let him stop being a nuisance when we
    are speaking about painting. <sup>1</sup> I don't like your
    drawing &ldquo;Lechery&rdquo; as much as the others. I like
    &ldquo;The Tree,&rdquo; however; it is very smart.</p>

    <p>A handshake,</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Rembrandt triste h&ocirc;pital tout rempli de murmures</p>
