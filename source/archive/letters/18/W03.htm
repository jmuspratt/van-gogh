    <p>W3</p>

    <p>Arles, 30 March 1888</p>

    <p>Dear Sister,</p>

    <p>In order not to leave your letter unanswered, I will write
    at once after receiving your letter and Mother's, and the good
    wishes of you both.</p>

    <p>I want to tell you that I should be happy to write to you
    more often if it were not that a pretty considerable number of
    things contribute to my not being master of my own time, and
    you should not imagine that I am doing exactly what I like, and
    not doing what I should prefer to leave undone. Work has got me
    in its grip now, and I think forever, and though this is not
    something to be unhappy about, yet the mental picture I have of
    happiness is different.</p>

    <p>In the first place, it pleased me enormously that Theo and
    Mr. Tersteeg have entered into business relations in order to
    make the work of the painters here who are called
    impressionists known in Holland too.</p>

    <p>Further, I don't regret coming here, for I think the scenery
    here extremely beautiful.</p>

    <p>I shall have to produce an enormous number of things against
    next year - when the World's Fair will be held - seeing that my
    friends will not fail to have many interesting things on hand
    by then. Not that I myself or any of the painters I hold
    regular or special intercourse with are going to exhibit along
    with the others, but it is to be expected that there will be a
    free exhibition besides the official one. Now, for instance, I
    am working on six pictures of fruit trees in bloom. And what I
    brought home today would probably please you - <art id=0394>it is a dug-up
    square of earth in an orchard with a fence of rushes and two
    peach trees in full bloom. Pink against a scintillating blue
    sky with white clouds, and in the sunshine.(+)</p>

    <p>[Added as a footnote](+)It is possible you
    will see it, for I have finally decided to set it aside for Jet
    Mauve. I have written on it &ldquo;Souvenir de Mauve, Vincent
    and Theo.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>Of course I know very well that I could have found a similar
    subject elsewhere, but if I take into consideration that many
    painters will paint the same thing, I do not think it a matter
    of indifference to work in the midst of a scenery which,
    although in general similar to ours, is undoubtedly richer and
    more colourful as subject matter and motif.</p>

    <p>And then people here are picturesque too, and whereas in our
    country a beggar looks more like a spectre, he becomes
    a caricature here. Because - as you will observe when you read
    Zola and Guy de Maupassant - what they absolutely insist on is
    a great richness and a great gaiety in art - even though this
    same Zola and Guy de Maupassant have said perhaps the most
    poignantly tragic things that have ever been said - this same
    tendency is beginning to be the rule in the art of painting
    too.</p>

    <p>So I can imagine, for instance, that a present-day painter
    should do something like what one finds described in Pierre
    Loti's book Le mariage de Loti, in which a picture of nature in
    Otaheite is drawn. A book which I warmly recommend to you to
    read.</p>

    <p>You will understand that nature in the South cannot be
    painted with the palette of Mauve, for instance, who belongs to
    the North, and who is, and will remain, a master of the grey.
    But at present the palette is distinctly colourful, sky blue,
    orange, pink, vermilion, bright yellow, bright green, bright
    wine-red, violet.</p>

    <p>But by intensifying <i>all</i> the colours one arrives once
    again at quietude and harmony. There occurs in nature something
    similar in what happens in Wagner's music, which, though played
    by a big orchestra, is nonetheless intimate. Only when making a
    choice one prefers sunny and colourful effects, and there is
    nothing that prevents me from thinking that in the future many
    painters will go and work in tropical countries.<label content="art.influences"> You will be
    able to get an idea of the revolution of painting when you
    think, for instance, of the brightly coloured Japanese pictures
    that one sees everywhere, landscapes and figures. Theo and I
    have hundreds of Japanese pictures in our own possession.</label> You
    see I wrote only about my work, and I have to stop now, and I
    don't know if I shall be able to write anything more.</p>

    <p>Best wishes to you and Mother, and thanks for your
    letters.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>It is my own duty to congratulate you on your birthday; as I
    should very much like to give you something of my work that
    will please you, I have set aside <art id=0393>a little study of a book for
    you</art>, and also, on a somewhat larger scale,<art id=0359> a
    flower, with a lot of books with pink, green and bright red
    bindings - they were my set of seven Parisian novels</art>, the same subject - Theo will
    take them along for you - I have a study for Jet Mauve too.</p>
