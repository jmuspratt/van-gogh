  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am dropping you another line as your letter hasn't come
    yet. But I suppose you thought I would probably be in
    S<sup>tes</sup>-Maries.</p>

    <p>Since the rent of the house and the painting of the doors
    and windows and the purchases of canvases all came at the same
    time, I've run out, and you would be doing me a very great
    kindness if you could send me the money a few days earlier.</p>

    <p>I am working on <art id=0412>a landscape with wheat fields</art> which, I
    think, is as good as, say,<art id=0403> the white orchard</art>. It is in the same
    style as the <art id=0350>two landscapes</art> of<art id=0316> the Butte Montmartre</art> which were
    at the Ind&eacute;pendants, but I think it is more robust and
    rather more stylish.</p>

    <p>And I have another subject, <art id=0425>a farm and some haystacks</art>, which
    will probably be the pendant.</p>

    <p>I am very curious to know what Gauguin plans to do. I hope
    he'll be able to come. You will tell me that it's pointless to
    think about the future, but the painting is progressing slowly
    and where that's concerned you do have to plan ahead. If I sold
    no more than a few canvases, that would be neither Gauguin's
    salvation nor mine. To be able to work one has to order one's
    life as best one can, and to secure one's existence one needs a
    fairly solid basis. If he and I stay here for a <i>long</i>
    time, our pictures will become more and more individual,
    precisely because we shall have made a more thorough study of
    subjects in this region.</p>

    <p>Now that I have made a start in the South, I can hardly
    conceive of going anywhere else. Better not to do any more
    moving - just to keep going out into the countryside.</p>

    <p>I'm sure I should have a greater chance of success if I
    tackled subjects - and even business matters - on a somewhat
    bigger scale, instead of confining myself to one that is too
    small.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">And for that very reason I'm thinking of working on larger
    canvases and launching out boldly to the 30 square. These cost
    me 4 francs apiece here, and taking carriage into account that
    isn't expensive.</label></p>

    <p>The latest canvas absolutely kills all the others; it is
    only the <art id=0410>still life with the coffeepots and cups and plates in
    blue and yellow </art>that could stand the comparison with it. It
    must be because of the drawing.</p>

    <p>I can't help recalling what I've seen of C&eacute;zanne's
    work, because - as in the harvest which we saw at Portier's -
    he has bought out the harsh side of Provence so much.</p>

    <p>It has become very different from what it was in spring, and
    yet I certainly have no less love for this countryside, which
    is already beginning to look scorched. One might say that
    everything has old gold, bronze and copper in it, and this,
    together with the green azure of the white-hot sky, imparts a
    delicious, exceptionally harmonious colour, with broken tones
    &agrave; la Delacroix.</p>

    <p>If Gauguin were willing to join us it would be, I think, a
    step forward for us. It would establish us squarely as the
    openers-up of the South, and nobody could argue with that.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">I must try to achieve the solidity of colour that I got in
    that picture that kills the rest. I remember what Portier used
    to say, that his C&eacute;zannes, seen by themselves, looked
    like nothing on earth, but that when placed next to other
    canvases they wiped the colour out of all the rest. And also
    that the C&eacute;zannes looked good in gold, which implies a
    brilliant palette.</p>

    <p>Perhaps, perhaps, I am therefore on the right track and I am
    getting an eye for the countryside here.</label></p>

    <p>We'll have to wait and see.</p>

    <p>This latest picture stands up well to the red surroundings
    of the bricks with which my studio is paved. When I put it on
    the floor, on this brick-red, <i>deep red</i>, ground, the
    colour of the picture does not look washed-out or blanched.</p>

    <p>The countryside near Aix - where C&eacute;zanne works - is
    just the same as here, it is still the Crau. When I get back
    home with my canvas and I say to myself, Hullo, I've got old
    C&eacute;zanne's very tones, all I mean is that since
    C&eacute;zanne, just like Zola, is <i>so at home in these
    parts</i> and hence knows them so intimately, one must be
    making the same mental calculation to arrive at the same tones.
    It goes without saying that seen side by side they would go
    together, but not look alike. With a handshake, I hope that you
    will be able to write one of these days.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
