  <body>
    <p>My dear comrade Bernard,</p>

    <p>Just a word to thank you for your drawings; I think they
    were done a little too hastily, and I like the drawings of the
    whores better; but for the rest there is an idea in all of
    them. I have been overwhelmed with work lately, for the weather
    is glorious, and I must make the most of the fine days, which
    are short.</p>

    <p>I cannot withdraw what I said about the price: three francs,
    just for food, and then the extras! But I have no doubt that
    all that Gauguin told you about the prices here is correct. But
    all that I can see is that the moment of your departure to do
    your military service is drawing near, and I very much wish to
    induce your father to provide you with what's necessary to
    fortify yourself with good food, without your work suffering
    under it. Let him do the handsome thing and give you all that
    is reasonable in the interval between now and the time of your
    service.</p>

    <p>I have written you insistently and repeatedly that, if you
    go to Africa, you will work there, and you will see the very
    scenery which you ought to see to develop your talent as a
    painter and a colourist to its full extent. But this can only
    be done at the expense of your poor carcass, unless before your
    African hardships your father enables you to avoid getting
    anemic or catching a debilitating dysentery as a result of a
    lack of strengthening food.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.diet">It is hardly possible to fortify one's body over there; far
    be it from me to say that when one is going into a hot climate
    one ought to fatten oneself up first, but what I do say is that
    one should attend to one's nourishment some time in advance;
    and I abide by this through thick and thin, as this regimen
    agrees with me so well here, because there is some difference
    between the heat of Africa and the heat of Arles.</label></p>

    <p>You will either come out of this trial of your service much
    stronger, strong enough for a whole artistic career - or a
    broken man.</p>

    <p>However that may be, I should be enormously delighted if you
    came here, and if Gauguin came too; and then the only thing to
    be regretted will be that it is winter and not the season of
    fine weather. <label content="health.gastrointestinal">I am coming to believe more and more
    that the cuisine has something to do with our ability to think and to
    make pictures; as for me, when my stomach bothers me it is not
    conducive to the success of my work.</label></p>

    <p>In short, I think that, if your father made up his mind
    quietly to preserve your pictures and grant you a somewhat
    generous credit, he would lose less in the end than if he acted
    differently. In the South one's senses get keener, one's hand
    becomes more agile, one's eye more alert, one's brain clearer,
    however on condition: that all this is not spoiled by dysentery
    or something else of a debilitating nature. But apart from that
    I venture to believe most firmly that anyone who loves artistic
    work will find his productive faculties develop in the South;
    but take care of your blood and take care of everything
    else.</p>

    <p>And now you will tell me perhaps that I am boring you with
    all this - that you want to go to the brothel without giving a
    damn about all the rest. Good heavens, it all depends, but I
    cannot speak differently than I do. Art is long and life is
    short, and we must be patient, while trying to sell our lives
    dearly. How I wish I were your age, and could go off, knowing
    what I know, to do my military service in Africa; but then I
    should get myself a better body than I have now, and no
    mistake!</p>

    <p>If Gauguin and I are here together, which will probably
    happen, then we shall certainly do our utmost to save you
    expense; but then your father, on his part, ought to do his
    utmost too, and have confidence in us, and realize that we are
    not trying to do him out of more money than necessary. To do
    good work one must eat well, be well housed, have one's fling
    from time to time, smoke one's pipe and drink one's coffee in
    peace.</p>

    <p>I do not say that all the other things are without value, I
    want to leave everybody free to do what he likes; but what I do
    say is that this system seems preferable to me to a good many
    others.</p>

    <p>A hearty handshake,</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Vincent</p>
