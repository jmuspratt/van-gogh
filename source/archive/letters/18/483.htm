  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just received your letter enclosing 100 Frs. Thank
    you very much, also for the earlier one (likewise dated from
    Brussels) enclosing 50 Frs. This is to tell you that I got them
    all right. Only there must be at least two letters that I sent
    to Paris, and a roll of drawings which, just as you thought,
    Koning cannot have sent on to you. Koning has sent me a
    postcard saying that he had had a note from the Independents
    that if the pictures were not taken away between <i>April</i> 5
    and 6, they would be deposited elsewhere in a furniture store.
    All he had to do was to get them, if he meant between May 5 and
    6. It's likely that the good boy has rather lost his head,
    because of your being away.</p>

    <p>I am glad that you have sold a Degas, and to hear what you
    say of this buyer Meunier. I have seen very fine things by him
    myself and of course by Henri de Braekeleer too.</p>

    <p>That fellow who came to Paris from the Vingtistes, you
    remember, Los Rios de Guadalquivir [R. de los Rios], or
    something even more sonorous, declared that De Braekeleer had
    been reduced to utter helplessness by a disease of the brain
    that had left him a hopeless wreck. I should like to think it
    isn't true. Have you heard of it?</p>

    <p>You will see by the letters in question that I have taken a
    studio, an entire 4-room house at 180 francs a year. Now the
    thing is to go and sleep there. I am going to buy a mat and a
    mattress and blanket today.</p>

    <p>I also have to pay the hotel 40 francs, so I shan't have
    much left. But from now on I shall be free of that inn where
    one paid far too much and wasn't comfortable at that. And I
    shall begin to have a home of my own.</p>

    <p>You will find details in the letters I have already written.
    There has been a good deal of mistral here, so I did the dozen
    little drawings which I have sent you.</p>

    <p>Now the weather is splendid, I have done another two big
    drawings and five small ones.</p>

    <p>I have found a case to send my things in, and I hope they'll
    leave tomorrow. I am sending the five small drawings to you in
    Brussels today.</p>

    <p>You will see some lovely things at Claude Monet's. And you
    will think what I send very poor stuff in comparison. Just now
    I am dissatisfied with myself and dissatisfied with what I do,
    but I have just a glimmer of hope that I'm going to do better
    in the end.</p>

    <p>And then I hope that later on other artists will rise up in
    this lovely country and do for it what the Japanese have done
    for theirs. And it's not so bad to work towards that end.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">I often used to go for walks with Rappard where you said. Is
    the suburb and the country beyond the Congress Column called
    Schaerbeek? I remember a place called, I think, the valley of
    Jehosaphat, where there were some poplars, and where Hypolyte
    Boulanger the landscapist did some lovely things.</p>

    <p>I remember sunsets in the Jardin des Plantes seen from the
    boulevard which runs alongside.</label></p>

    <p>You will find some reeds for Koning in the case I'm sending.
    The address from now on will be:</p>

    <p>2 Place Lamartine.</p>

    <p>I hope - indeed I'm sure - that when you return to Paris it
    will be spring at last, and my word, none too soon.</p>

    <p>You get nowhere if you live at a hotel, but now after a year
    I shall have some furniture, etc., which will be my own; and
    though this would not matter if I were only in the South for a
    few months, it is very different when it's a question of a long
    stay. And I have no fear but that I shall always love this
    country. It is rather like Japanese art, once you love it, you
    never go back on it.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
