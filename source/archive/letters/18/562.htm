  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for the 100 francs you sent and for your letter.
    I know you will be pleased to hear that I have had a letter
    from Jet Mauve, thanking us for <art id=0394>the picture</art>. A very nice
    letter, in which she speaks of old times. I am going to answer
    it and I shall send some sketches in the letter besides.</p>

    <p>You will also be pleased to hear that we have an addition to
    the collection of portraits of artists. The <art id=avalsp>self- portrait by
    Laval,</art> extremely good.</p>

    <p>[Here was drawn <art id=698_V-T_5620>a copy of the Laval self-portrait.</art>]</p>

    <p>Also a marine by Bernard in exchange for canvases of mine.</p>

    <p>The portrait of Laval is very bold, very distinguished, and
    will be just one of the pictures you speak of, those one gets
    hold of before other people have recognized the talents.</p>

    <p>I think it excellent that you are taking a Luce. Has he a
    self- portrait by any chance? Just in case there should be
    nothing extraordinarily interesting, portraits are always
    good.</p>

    <p>Gauguin is working on a very original nude woman in the hay
    with some pigs. It promises to be very fine, and of great
    distinction. He has sent to Paris for the return of a
    magnificent jar with 2 rats' heads.</p>

    <p>He is a very great artist and a very excellent friend.</p>

    <p>If ever you could get a good Bernard, I very strongly advise
    you to. Gauguin has a superb one.</p>

    <p>I have been working on two canvases.</p>

    <p>A <art id=0496>memory of our garden at Etten</art>, with
    cabbages, cypresses, dahlias, and figures, then <art id=0497>a Woman reading
    a novel in a library like the Lecture Fran&ccedil;aise, a woman
    all in green</art>. Gauguin gives me the courage to
    work from my imagination, and certainly things from the
    imagination take on a more mysterious character.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">Tasset's package arrived the day before yesterday, and we
    were very pleased with it. Could Tasset send besides - but it
    is urgent - one very big tube of vermilion (same size as the
    big flake white) and 3 tubes of Prussian blue of the same size?
    We should be tremendously obliged.</label></p>

    <p>I am glad Jet Mauve has written, and I venture to think that
    little by little they will come round to the impressionists
    after all. A handshake in thought for you, and my compliments
    to Haan and Isa&auml;cson.</p>

    <p>Ever Yours, Vincent</p>
