  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter and the 50-franc note which it
    contained.</p>

    <p>I also received Maurin's drawing, which is magnificent. That
    man is a great artist. Last night I slept in the house, and
    though there are some things still to be done, I feel very
    happy in it. Besides, I feel that I can make something lasting
    out of it, from which others can profit as well. Now money
    spent will not be money lost, and I think that you will soon
    see the difference. At present it reminds me of Bosboom's
    interiors, with the red tiles, the white walls, the furniture
    of white deal and walnut and the glimpses of an intense blue
    sky and greenery through the windows. Its surroundings, the
    public garden, the night caf&eacute;s and the grocer's, are not
    Millet, but instead they are Daumier, absolute Zola.</p>

    <p>And that is quite enough to supply one with ideas, isn't
    it?</p>

    <p>Yesterday I had already written to you, saying that if I
    figure the two beds at 300 francs, the price will not allow of
    any further reduction. If I have already bought more than that
    anyway, it is because I put half of last week's money into it.
    Yesterday again I had to pay 10 francs to the innkeeper and 30
    francs for a mattress.</p>

    <p>At the moment I have 5 francs left, so I must beg you to
    send me what you can, or else - but do let it be by return mail
    - a louis to last me the week, or indeed 50 francs if it's
    possible.</p>

    <p>In one way or another I'd like to be able to count on
    getting this month, meaning the whole month, another 100
    instead of the 50, as I asked you in yesterday's letter.</p>

    <p>If I myself save 50 francs during the month, and add the
    other 50 to that, I should have spent altogether 400 francs on
    furniture. My dear Theo, here we are on the right road at last.
    Certainly it does not matter being without hearth or home and
    living in caf&eacute;s like a traveler so long as one is young,
    but it was becoming unbearable to me, and more than that, it
    did not fit in with thoughtful work. So my plan is all
    complete, I will try to paint up to the value of what you send
    me every month, and after that I want to paint to pay for the
    house. What I paint for the house will be to repay you for
    previous expenditure.</p>

    <p>I am still a bit commercial, in the sense that I long to
    prove that I pay my debts, and that I know how much I want for
    the goods which this blasted poor painter's profession keeps me
    working at.</p>

    <p>Altogether I think I can be almost sure of bringing off a
    set of decorations which will be worth 10.000 francs in
    time.</p>

    <p>Listen to me. If we set up a studio and refuge here for some
    comrade who is hard up, no one will ever be able to reproach
    either you or me with living and spending for ourselves alone.
    Now to establish such a studio requires a floating capital, and
    I have eaten that up during my unproductive years, but now that
    I am beginning to produce something, I shall pay it back.</p>

    <p>I assure you that I think it is essential for you as well as
    me, and no more than our right, too, to always have a louis or
    two in our pockets, and some stock of goods to do business
    with. But my idea is that in the end we shall have founded and
    left to posterity a studio where one's successor could live. I
    do not know if I explain myself clearly enough, but in other
    words we are working for an art and for a business method that
    will not only last our lifetime, but can still be carried on by
    others after us.</p>

    <p>For your part you do this in your business, and it is
    certain that you will make good in the end, even though you
    have plenty to harry you at the moment. But for my part I
    foresee that other artists will want to see colour under a
    stronger sun, and in a more Japanese clarity of light.</p>

    <p>Now if I set up a studio and refuge right at the gates of
    the South, it's not such a crazy scheme. And it means that we
    can work on serenely. And if other people say that it is too
    far from Paris, etc., let them, so much the worse for them. Why
    did the greatest colourist of all, Eugene Delacroix, think it
    essential to go south and right to Africa? Obviously, because
    not only in Africa but from Arles onward you are bound to find
    beautiful contrasts of red and green, of blue and orange, of
    sulphur and lilac.</p>

    <p>And all true colourists must come to this, must admit that
    there is another kind of colour than that of the North. I am
    sure if Gauguin came, he would love this country; if he doesn't
    it's because he has already experienced more brightly coloured
    countries and he will always be a friend, and one with us in
    principle.</p>

    <p>And someone else will come in his place.</p>

    <p>If what one is doing looks out upon the infinite, and if one
    sees that one's work has its raison d'&ecirc;tre and
    continuance in the future, then one works with more
    serenity.</p>

    <p>Now you have a double right to that.</p>

    <p>You are kind to painters, and I tell you, the more I think
    it over, the more I feel that there is nothing more truly
    artistic than to love people. You will say that then it would
    be a good thing to do without art and artists. That is true in
    the first instance, but then the Greeks and the French and the
    old Dutchmen accepted art, and we see how art always comes to
    life again after inevitable periods of decadence, and I do not
    think that anyone is the better for abhorring artists and their
    art. At present I do not think my pictures worthy of the
    advantages I have received from you. But once they are worthy,
    I swear that you will have created them as much as I, and that
    we are making them together.</p>

    <p>But I will not say more about that, because it will be as
    clear as daylight to you when I begin to do things more
    seriously. At the moment I am working on another square size 30
    canvas, <art id=0470>another garden or rather a walk under plane trees, with
    the green turf, and black clumps of pines</art>.</p>

    <p>You did well to order the paints and the canvas, because the
    weather is magnificent. We still have the mistral, but there
    are calm intervals and then it is wonderful.</p>

    <p>If there were less mistral, this place would really be as
    lovely as Japan, and would lend itself as well to art.</p>

    <p>As I was writing, a very kind letter arrived from Bernard;
    he is thinking of coming to Arles this winter, just a whim, but
    it is possible that Gauguin is sending him as a substitute, and
    would rather stay in the North himself. We shall soon know,
    because I am convinced that he will write you one way or the
    other.</p>

    <p>In his letter Bernard speaks of Gauguin with great respect
    and sympathy, and I am sure that they understand one
    another.</p>

    <p>And I really think that Gauguin has done Bernard good.</p>

    <p>Whether Gauguin comes or not, he will remain friends with
    us, and if he does not come now, he will come another time.</p>

    <p>I feel instinctively that Gauguin is a schemer who, seeing
    himself at the bottom of the social ladder, wants to regain a
    position by means which will certainly be honest, but at the
    same time, very politic.</p>

    <p>Gauguin little knows that I am able to take all this into
    account. And perhaps he does not know that it is absolutely
    necessary for him to gain time, and that with us he will gain
    that, if he gains nothing else.</p>

    <p>If someday he decamps from Pont-Aven with Laval or Maurin
    without paying his debts, I think in his case he would still be
    justified, exactly like any other creature at bay. I do not
    think it would be wise to offer Bernard straight off 150 francs
    for a picture every month, as you did Gauguin. And Bernard, who
    has evidently been over and over the whole business with
    Gauguin - isn't he rather counting on taking Gauguin's
    place?</p>

    <p>I think it will be necessary to be very firm and very
    explicit about the whole thing.</p>

    <p>And without giving any reasons, to speak very plainly.</p>

    <p>I cannot blame Gauguin - speculator though he may be as soon
    as he wants to risk something in business, only I will have
    nothing to do with it. I would a thousand times rather go on
    with you, whether you are with the Goupils or not.</p>

    <p>And in my opinion, you know, the new dealers are exactly and
    in every way the same as the old.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">In principle, and in theory, I am for an association of
    artists who guarantee each other's work and living, but in
    principle and in theory I am equally against attempts to
    destroy old, established businesses. Let them rot in peace, and
    die a natural death. It is pure presumption to hope to
    regenerate trade. Have nothing to do with it; let's guarantee a
    living among ourselves, live like a family, like brothers and
    friends, and this even if it should not succeed - I would like
    to be in this, but I will never have anything to do with an
    attack on other dealers.</label></p>

    <p>With a handshake, and I hope that what I have been obliged
    to ask you will not be too terribly inconvenient. But I did not
    want to postpone sleeping at home. And in case you are short
    yourself, 20 francs more will get me through the week, but it
    is urgent.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I am keeping all Bernard's letters, they are sometimes
    really interesting. You shall read them someday, there is quite
    a bundle already.</p>

    <p>When I said that we must be firm with Gauguin, it is only
    because you had already given your opinion when he told you his
    plan of action in Paris. You made him a good answer then
    without committing yourself, but also without wounding his
    self-respect.</p>

    <p>And the same thing may become necessary again.</p>

    <p>I think I shall see Milliet today. Thank you in advance for
    the Japanese things.</p>
