  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I thank you very much for your letter, which I had not dared
    to expect so soon, as far as the 50-fr. note which you added
    was concerned.</p>

    <p>I see that you have not yet had an answer from Tersteeg. I
    don't think that we need press him with a new letter. However,
    if you have any official business to transact with B. V. &amp;
    Co. in The Hague, you might mention in a P. S. that you are
    rather surprised that he has in no way acknowledged the receipt
    of the letter in question.</p>

    <p>As for my work, I brought back a size 15 canvas today.<art id=0397> It is
    a drawbridge over which passes a little cart, standing out against
    a blue sky - the river blue as well, the banks orange coloured
    with grass and a group of women washing linen in smocks
    and multicoloured caps</art>. And another landscape
    with <art id=0396>a little rustic bridge and washerwomen also</art>.</p>

    <p>Finally <art id=0398>an avenue of plane trees close to the station</art>.
    Altogether 12 studies since I've been here.</p>

    <p>The weather here is changeable, often windy with turbulent
    skies, but the almond trees are beginning to flower everywhere.
    I am very happy that the paintings are going to the Independents.
    You are right to go to see Signac at his house. I was very glad
    to read in today's letter that he made a more favourable
    impression on you than the first time. In any case I am
    glad to know that after today you will not be alone in the
    apartment.</p>

    <p>Remember me kindly to Koning. Are you well? <label content="health.gastrointestinal">I am better
    myself, except that eating is a real ordeal, since I have a touch
    of fever and no appetite, but it's only a question of time and
    patience.</label></p>

    <p>I have company in the evening, for the young Danish painter
    who is here is a decent soul: his work is dry, correct and
    timid, but I do not object to that when the painter is young
    and intelligent. He originally began studying medicine: he knows
    Zola, de Goncourt, Guy de Maupassant, and he has
    enough money to do himself well. And with all this, a very
    genuine desire to do very different work than what he is
    producing now.</p>

    <p>I think he would be wise to delay his return home for a
    year, or to come back here after a short visit to his
    friends.</p>

    <p>But, my dear brother, you know that I feel as though I am in Japan - I
    say no more than that, and I still haven't seen anything in its
    usual splendour yet.</p>

    <p>That's why (even though I'm vexed that just now expenses
    are heavy and the paintings worthless), that's why I don't
    despair of the future success of this idea of a long sojourn in
    the Midi.</p>

    <p>Here I am seeing new things, I am learning, and if I take it
    easy, my body doesn't refuse to function.</p>

    <p>For many reasons I should like to establish some sort of little
    retreat, where the poor cab horses of Paris - that is yourself and
    several of our friends, the poor impressionists - could go out
    to pasture when they get too exhausted.</p>

    <p>I was present at the Inquiry into a crime committed at the
    door of a brothel here; two Italians killed two Zouaves. I
    took advantage of the opportunity to go into one of the brothels in a
    little street called &ldquo;des ricolettes.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>That is the extent of my amorous adventures among the
    Arl&eacute;siennes. The mob all but (the Southerner, like
    Tartarin, being more energetic in good intentions than in
    action) - the mob, I repeat, all but lynched the murderers
    locked up in the town hall, but in retaliation all the Italians
    - men and women, the Savoyard monkeys included - have been
    forced to leave town.</p>

    <p>I should not have told you about this, except that it means
    I've seen the streets of this town full of excited crowds. And
    it was indeed a fine sight.</p>

    <p><label content="art.equipment">I made my last three studies with the perspective frame
    which you know I use. I attach some importance to the use of
    the frame because it seems not unlikely to me that in the near
    future many artists will make use of it, just as the old German
    and Italian painters certainly did, and, as I am inclined to
    think, the Flemish too. The modern use of it may differ from
    the ancient practice, but in the same way isn't it true that in
    the process of painting in oils one gets very different effects
    today from those of the men who invented the process, Jan and
    Hubert van Eyck? </label>And the moral of this is that it's my constant
    hope that I am not working for myself alone. I believe in the
    absolute necessity of a new art of colour, of design, and - of
    the artistic life. And if we work in that faith, it seems to me
    that there is a chance that we do not hope in vain.</p>

    <p>You must know that I am actually ready to send some studies
    off to you, only it is impossible to roll them up yet. A hearty handshake. On
    Sunday I shall write to Bernard and de Lautrec, because I
    solemnly promised to, and shall send you those letters as well.
    I am deeply sorry for Gauguin's plight, especially because
    his health is shaken: he no longer has the kind of temperament that
    profits from hardships - on the contrary, this will only
    exhaust him from here on, and that will spoil him for his work.
    Goodbye for the present.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
