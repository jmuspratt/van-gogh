    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">I see that I did not put in the sample of the canvas in the
    list for Tasset. So I am sending it with this letter.</label></p>

    <p>I had hoped to hear from you today, thinking that you surely
    would have received the case.</p>

    <p>I remember having <i>written</i> on the dispatch form that
    the case was to be delivered at the <i>house</i>.</p>

    <p>But as stuff sent by goods train often remains standing
    <i>in the station</i>, if you have not already received the
    case, you had better call and see.</p>

    <p>I have got them to repaint the house, the front, the doors,
    and the windows both inside and out. Only I must pay 10 francs
    as my share. But I think that it will be very well worth
    it.</p>

    <p>I am working with pleasure.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I have asked for some watercolours because I would like to
    make some open drawings, to be washed afterward in flat tints
    like the Japanese prints.</label></p>

    <p>I hope you will have as fine a Sunday in Paris as we are
    having here; there is a glorious sun, and no wind.</p>

    <p>Write me at once, I have no money at all.</p>

    <p>With a handshake for you and Koning.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>What exactly is the exchange that Koning is to make with me?
    He asked me for two drawings for one study of his. I accepted,
    telling him to give you the study, but I have had no reply to
    that. If it means that friend Koning has changed his mind and
    would prefer not to exchange anything, of course I shall not
    insist at all.</p>
