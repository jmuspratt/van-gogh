  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>In case of doubt it is better to do nothing, I think that is
    what I said in the letter to Gauguin, and that is what I think
    now, having read his answer. If he on his part returns to the
    idea, he is very welcome, but we should look too - I don't know
    just what - if at the moment we pressed him to say Yes. You see
    that I have had your letter, thank you very much for it, there
    was a lot in it; thank you very much for the 100-franc note
    too. As for the delay of the wire, it was dated Sunday, so it
    is the postman's fault, but it did not matter, because the
    coach for Stes-Maries runs every day. Only what kept me back
    was the necessity of buying canvases and paying the rent.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">I have already hinted that I don't greatly care for Tasset's
    canvas for work in the open air. In the future I think we will
    have the ordinary canvas. I have bought 50 francs' worth of
    canvas with stretchers as well, as I need stretchers of
    different sizes to stretch the canvas on, although I send them
    to you rolled up. They are the rather large sizes, 30, 25, 20,
    and 15 - all of them square. I think that the large sizes
    (after all they aren't very big) suit me better.</label></p>

    <p>But I must talk about what you wrote in your letter. I
    congratulate you on having the Monet exhibition at your place,
    and I am very sorry I can't see it. It will certainly not do
    Tersteeg any harm to see this exhibition; he will come round to
    it yet, but, as you thought too, it will be late. It is
    certainly odd that he has changed his mind about Zola. I know
    from experience that once he couldn't bear to hear a word about
    him. What a queer character Tersteeg is; he has the excellent
    quality that, however hard and fixed his opinions may be, once
    he has realized that a thing is actually different from what he
    thought, as with Zola for instance, he turns around and becomes
    enthusiastic for it. Lord, what a pity that you and he don't
    see eye to eye in business now. But that's that; it's what I
    think is called fatality.</p>

    <p>You have been lucky to meet Guy de Maupassant. I have just
    read his first book, Des Vers, poems dedicated to his master
    Flaubert; there is one, &ldquo;Au bord de l'eau,&rdquo; which
    is already <i>himself</i>. What Van der Meer of Delft is to
    Rembrandt among the painters, he is to Zola among the French
    novelists.</p>

    <p>Altogether Tersteeg's visit was not all that I had dared to
    hope, and I do not disguise from myself that I made a false
    calculation based on the likelihood of his co-operation.</p>

    <p>And in the business with Gauguin too, perhaps. Let's wait
    and see. I thought that he was on the rocks, and there I was
    with money, and this boy who does better work than I do with
    none; so I said, He ought to have half of mine, and let him, if
    he likes.</p>

    <p>But if Gauguin isn't on the rocks, then I am in no great
    hurry. And I withdraw my proposal categorically, and the only
    question left for me is simply this: if I looked for a comrade
    to work with, would it be a good thing, would it be to my
    brother's advantage and mine, and would the other fellow lose
    by it, or would he gain? These are the questions that my mind
    is running on, but they'd have to come up against reality to
    become facts.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">I do not want to discuss Gauguin's project, having once
    thought the situation over this winter - you know the result.
    You know that I think a Society of Impressionists would be
    something of the same nature as the Society of the Twelve
    English Pre-Raphaelites, and I think that the artists would
    guarantee each other a livelihood, each consenting to give a
    considerable number of pictures to the society, and that the
    profits as well as the losses should be had in common.</label></p>

    <p>I do not think that this society would last indefinitely,
    but I think that while it lasted we should live courageously,
    and produce.</p>

    <p>But if Gauguin and his Jewish bankers came tomorrow and
    asked me for no more than 10 pictures for a society of dealers,
    and not a society of artists, on my word I do not know if I'd
    have confidence in it, though I would willingly give 50 to a
    society of artists.</p>

    <p>Isn't it a bit like Reid - why say that Gabriel de la
    Roquette is a queer fellow if you do the same yourself? There,
    there, let the boy do as his heart inclines, but his plan is
    far from making me enthusiastic. I'd rather have things as they
    are, taking them for what they're worth without altering them,
    than have them only half reformed.</p>

    <p>The great revolution - art for the artists - Lord, Lord,
    perhaps it is Utopia: well then, so much the worse for us.</p>

    <p>I feel that life is so short and goes so fast; well, being a
    painter, one must paint after all.</p>

    <p>You also know that since then, that winter, it has been
    casually discussed a good deal with Pissarro and the rest, and
    at present I will not try to say any more than this, that
    personally before next year I mean to do my share of 50
    pictures; if I manage to do that, then I stick to my
    opinion.</p>

    <p>Today I sent you 3 drawings by post.</p>

    <p>You will think the one with <art id=1425>the ricks in a farmyard</art> too
    bizarre, but it was done in a great hurry as a cartoon for<art id=0425> a
    picture </art>and it is to show you the idea.</p>

    <p>The<art id=1484> &ldquo;Harvest&rdquo;</art> is rather more serious.</p>

    <p>That is <art id=0412>the subject I have worked on this week on a size 30
    canvas</art>; it isn't at all finished, but it kills everything else
    I have, except <art id=0410>a still life which I patiently worked out</art>.
    McKnight and one of his friends who has also been in Africa saw
    it today, this study, and said it was the best I had done. Like
    Anquetin and friend Thomas - you can't help thinking something
    of yourself when you hear that said, but then I say, &ldquo;The
    rest certainly must seem damn bad.&rdquo; And the days when I
    bring home a study I say to myself - If it was like this every
    day, we might be able to get on; but the days when you come
    back empty-handed, and eat and sleep and spend money all the
    same, you don't think much of yourself, and you feel like a
    fool and a shirker and a good-for-nothing.</p>

    <p>And dear Doctor Ox, I mean our Swede Mourier, I am rather
    fond of him, because he goes ingenuously and benignly around
    this wretched world with his spectacles, and because I credit
    him with a more virgin heart than most, and with even more
    inclination to honesty than many a scoundrel has. And knowing
    that he has not been painting long, I do not care a bit that
    his work is the acme of fatuousness. And I saw him every day
    for several months.</p>

    <p>Well, what can be the reason for his losing those qualities?
    This is what I think. He came to the South to recover from a
    nervous illness, caused by a lot of worry he has had, on
    account of which he changed his career. He was <i>perfectly
    well</i> here, he was very even tempered. But the shock of
    Paris has been too much, the change too sudden, he has not
    found the Paris of his dreams, and so he is restless and
    perhaps disagreeable, and anyway making an ass of himself.</p>

    <p>He will soon get over his mental measles, I hope. Meanwhile
    let him do what he likes, without feeling that it matters. He
    counts a lot on Russell (<i>I think</i>), he wants an adviser
    and a master, and it's no good telling him that Russell may not
    be <i>everything</i> that he needs.</p>

    <p>But I think that Russell will see that here's somebody who
    does not know the surroundings he has to deal with, and I think
    that Russell will take him seriously and will try to be good to
    him. I think Russell is getting a reputation among those who
    are instinctively afraid of Paris.</p>

    <p>It is difficult to explain what I mean by that. Russell is
    such a good fellow, but you know that one can't order or force
    people to like Paris, any more than one can recommend that they
    take a pipe or black coffee with their brandy. Then Russell is
    rich, and has lost money in Paris, so he can and does say to
    people, &ldquo;That's what I've been up against.&rdquo; But
    anyway, I'm going to write a short note to Russell.</p>

    <p>It appears that McKnight was not very pleased with me, but
    that Russell told him in reply that he should hold his
    tongue.</p>

    <p>All this is to tell you that I understand, thoroughly
    understand, since he has turned out like this, why you are not
    getting along with the Swede, who probably, judging by what you
    write, is again suffering from his nervous disorders and is set
    on edge by Paris. If he had money to waste by taking a studio
    &agrave; la G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, it would be serious; seeing
    that I rather imagine he hasn't a great deal to waste, he will
    be in for some censure, and my word, he rather deserves it.
    Nothing can be done if he won't listen, but he must not stay
    on.</p>

    <p>I am not writing to Gauguin direct, but will send the letter
    to you, because in any case we had better sit tight. <i>If we
    say nothing more</i>, if the reply shows that we have made such
    and such a proposal but that there must be some initiative on
    his side too, then we can see if he is keen on it.</p>

    <p>If he is not keen on it, if it's all the same to him, if he
    has something else in mind, let him remain independent and me
    too.</p>

    <p>With a handshake for you and Mourier.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>What I'm inclined to think particularly strange in Gauguin's
    plan is this: The society <i>gives its protection in
    exchange</i> for ten pictures, which the artists have to
    <i>give</i>; if the artists did this, this Jew Society would
    pocket a good 100 pictures &ldquo;to begin with.&rdquo; Pretty
    dear, this protection by a society which doesn't even
    exist!</p>
