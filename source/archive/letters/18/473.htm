  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I'm in a fever of work since the trees are in blossom and I
    want to do a Proven&ccedil;al orchard full of enormous
    brightness. To write with a clear head presents serious
    difficulties. Yesterday I wrote some letters which I destroyed
    later. I keep on thinking that we must do something in Holland,
    and that we must set about it with the vigour of sans-culottes,
    with a French gaiety and worthy of the cause we are
    pleading.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">Here is a plan of attack which will cost us several of the
    best pictures you and I have made between us, and certainly
    worth at least several 1000 franc notes <sup>1</sup>. In any
    case they cost us money and a good piece of our lives.</p>

    <p>But it would be an answer in a clear voice to certain heavy
    insinuations, treating us as though we had already died, and a
    revenge for your trip last year, when the welcome that they
    made you lacked any warmth.</label> Enough.</p>

    <p>Suppose therefore that first of all we gave to Jet Mauve the
    <art id=0394>Souvenir de Mauve</art>. Suppose I dedicate a study
    to Breitner (I have <art id=0379>one exactly like the study</art>
    which I <art id=0378>exchanged with L. Pissarro</art> and the one
    <art id=0395>Reid has, of oranges, foreground white,
    background blue</art>.)</p>

    <p>Suppose we gave another study to our sister.</p>

    <p>Suppose that we gave the Modern Museum in The Hague, since
    we have many memories of The Hague, <art id=0350>the two views</art> of <art id=0316>Montmartre
    exhibited at the Independents</art>.</p>

    <p>One thing remains not so easily settled. Since Tersteeg has
    written you, &ldquo;Send me some impressionists, but only those
    pictures that you yourself judge to be the best,&rdquo; and on
    your part you sent a picture of mine in that consignment, I
    find myself in the not very easy position of having to
    <i>convince</i> Tersteeg that really I am a true impressionist
    of the Petit Boulevard, and that I intend to keep this
    position. Oh well, he will have a picture of mine in his own
    collection - I have been turning it over in my mind these days
    and I have found an odd thing, not like what I do every
    day.</p>

    <p><art id=0397>It is the drawbridge with the little yellow cart and the
    group of washerwomen, a study in which the ground is bright
    orange, the grass very green and the sky and water blue</art>.</p>

    <p>It only needs a frame specially designed for it in royal
    blue and gold, in this fashion</p>

    <p>the mount blue, the outside moulding gold; if necessary the
    frame could be in blue plush, but it would be better
    painted.</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin] Believe me, Tersteeg will not refuse
	the picture; I have made up my mind that this one, and the one
    for Jet Mauve, must go to Holland</p>

    <p>I think I can assure you that the work I do here is superior
    to than in the Asni&egrave;res country last spring.</p>

    <p>In the whole plan there is nothing absolutely fixed except
    the dedication <i>Souvenir de Mauve</i>, and the dedication to
    Tersteeg. I have not yet succeeded in writing a few words to
    explain it to him, but I will find them when the painting is
    done, they will come to me of themselves; but you well
    understand that we have the strength in us to make them talk
    about us if we choose, and we can go on with the work of
    launching the impressionists with the utmost calm and
    assurance.</p>

    <p>If you see Reid again, it would be good to tell him that we
    don't have a great deal of confidence in the success of
    ambitious people, and that we would like them better if they
    did good work, that we were surprised at his way of doing
    things which ended up being inexplicable and that since then we
    don't know what to think of him.</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin] For my part, I won't write to
    Tersteeg directly. If there is anything I will send the letter
    to you with the paintings.</p>

    <p>I believe that Russell is trying to reconcile me with Reid,
    and that he wrote the letter expressly for that purpose. I
    shall certainly write to Russell and tell him that I told Reid
    frankly that he made a foolish mistake in loving dead pictures
    and to count for nothing living artists. That moreover I hoped
    to see him change, at least in that respect.</p>

    <p>I had to spend almost the whole amount on colours and canvas
    as soon as your letter came, and I wish you could manage as
    soon as possible to send me something soon. <art id=0314>The painting of the
    garden with the lovers</art> is at the
    Th&eacute;atre Libre. Boyer, the framer, still has <art id=1662>a lithograph
    of mine: the old man with the bald head</art>.</p>

    <p>I should like it if what I am going to send you reached you
    before Tersteeg goes to Paris, and if you could put the
    blooming apple trees in your room. I'm very glad that it is
    working out all right with Koning and that you are not alone.
    What a pity about Vignon. I am sure M. Gendre was behind it,
    and I wish him, M. Gendre, the bad luck that he has brought on
    other people. It is a sad end for father Martin.</p>

    <p>I can't yet manage to write you the kind of letter I want
    to, the work absorbs me completely.</p>

    <p>But this is especially to tell you that I want to do some
    studies particularly for Holland, and after that we'll leave
    Holland alone for ever.</p>

    <p>The last few days I have been more moved than was reasonable
    perhaps, thinking about Mauve, and J. H. Weissenbruch, Tersteeg
    and Mother, and Wil; and it steadies me to tell myself that
    there'll be some pictures going down there. Then afterwards I
    shall forget them, and probably think only of the Petit
    Boulevard.</p>

    <p>[The end of the letter is missing]</p>

        <p>Vincent makes a play on words here: &ldquo;Blusiers
        pillets de mille vrans&rdquo;, transposing the first
        letters of &ldquo;Plusiers billets&rdquo; and writing
        &ldquo;francs&rdquo; with a `Dutch' accent.</p>
