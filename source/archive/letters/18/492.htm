  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Your letter of this morning gave me great pleasure. Thank
    you very much for the 100-franc note enclosed.</p>

    <p>And I am glad that the case has arrived.</p>

    <p>If you think the <art id=0394>Souvenir de Mauve</art> tolerable, you should put
    it in the next lot for The Hague, in a plain white frame.</p>

    <p>If you find among them a study that seems to you more
    suitable for Tersteeg, you can put it in without any dedication
    and keep <art id=0397>the one with his dedication, which you can then scrape
    off. Because it is better to give him one without any
    dedication.</art> Then he can pretend that he hadn't realized it was
    a present and can send it back without saying anything if he
    would rather not have anything from me.</p>

    <p>I certainly must offer him one to show that I have some zeal
    for the cause and that I appreciate his taking it up - but
    anyway, however it goes, whether you send one with or without a
    dedication, or send another one, it is all the same to me. Only
    as Mauve and he were such close friends, it seemed to come
    naturally to me, in the emotion of the moment, to do something
    for Tersteeg while I was doing a souvenir of Mauve. And that's
    the only thing I had in mind. That's all.</p>

    <p><art id=0513>The study of the orchard you speak of - where there is a lot
    of stippling</art> - is half of the principal subject for the scheme
    of decoration. <art id=0551>The other half is the study of the same size,
    without stretchers.</art></p>

    <p>And between them they should give some idea of the
    arrangement of the orchards here. Only I myself thought one
    study too soft and the other too harsh, both of them failures.
    It was partly due to the changeable weather, and then I was
    like the Russian who tried to gobble too much of the country in
    one day's march.</p>

    <p>I am very curious to see the results of Gruby's system - in
    the long run - say, after a year's trial. It would be wise to
    go and show yourself to him sometimes, and chat with him, and
    <i>really</i> to catch his <i>attention</i>, a really serious
    effort on his part, just as B. at last managed to get his
    sympathy and a more serious interest. Then I'd be happier about
    you. Now I cannot be.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">These people's proposal to send you on short journeys across
    the water is terribly upsetting to you.</label> And I accuse myself of
    upsetting you too - with my continual need of money.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">It seems to me that what these people ask of you would be
    reasonable enough if they first agreed to give you a year's
    leave (on full pay) to regain your health. You would devote
    that year to going around and revisiting all the impressionists
    and the impressionist collectors. That would still be working
    in the interests of Boussod &amp; Co. And after that you'd set
    off with a steadier health and nerves, and be able to start
    fresh business there.</label></p>

    <p>But taking the chestnuts out of the fire for these people in
    your present condition means utterly exhausting yourself within
    a year. And that's no good to anyone.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.death">My dear fellow, the Moslem idea that death comes only when
    it must - but that is a question - for my part I think that we
    have no proof of any direct management from above in this
    matter. On the contrary, I think there is proof that good
    hygiene not only prolongs life, but above all can make it more
    serene, a clearer stream; whereas bad hygiene not only muddies
    the current of life, but that in addition the absolute lack of
    it may put an end to life before its time. Didn't I myself see
    a very fine man die before my eyes for want of an intelligent
    doctor; he was so calm and serene through it all, but he kept
    on saying, &ldquo;If only I had another doctor,&rdquo; and he
    died with a shrug of the shoulders and a look I shall never
    forget.</label></p>

    <p>Would you like me to go to America with you? It would be
    only fair for these people to pay my passage.</p>

    <p>I am indifferent to most things, but not to this - that you
    should first of all really regain your health.</p>

    <p>But I think that once again you must steep yourself more and
    more in nature and in the world of artists.</p>

    <p>And I would rather see you independent of the Goupils, and
    dealing with the impressionists on your own account, than this
    other life of travelling around with expensive pictures
    belonging to these people. When our uncle was their partner, he
    got plenty out of it for some years - but look what it cost
    him.</p>

    <p>As for you, your lungs are all right - but, but, but&hellip;
    a year of Gruby first, and then you will see the danger you are
    now running. At present you have had ten years of Paris, which
    is more than enough.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you will tell me that D&eacute;taille, for instance,
    has had thirty years of Paris, and that he is as fit as a
    fiddle. Very well, do the same if you have similar powers, I
    won't object, and our family is tough.</p>

    <p>All that I want to say comes to this - if these people want
    you to pull their chestnuts out of the fire at such a distance,
    either make them pay you well, or refuse, and go over to the
    impressionists, doing less business as far as your financial
    turnover goes, but living more with nature.</p>

    <p>As for me, I am feeling decidedly better, and my digestion
    has improved tremendously during the past month. Some days I
    still suffer from unaccountable, involuntary fits of excitement
    or else utter sluggishness, but that will pass as I get calmer.
    I expect to make an excursion to Saintes-Maries, and see the
    Mediterranean at last.</p>

    <p>I am sure our sister will be delighted to come to Paris, and
    it will do her no harm, no doubt of that.</p>

    <p>I wish everybody would come South like me. I am always
    reproaching myself that my painting is not worth what it
    costs.</p>

    <p>But I must work, only remember that if ever circumstances
    make it desirable for me to go into trade instead, provided it
    will relieve you, I will do so without regret. Mourier will
    give you two more drawings.</p>

    <p>You know what you must do with these drawings - make
    sketchbooks with 6 or 10 or 12 like those books of original
    Japanese drawings. <i>I very much want</i> to make such a book
    for Gauguin, and one for Bernard. For the drawings are going to
    be better than these.</p>

    </p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Today I bought some paints here, and some canvases, for with
    the weather we are having I must return to the charge. That is
    another reason why there is nothing urgent in the list of
    colours except the ten large tubes of white.</label></p>

    <p>Odd, but one evening recently at Mont Majour I saw a red
    sunset, its rays falling on the trunks and foliage of pines
    growing among a jumble of rocks, colouring the trunks and
    foliage with orange fire, while the other pines in the distance
    stood out in Prussian blue against a sky of tender blue-green,
    cerulean. It was just the effect of that Claude Monet; it was
    superb. The white sand and the layers of white rocks under the
    trees took on tints of blue. What I would like to do is the
    panorama of which you have the first drawings. It has such
    breadth and then it doesn't change into grey, it remains green
    to the last line - and then the range of hills, blue.</p>

    <p>Today we have had a gale and rain, but it will only do good.
    If Koning prefers a painted study, do just as things turn
    out.</p>

    <p>Think well before you agree to everything that the Goupils
    are asking, and if it entails a change for me, really, now that
    my health is improving, I can work anywhere, and have no fixed
    prejudice on the subject.</p>

    <p>A handshake for you and Koning.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I think <art id=0403>that <i>white</i> orchard needs a white frame, cold
    white and rough</art>. Remember that I would far rather give up
    painting than see you killing yourself to make money. One must
    have it, to be sure - but has it come to the point where we
    must go so far to find it?</p>

    <p>You understand so well that &ldquo;to prepare oneself for
    death,&rdquo; the Christian idea (happily for him, Christ
    himself, it seems to me, had no trace of it, loving as he did
    people and things here below to an unreasonable extent, at
    least according to the folk who can only see him as a little
    cracked) - if you understand so well that to prepare oneself
    for death is idle - let it go for what it's worth -<label content="feelings.suicide"> can't you
    see that similarly self-sacrifice, living for other people, is
    a mistake if it involves suicide, for in that case you actually
    turn your friends into murderers.</label></p>

    <p>So if it has come to this, that you have to travel around
    like this, with never any peace, it honestly kills any desire
    in me to get back my own ease of mind.</p>

    <p>If you agree to these proposals, all right - but then ask
    these Goupils to take me on again, at my old wages, and take me
    with you on these journeys. People matter more than things, and
    the more trouble I take over pictures, the more pictures in
    themselves leave me cold. The reason why I try to make them is
    to be among the artists. You understand, it would make me
    wretched to be forcing you to make money. Rather, let's be
    together whatever happens. Where there's a will there`s a way,
    and I think if you can get well now, you will be well for quite
    a number of years. But don't kill yourself now, either for me
    or for anybody else. You know the portrait of the elder Six,
    the man going away, his glove in his hand. Well, <i>live</i>
    until you go away like that; I can see you do so, married. You
    would carry it off well. Think it over, and consult Gruby
    before you accept such a proposal.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
