  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just mailed <art id=1463>the sketch</art> of the new
    picture, <art id=0463>the &ldquo;Night Caf&eacute;,&rdquo;</art> as well as
    another that I did some time ago. I shall end perhaps by making
    some cr&eacute;pons.</p>

    <p>Well now, yesterday I was busy furnishing the house. Just as
    the postman and his wife told me, the two beds, to be really
    substantial, will come to 150 fr. apiece. I found everything
    that they told me about prices was true. So I had to change my
    tack, and this is what I have done. I have bought one walnut
    bed and another in white deal which will be mine and which I'll
    paint later.</p>

    <p>Then I got bedclothes for one of the beds, and two
    mattresses.</p>

    <p>If Gauguin comes, or someone else, there is his bed ready in
    a minute. I wanted to arrange the house from the start not for
    myself only, but so as to be able to put someone else up too.
    Naturally this has swallowed up the greater part of the money.
    With the rest I have bought 12 chairs, a mirror and some small
    necessities. Altogether it means that next week already I shall
    be able to go and live there.</p>

    <p>For a visitor there will be the prettier room upstairs,
    which I shall try to make as much as possible like the boudoir
    of a really artistic woman.</p>

    <p>Then there will be my own bedroom, which I want extremely
    simple, but with large, solid furniture, the bed, chairs and
    table all in white deal.</p>

    <p>Downstairs will be the studio, and another room, a studio
    too, but at the same time a kitchen.</p>

    <p>Someday or other you shall have a picture of the little
    house itself in bright sunshine, or else with the window lit
    up, and a starry sky.</p>

    <p>Henceforth you can feel that you have your country house in
    Arles. For I am very anxious to arrange it so that you will be
    pleased with it, and so that it will be a studio in an
    absolutely individual style; that way, if say a year from now
    you come here and to Marseilles for your vacation, it will be
    ready then, and the house, as I intend it, will be full of
    pictures from top to bottom.</p>

    <p>The room you will have then, or Gauguin if he comes, will
    have white walls with a decoration of great yellow
    sunflowers.</p>

    <p>In the morning, when you open the window, you see the green
    of the gardens and the rising sun, and the road into the
    town.</p>

    <p>But you will see these great pictures of the sunflowers, 12
    or 14 to the bunch, crammed into this tiny boudoir with its
    pretty bed and everything else dainty. It will not be
    commonplace.</p>

    <p>And in the studio, the red tiles of the floor, the walls and
    ceiling white, rustic chairs, white deal table, and I hope a
    decoration of portraits. It will have a feeling of Daumier
    about it, and I dare predict it will not be commonplace.</p>

    <p>And now do look for some lithographs of Daumier's for the
    studio, and some Japanese things, but there is no hurry at all
    for that; it's only when you find duplicates of them. And some
    things of Delacroix's, and ordinary lithographs by modern
    artists.</p>

    <p>There is not the slightest hurry, but I have my own plan. I
    want to make it really <i>an artists' house</i> - not precious,
    on the contrary nothing <i>precious</i>, but everything from
    the chairs to the pictures having character.</p>

    <p>About the beds, I have bought country beds, big double ones
    instead of iron ones. That gives an appearance of solidity,
    durability and quiet, and if it takes a little more bedding, so
    much the worse, but it must have character.</p>

    <p>I am very lucky to have a faithful charwoman; except for
    that I should not have dared to begin living at home; she is
    quite old and has many and varied offspring, and she keeps my
    tiles clean and red.</p>

    <p>I cannot tell you how much pleasure it gives me to find a
    big serious job like this. For it's going to be, I hope, a real
    scheme of decoration that I'm starting on now.</p>

    <p>As I already told you, I am going to paint my own bed; there
    will be three subjects on it. Perhaps a nude woman, I haven't
    yet decided, or perhaps a child in a cradle, I don't know, but
    I shall take my time over it.</p>

    <p>I don't feel any hesitation now about staying here, because
    ideas for my work are coming to me in abundance. I intend to
    buy something for the house every month. And with some patience
    the house will be worth something because of the furniture and
    the decorations.</p>

    <p>I must warn you that soon I shall have to send a big order
    for paints for the autumn, which I think is going to be
    absolutely amazing. On second thought I am sending you the
    order enclosed.</p>

    <p>In my picture of the &ldquo;Night Caf&eacute;&rdquo; I have
    tried to express the idea that the caf&eacute; is a place where
    one can ruin oneself, go mad or commit a crime. So I have tried
    to express, as it were, the powers of darkness in a low public
    house, by soft Louis XV green and malachite, contrasting with
    yellow-green and harsh blue-greens, and all this in an
    atmosphere like a devil's furnace, of pale sulphur.</p>

    <p>And all with an appearance of Japanese gaiety, and the good
    nature of Tartarin.</p>

    <p>But what would Monsieur Tersteeg say about this picture when
    he said before a Sisley - Sisley, the most discreet and gentle
    of the impressionists - &ldquo;I can't help thinking that the
    artist who painted that was a little tipsy.&rdquo; If he saw my
    picture, he would say that it was delirium tremens in full
    swing.</p>

    <p>I see absolutely nothing to object to in your suggestion of
    exhibiting once at the Revue Ind&eacute;pendente, provided,
    however, that I am no obstacle to the others who usually
    exhibit there.</p>

    <p>Only then we ought to tell them that I should like to
    reserve for myself a second exhibition after this first one, of
    studies proper. Then next year I will give them the decorations
    of the house to exhibit when they are complete. Not that I am
    so keen on it, but in order that the studies should not be
    confused with finished compositions, and so as to announce in
    advance that the second exhibition will be one of
    <i>studies</i>. For so far hardly any of them except the
    &ldquo;Sower&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Night Caf&eacute;&rdquo; are
    attempts at finished pictures.</p>

    <p>Just as I'm writing to you, the poor peasant who is like a
    caricature of Father happens to have come into the caf&eacute;.
    The resemblance is terrible, all the same. Especially the
    uncertainty and the weariness and the vagueness of the mouth. I
    still feel it is a pity that I have not been able to do it.</p>

    <p>I add to this letter an order for paints which is not
    exactly urgent. But I have so many plans in my head, and the
    autumn promises to give so many magnificent subjects, that I
    simply do not know if I am going to start five canvases or ten.
    It will be just as it was in the spring with the orchards in
    bloom, there will be no end of subjects.</p>

    <p>If you gave old Tanguy the coarser colour, he would probably
    do it well.</p>

    <p>The other fine colours are really inferior, especially the
    blues.</p>

    <p>I hope to have improved a little in quality when I prepare
    the next batch. I am doing comparatively less, and going back
    over them longer.</p>

    <p>I have kept 50 francs for the week, so there have been 250
    for the furnishing already. But all the same I shall recover
    them, carrying on like this. And now you can tell yourself that
    you have a sort of country house, though unfortunately rather
    far away.<label content="business.selling"> But it would cease to be very, very far if there were
    a permanent exhibition in Marseilles. Perhaps in a year's time
    we shall see that.</label></p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
