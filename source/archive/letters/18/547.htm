    <p>Letter 547<br>
     Arles, 8 October 1888 (includes last part of 546)</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>My whole mind, like yours, is set on Gauguin now. And like
    you, I hope that he will come right away.</p>

    <p><i>This is great about Bague!</i></p>

    <p>Not that it amazes me, but I am pleased for Bague, for I
    always thought him the <i>penitent</i> thief.</p>

    <p>So if you happen to see him - and if you don't, then go on
    purpose - let him know that I have <art id=0474>a &ldquo;Starry
    Night,&rdquo;</art> <art id=0574>the &ldquo;Furrows,&rdquo;</art> <art id=0468>the &ldquo;Poet's
    Garden,&rdquo;</art> <art id=0475>the &ldquo;Vineyard.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>In short, romantic landscapes.</p>

    <p>Do not say too much about the studies, which certainly are
    more trouble to do, but are less saleable. If you had sent me
    200 fr. I should have done the same thing with the sea at
    Stes-Maries.</p>

    <p>We are now in the midst of a merciless mistral, it is very
    bad for the work. But later, before the real winter, we shall
    have more fine weather, and in any case I hope to add other
    things to the series I am working on.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I have left today out of the money you sent
    this very day? Well, I have 6 francs.</p>

    <p>I asked you to send it to me on Friday, and I only received
    your letter <i>four</i> days later, on Monday noon.</p>

    <p>It is mostly the fault of the frames, which I have already
    ordered, and which I need very badly. I can only finish in a
    frame. And besides, we may make use of them in Marseilles.</p>

    <p>I have three kinds of wood, walnut, chestnut and pine, for
    the frames.</p>

    <p>And if you see him, do give Bague my kind regards, and tell
    him that I recommend him my &ldquo;Vineyard&rdquo; and my
    &ldquo;Starry Night.&rdquo; And the same to Tripp. Didn't they
    buy a lot from Mauve, didn't they even buy Mauve's last big
    water colours at a good price? I do not know, it is so long
    since I saw anything of them. But in the past I never quarreled
    with either Tripp or Bague.</p>

    <p><label content="business.sales">Only, while not saying too much about the first two batches,
    tell Bague that I am very pleased he has bought that study, and
    that I shall be doing studies as long as the autumn is
    propitious, and that I want him to come and see them when we
    send them with some Gauguins.</label></p>

    <p>As for Thomas, I think it would be the right thing to go and
    see him.</p>

    <p>I have just written that, all told, I have 6 francs
    left.</p>

    <p>Is that enough for a week? No.</p>

    <p>So I really beg you to send me a louis, and that by return
    mail, please. That will give me 16 francs for the week, and
    then I shall manage to get through. <i>But do not delay</i>.
    Besides, I must be ready to work as soon as the fine weather
    appears. We have an absolutely merciless mistral, but I must
    hold myself in readiness, the work is done in short intervals.
    So that everything must be prepared and ready for the
    attack.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support"><i>Tasset has not sent any canvas</i>. It is very, very
    urgent, do please order 10 or at any rate 5 meters from him at
    once.</p>

    <p>It is very urgent, because already I have bought some canvas
    here so as to be ready for tomorrow or the day after, according
    to what the weather will be. The thing is that you must take
    advantage of the intervals in the mistral and be ready
    beforehand.</label></p>

    <p>My dear Theo, a thousand thanks for the paints and your
    letter of today.</p>

    <p>The work holds me in its grip, and I am sure I shall not
    lose by it if I can go on like this, the big canvases are all
    good.</p>

    <p>But they are exhausting too.</p>

    <p>Herewith yesterday's letter which I am sending you, such as
    it is. From it you will see what I think of <art id=auguinsp>Gauguin's portrait</art>.
    Too dark, too sad.</p>

    <p>I do not say that I do not like it as it is, but he will
    change, and he must come. Yes, indeed, they spend less than I,
    yes - but - if I was with two others as he is - if he spent a
    little more it would be better. Once more, one must not do
    flesh with Prussian blue. Because then it ceases to be flesh;
    it becomes wood. And there is nothing so urgent for Gauguin,
    nothing better for him to do, than to join me. However, I
    venture to think that with regard to colouring, the other
    Breton pictures will be better than the portrait he has sent
    me, done, after all, in haste. And I am far from judging
    studies such as that. However, you will see for yourself.</p>

    <p>Say, if you can, don't let me be so hard up all the week. If
    you can, send me another louis. I don't quite know how to
    manage without it.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
