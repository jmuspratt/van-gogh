    <p>Letter W09<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Arles, c. 16 November 1888</p>

    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p>It gave me much pleasure to receive a reply from Mrs. Mauve
    at last. As I want to write her a letter one of these days,
    kindly send me her present address at once and without fail.
    Her letter was dated from The Hague, but she does not say
    whether she is going to stay there; my impression was that she
    was going to stay at Laren. She told me that she had received a
    nice letter from you.</p>

    <p>I received the letter dated from Middelharnis, and I thank
    you very much for it. It is a very good thing that you have at
    least started to read Au bonheur des dames, and so on. There
    are a lot of things in it - as in Guy de Maupassant too, for
    that matter.</p>

    <p><?showImage("699_V-W_W090");?>
     I have already answered you that I don't like Mother's picture
    enormously.</p>

    <p>I have just finished painting, to put in my bedroom,<art id=0496> a
    memory of the garden at Etten</art>; here is a
    sketch of it. It is a rather large canvas.</p>

    <p>Here are the details of the colours. The younger of the two
    ladies who are out for a walk is wearing a Scottish shawl with
    green and orange checks, and a red parasol. The old lady has a
    violet shawl, nearly black. But a bunch of dahlias, some of
    them citron yellow, the others pink and white mixed, are like
    an explosion of colour on the somber figure. Behind them a few
    cedar shrubs and emerald-green cypresses. Behind the cypresses
    one sees a field of pale green and red cabbages, surrounded by
    a border of little white flowers. The sandy path is of a raw
    orange colour; the foliage of the two beds of scarlet geraniums
    is very green. Finally, the interjacent plane, there is a
    maid-servant, dressed in blue, who is arranging a profusion of
    plants with white, pink, yellow and vermilion-red flowers.</p>

    <p>Here you are. I know this is hardly what one might call a
    likeness, but for me it renders the poetic character and the
    style of the garden as I feel it. All the same, let us suppose
    that the two ladies out for a walk are you and our mother; let
    us even suppose that there is not the least, absolutely not the
    least vulgar and fatuous resemblance - yet the deliberate
    choice of colour, the somber violet with the blotch of violent
    citron yellow of the dahlias, suggests Mother's personality to
    me.</p>

    <p>The figure in the Scotch plaid with orange and green checks
    stands out against the somber green of the cypress, which
    contrast is further accentuated by the red parasol - this
    figure gives me an impression of you like those in Dickens's
    novels, a vaguely representative figure.</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">I don't know whether you can understand that one may make a
    poem only by arranging colours, in the same way that you can
    say comforting things in music.</p>

    <p>In a similar manner the bizarre lines, purposely selected
    and multiplied, meandering all through the picture, may fail to
    give the garden a vulgar resemblance, but may present it to our
    minds as seen in a dream, depicting its character, and at the
    same time stranger than it is in reality.</label></p>

    <p>I have also <art id=0497>painted &ldquo;Une Liseuse de Romans,&rdquo; the
    luxuriant hair very black, a green bodice, the sleeves the
    colour of wine lees, the skirt black, the background all
    yellow, bookshelves with books. She is holding a yellow book in
    her hands</art>.</p>

    <p><?showImage("699_V-W_W091");?>
     So much for today. But remember I have not told you that my
    friend Paul Gauguin, an impressionist painter, is now living
    with me, and that we are very happy together. He strongly
    encourages me to work often from pure imagination.</p>

    <p>Give my kindest regards to Mother, and do not fail to send
    me Mrs. Mauve's address by return mail.</p>

    <p>I embrace you in thought, Mother and you.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
