  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I think you were right to go to our uncle's funeral, since
    Mother seemed to be expecting you. <label content="attitude.death">The best way to tackle a
    death is to swallow the image of the illustrious dead, whatever
    he was, as the best man in the best of all possible worlds,
    where everything is always for the best.</label> Which not being
    contested, and consequently incontestable, it is doubtless
    allowable for us to return afterwards to our own affairs. I am
    glad that our brother Cor has grown bigger and stronger than
    the rest of us. And he must be stupid if he does not get
    married, for he has nothing but that and his hands. With that
    and his hands, and that and what he knows of machinery, I for
    one would like to be in his shoes, if I had any desire at all
    to be anyone else.</p>

    <p>And meanwhile I am in my own hide, and my hide within the
    cog-wheels of the Fine Arts, like corn between the
    mill-stones.</p>

    <p>Did I tell you that I had sent the drawings to friend
    Russell? At the moment I am doing practically the same ones
    again for you, there will be twelve likewise. You will then see
    better what there is in the painted studies in the way of
    drawing.<label content="art.technique"> I have already told you that I always have to fight
    against the mistral, which makes it absolutely impossible to be
    master of your stroke. That accounts for the
    &ldquo;haggard&rdquo; look of the studies. You will tell me
    that instead of drawing them, I ought to paint them again on
    fresh canvases at home. I think so myself now and then, for it
    is not my fault in this case that the execution lacks a
    livelier touch. What would Gauguin say about it if he were
    here, would he advise seeking a more sheltered place?</label></p>

    <p>I now have another unpleasant thing to tell you about the
    money, which is that I shall <i>not</i> manage this week,
    because this very day I am paying out 25 Frs.; I shall have
    money for five days, but not for seven. This is Monday; if I
    get your next letter on Saturday morning there will be no need
    to increase the enclosure. Last week I did not one only but two
    portraits of my postman,<art id=0432> a half-length with the hands</art>, and a
    <art id=0433>head, life size</art>. The good
    fellow, as he would not accept money, <i>cost more</i> eating
    and drinking with me, and I gave him besides the
    &ldquo;Lantern&rdquo; by Rochefort. But that is a trifling and
    immaterial evil, considering that he posed very well, and that
    I expect to paint his baby very shortly, for his wife has just
    been brought to bed.</p>

    <p>I will send you, at the same time as the drawings that I
    have in hand, two lithographs by de Lemud, &ldquo;Wine&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;The Caf&eacute;&rdquo;; in &ldquo;Wine&rdquo; there
    is a sort of Mephistopheles, rather reminiscent of C.M. when
    younger, and in &ldquo;The Caf&eacute;&rdquo;&hellip;it is
    Raoul exactly, you know that old Bohemian student type, whom I
    knew last year. What a talent that de Lemud had, like Hoffman
    or Edgar Poe. And yet he is one who is little talked of.
    Perhaps you will not care tremendously for these lithographs at
    first, but it is just when you look at them for a long time
    that they grow on you.</p>

    <p>I have come to the end both of paints and canvas and I have
    already had to buy some here. And I must go back for still
    more. So please do send the letter so that I'll have it on
    Saturday morning.</p>

    <p>Today I am probably going to begin on the interior of the
    caf&eacute; where I have a room , by gas light, in the
    evening.</p>

    <p>It is what they call here a &ldquo;caf&eacute; de
    nuit&rdquo; (they are fairly frequent here), staying open all
    night. &ldquo;Night prowlers&rdquo; can take refuge there when
    they have no money to pay for a lodging, or are too drunk to be
    taken in. All those things - family, native land - are perhaps
    more attractive in the imaginations of such people as us, who
    pretty well do without native land or family either, than they
    are in reality. I always feel I am a traveller, going somewhere
    and to some destination. If I tell myself that the somewhere
    and the destination do not exist, that seems to me very
    reasonable and likely enough.</p>

    <p>The brothel keeper, when he kicks anyone out, has similar
    logic, argues as well, and is always right, I know. So at the
    end of my career I shall find my mistake. So be it. I shall
    find then that not only the Arts, but everything else as well,
    were only dreams, that one's self was nothing at all. If we are
    <i>as flimsy as that</i>, so much the better for us, for then
    there is nothing against the unlimited possibility of future
    existence. <label subject="attitude.death">Whence comes it that, in the present instance of our
    uncle's death, the face of the dead was calm, peaceful, and
    grave, while it is a fact that while living he was scarcely
    like that, either in youth or age. I have often observed a like
    effect as I looked at the dead as though to question them. And
    that for me is one proof, though not the most serious, of a
    life beyond the grave.</label></p>

    <p>And in the same way a child in the cradle, if you watch it
    at leisure, has the infinite in its eyes. In short, I know
    <i>nothing</i> about it, but it is just this feeling of <i>not
    knowing</i> that makes the real life we are actually living now
    like a one-way journey in a train. You go fast, but cannot
    distinguish any object very close up, and above all you do not
    see the engine.</p>

    <p>It is rather curious that Uncle as well as Father believed
    in the future life. Not to mention Father, I have several times
    heard Uncle arguing about it.</p>

    <p>Ah - but then, they were more assured than us, and were
    affirmers who got angry if you dared to go deeper.</p>

    <p>Of the <i>future</i> life of artists <i>through their
    works</i> I do not think much. Yes, artists perpetuate
    themselves by handing on the torch, Delacroix to the
    impressionists, etc. But is that all?</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.Mother">If the kind old mother of a family, with ideas that are
    pretty well limited and tortured by the Christian system, is to
    be immortal as she believes, and seriously too - and I for one
    do not gainsay it - why should a consumptive or neurotic cab
    horse like Delacroix and de Goncourt, with broad ideas, be any
    less immortal?</label></p>

    <p>Granted that it seems just that the most destitute should
    feel the most the springing of this unaccountable hope.</p>

    <p>Enough. What is the good of worrying about it? But living in
    the full tide of civilization, of Paris, of the Arts, why
    should not one keep this &ldquo;Ego&rdquo; of the old women, if
    women themselves without their instinctive belief that
    &ldquo;<i>so it is</i>,&rdquo; would not find strength to
    create or to act?</p>

    <p>Then the doctors will tell us that not only Moses, Mahomet,
    Christ, Luther, Bunyan and others were mad, but also Frans
    Hals, Rembrandt, Delacroix, and also all the dear narrow old
    women like our mother.</p>

    <p>Ah - that's a serious matter - one might ask these doctors;
    where then are the sane people?</p>

    <p>Are they the brothel keepers who are always right? Probably.
    Then what to choose? Fortunately there is no choice.</p>

    <p>With a handshake.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
