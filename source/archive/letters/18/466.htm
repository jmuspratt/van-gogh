  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>With great pleasure I received your letter and the rough draft of the
    letter to Tersteeg and the 50-fr. note.</p>

    <p>Your letter to Tersteeg was just right in the draft; I hope
    you won't have to chop it about too much when you make the fair
    copy.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">It seems to me that your letter to Tersteeg complements
    mine, I regretted the state in which I posted it. For you
    will have seen that the idea of making Tersteeg take the
    initiative in introducing the impressionists into England only
    came to me while I was actually writing the letter, and it
    was only inadequately expressed in a P. S. in hindsight.
    Whereas you explain to him this idea in detail in your letter. Will
    he understand? Hang it, that's his own lookout.</label></p>

    <p>I have had a letter from Gauguin which says that he has been
    sick in bed for a fortnight [GAC 28]. That he is on the rocks since he has
    had to pay some noisy creditors. That he wants to know if you have
    sold anything for him, but he can't write to you for fear of
    bothering you. He is so pressed for a little money that he
    would be ready to reduce the price of his paintings even
    more.</p>

    <p>The only thing I can do in this business is to write to
    Russell, and I am going to do this today.</p>

    <p>And after all we have already tried to make Tersteeg buy
    one. But what is to be done? He must be hard pressed. I send
    you a line for him in case you have anything to write him
    about, only you must open any letters that come from him for me, because
    in that way you will know the contents sooner, and save me the
    trouble of repeating them to you. I'm telling you this once and
    for all.</p>

    <p>Would you risk taking his marine for the firm? If that were
    possible, he would be safe for the moment.</p>

    <p>It is a very good thing that you have taken in young Koning,
    I am so glad that you are not going to be alone in your
    apartment. In Paris one is always as down in the mouth as a cab
    horse, and if on top of that one has to stay all alone in the
    stable, it's too much.</p>

    <p>For the exhibition of the Independents, do as you think best.
    What do you say to showing the <art id=0350>two big landscapes</art>
    of <art id=0316>the butte Montmartre?</art> It is
    all more or less the same to me. I am counting rather more on
    the work from this year.</p>

    <p>Down here it is freezing hard and there is still snow
    in the countryside. I have <art id=0391>a study of a white landscape
    with the town in the background</art>. Then <art id=0392>2
    small studies</art> of <art id=0393>an almond-tree branch already in flower in spite
    of it.</art></p>

    <p>So much for today. I am also going to write a note to
    Koning.</p>

    <p>Indeed I am very glad that you wrote to Tersteeg, and
    I hope that this will mean a revival of your business relations
    with Holland.</p>

    <p>With a handshake to you and to the comrades you happen
    to meet.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
