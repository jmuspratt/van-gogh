  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter of today, and for the 110-franc
    note it contained. As for the earlier letter with the 50
    francs, I got it too, and I wrote you about it the day, or two
    days, before I sent <art id=1516>the two drawings</art>. <art id=1414>These drawings</art> were made
    with a reed sharpened the way you would a goose quill; I intend
    to make a series of them, and hope to do better ones than the
    first two. It is a method that I had already tried in Holland
    some time ago, but I hadn't such good reeds there as here.</p>

    <p>I have had a letter from Koning, please thank him for it; I
    shall be very pleased to exchange the two drawings for one of
    his studies, which you must choose and keep in your collection.
    I will write him to explain the method and send him some
    sharpened reeds so that he can try it too.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">This is important news - your journey to Brussels. You will
    be able to judge how the old high-priced stuff is going there.</label>
    But what a business! For probably these fellows are planning
    some move. Do you remember that we talked about it before I
    left, and said that in expectation of the Universal Exhibition
    Bouguereau, Lef&egrave;vre, Benjamin C. [Constant], the whole set,
    would go to Boussod's to complain and to insist that they count
    on the firm of B's (the best in the world) remaining true and
    faithful to the principles of that art which is in truth the
    most civilized and most attractive - that is to say their own
    pictures.</p>

    <p>Whatever it may be, it was pretty disquieting. And the
    situation would become serious if you quarreled with these
    gentlemen.</p>

    <p>I don't disguise from you that it will be a pretty severe
    blow to you; not at the moment but say six months later,
    because of the change in your way of life that it would bring
    about.</p>

    <p>When a man comes out of prison after having been there a
    long time, there will be moments when he will even miss his
    prison, because he finds himself at a loss now that he is at
    liberty - so called, I suppose, because the grinding daily task
    of earning your living hardly leaves any liberty at all.</p>

    <p>But you know all this. You will certainly regret some things
    in spite of yourself, even while you are gaining others.</p>

    <p>I have ten orchards now, not counting three little studies,
    and one big one of a cherry tree, which I've spoiled.</p>

    <p>When will you be back and what exactly am I to do about
    sending things? - for I must get fresh subjects, as most of the
    flowering in the orchards is over.</p>

    <p>Therefore, these orchards, with <art id=0397>the Pont de l'Anglais</art>,
    constitute a first series. If you would rather leave them to
    dry out here, perhaps it would be as well. They are now on a
    covered terrace to dry. I say, Daumier is on view at the
    Beaux-Arts and Gavarni too, aren't they? Bravo for the Daumier,
    but not for the Beaux-Arts.</p>

    <p><?showImage("580_V-T_4780");?>
    </p>

    <p>Here is a sketch of <art id=0406>an orchard that I planned more
    particularly for you to celebrate May 1. It's absolutely clear,
    and done all in one go. A frenzy of impastos
    of the faintest yellow and lilac on the original white
    mass.</art></p>

    <p>You will probably be in Holland by then, and perhaps you
    will be seeing the same trees in flower there on that very
    day.</p>

    <p>I am very glad you have taken lessons in eating from young
    Koning. He is thoroughly well up on it: and it's amusing to eat
    with that budding young artist.</p>

    <p>I am very pleased that you have got his study of the Negress.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">But indeed, it will
    do you good to have breakfast. I do it
    here myself, and eat two eggs every morning.</label>
    <label subject="health.gastrointestinal.stomach">My stomach is
    very weak, but I hope to be able to get it right; it will take
    time and patience. In any case I am really much better already than in Paris.</label></p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">Besides, one doesn't
    really seem to need a great deal of
    food here, </label>and while I think of it, I want to tell you that
    more and more I doubt the truth of the legend of Monticelli
    drinking such enormous quantities of absinthe. When I look at
    his work, I can't think it possible that a man who was flabby
    with drink could have done that.</p>

    <p>Perhaps that Limoges woman, the La Roquette female, set her
    evil tongue wagging and so the legend took root.</p>

    <p>I am writing in haste so that you will get my letter before
    you leave, if it is this Sunday that you intend to start.</p>

    <p>Although I do not think that the journey will be very
    delightful if Delort &amp; Co.'s pictures are to be the bulk of
    the collection designed for the worthy Belgians, all the same I
    wish you a good time, and a good journey, and above all be of
    good heart.</p>

    <p>I saw Bernard's still life unfinished, and thought it
    magnificent.</p>

    <p>A handshake for you and Koning.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
