  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter enclosing 100 Fr.<label content="health.general"> I am very glad
    to have left those people, and since then I have been feeling
    much better</label>.<label content="food-and-drink.preference"> It was mainly their bad food which kept me down,
    and their wine, which was regular poison. I get a very good
    meal now for 1 franc or for 1.50.</label></p>

    <p><label content="art.support">Tasset's absorbent canvas would suit me much better if the
    canvas itself were three times as rough.</p>

    <p>If you meet the man, try to find out what he uses for
    plaster. I should not be surprised if he prepared his canvas
    with pipe clay. If I could find out about this, I think that I
    could prepare the canvas myself. There is no hurry, but try to
    find out. I still have 4 meters of canvas 1.20 m. wide, which I
    bought here, but it is not prepared.</label></p>

    <p>Next time I have paints sent, he could put some plaster in
    the same lot, enough to prepare 4 meters. But there is no hurry
    yet.</p>

    <p>When you got back, did our gentlemen say anything to you
    about making you travel for them?</p>

    <p>One of these days you will see the Danish painter who was
    here turning up in Paris, I don't know how to spell his name
    (Mories?). He is going to see the Salon, and then return home,
    and perhaps come back to the South after a year.</p>

    <p>His last three studies were better and more full of colour
    than what he had done before.</p>

    <p>I do not know what he will do in the future. But he is
    good-natured, and I am sorry he is going away. I told him that
    a Dutch painter was staying with you, and if Koning would take
    him to the Butte Montmartre, he would probably make some
    studies there.</p>

    <p>I talked to him a lot about the impressionists; he knew them
    all by name or from having seen their pictures, and he is very
    much interested. He has an introduction to Russell. His health
    has improved here, and he is very well now; he will be all
    right for two years, but after that it will do him good to come
    back here for his health's sake.</p>

    <p>What is the new book on Daumier, L'Homme et l'Oeuvre? Have
    you seen the exhibition of the caricaturists?</p>

    <p>I have done two new studies,<art id=0570> a bridge</art> and <art id=0567>the side of a high
    road</art>. Many subjects here are exactly like Holland in character, the difference is in the
    colour. There is that sulphur-yellow everywhere the sun lights.</p>

    <p>You will remember that we saw a magnificent garden of roses
    by Renoir. I was expecting to find subjects like that here, and
    indeed, it was that way while the orchards were in bloom. Now
    the appearance of things has changed and become much harsher.
    But the green, and the blue! I must say several landscapes of
    Cezanne's which I know render this very well, and I am sorry
    not to have seen more of them. The other day I saw a subject
    exactly like the lovely Monticelli landscape with the poplars
    which we saw at Reid's.</p>

    <p>You would probably have to go to Nice to find Renoir's
    gardens again. I have seen very few roses here, though there
    are some, among them the big red roses called Rose de
    Provence.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it is already something to have found plenty of
    subjects - provided the pictures are worth what they cost. If
    the impressionists go up in value, it may happen. And at the
    end of several years' work we may be able to make up a bit for
    the past. And at the end of a year I shall have a quiet home of
    my own.</p>

    <p>I am anxious to know what you will say of what I have sent,
    I think it will take ten days by goods train from here to
    Paris. If there are any really too bad ones among them, don't
    show them! I only sent the lot to give you an idea of the
    things I have seen. I must go and look for a new subject, so,
    thanking you again very heartily for writing so soon, with a
    handshake for you and Koning,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
