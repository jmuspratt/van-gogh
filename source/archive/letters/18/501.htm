    <p>Arles, 21<sup>st</sup> June 1888</p>

    <p>My Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just read Geffray's article on Claude Monet. What he
    says is really very good. I should so like to see that
    exhibition! The only way I can console myself for not seeing it
    is to look round and see so many things in nature that I hardly
    have time to think of anything else, for just now it is
    harvesttime.</p>

    <p>I have had a letter from Bernard, who says that he is
    feeling very lonesome, but that he is working all the same, and
    has written a new poem on himself in which he makes fun of
    himself rather pathetically. And he asks, &ldquo;What's the use
    of working?&rdquo; Only he asks that <i>while he is
    working</i>; he says that work is no earthly good at all
    <i>while he is working</i>, which is not at all the same thing
    as saying it when one is not working: I should very much like
    to see what he is doing.</p>

    <p>I am curious to know what Gauguin will do if Bernard does
    not go back to him at Pont-Aven; I've given them each other's
    addresses up to now because they might need each other.</p>

    <p>I have had a week's hard, close work among the cornfields in
    the full sun. The result is some studies of cornfields,
    landscapes, and - a sketch of a sower.</p>

    <p><art id=0422>A ploughed field, a big field with clods of violet earth -
    climbing toward the horizon, a sower in blue and white. On the
    horizon a field of short ripe corn.</p>

    <p>Over it all a yellow sky with a yellow sun</art>.</p>

    <p>You can tell from this simple mentioning of the tones that
    it's a composition in which colour plays a very important
    part.</p>

    <p>And the sketch, such as it is - a size 25 canvas - torments
    me, making me wonder if I shouldn't attack it seriously and
    make a terrible picture of it.</p>

    <p>My Lord, how much would I like to do it. But I keep asking
    myself if I have vigour enough to carry it out.</p>

    <p>Such as it is, I am putting the sketch to one side, hardly
    daring to think about it. I have been longing to do a sower for
    such a long time, but the things I've wanted for a long time
    never come off. And so I am almost afraid of it. And yet, after
    Millet and Lhermitte, what still remains to be done is - a
    sower, in colour and large size.</p>

    <p>Let's talk of something else - I have a model at last - a
    Zouave - a boy with a small face, a bull neck, and the eye of a
    tiger, and I began with one portrait, and began again with
    another; <art id=0423>the half-length I did of him was horribly harsh</art>, in a
    blue uniform, the blue of enamel saucepans, with braids of a
    faded reddish-orange, and two yellow stars on his breast, an
    ordinary blue, and very hard to do. That
    bronzed, feline head of his with a red cap, I placed it against
    a green door and the orange bricks of a wall. So it's a savage
    combination of incongruous tones, not easy to manage. The study
    I made of it seems to me very harsh, but all the same I'd like
    always to be working on vulgar, even loud portraits like this.
    It teaches me something, and above all that is what I want of
    my work. The <art id=0424>second portrait will be full length, sitting
    against a white wall.</art></p>

    <p>Did you notice in the Dessins Raffaeli, &ldquo;The
    Street,&rdquo; published lately in the Figaro? The main one -
    you would say it was the Place Clichy with all its bustle - is
    very much alive. Figaro is said to have published a number with
    Caran d'Ache's drawings.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I forgot to tell you in my last letter that I received -
    it's a fortnight ago now - the consignment of paints from
    Tasset. I shall need a fresh batch, since these studies of
    wheat fields and Zouaves have fairly devoured my tubes.</p>

    <p>Only <i>a third or a half</i> is urgent.</label></p>

    <p>Among the studies of wheat fields <art id=0425>there is one of the
    stacks</art>, of which I sent you <art id=1425>the first sketch</art>; it is on a square
    size 30 canvas.</p>

    <p>We have had torrential rain these last two days, which has
    gone on all day, and will change the appearance of the fields.
    It came absolutely unexpectedly and suddenly, while everyone
    was harvesting. They brought in a great part of the wheat just
    as it was.</p>

    <p>I am hoping to go for a trip into the Camargue next Friday
    with a veterinary surgeon; there are bulls there and wild white
    horses, and pink flamingos too. I shouldn't be surprised if it
    was very beautiful.</p>

    <p>There is no desperate hurry for the canvas either.</p>

    <p>I am very curious to know what Gauguin will do, but to risk
    persuading him to come - no - for I do not know if it would
    suit him. And perhaps when you consider his large family, it is
    more his duty to try to bring off something that would bring in
    enough to let him be the head of the family again.</p>

    <p>In any case, I certainly do not want to cramp anybody's
    individuality by any association, and if he is hankering after
    that plunge he mentioned, he may have good reason for it, and I
    should not like to deter him if he is really set on it, which
    remains to be seen. We may find that out from his reply.</p>

    <p>Good-bye for the present. A handshake, and thank you for the
    paper, and good luck with your exhibition.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent.</p>

    <p>What is old Tanguy doing? Have you seen him lately? I am
    always glad to get paints from him, even if they are just a
    little worse than elsewhere, provided however that they are not
    too expensive.</p>

    <p>Letter 535a</p>

    <p>Arles, 21 June 1888</p>

    <p>Here is the letter for Gauguin - I know that there is the
    following passage in the letter:<label content="business.co-op"> &ldquo;I <i>insist</i> that,
    supposing the capital is got together, or half of it got
    together, your brother will exert his powers to lead the
    enterprise to success, and will be its director.&rdquo; I know
    quite well that he also writes: &ldquo;In principle I accept
    your proposition.&rdquo; But I think it would be going a bit
    too far if we did not firmly point out to him that our proposal
    was meant without all those special considerations, and that we
    ourselves are too short of money to be able to risk anything
    but living together and sharing the monthly money.</label></p>

    <p>And it is true I did not know that he had such a big family;
    because of this he might prefer to stay in the North.</p>

    <p>The utmost one could do would be for me to leave the South
    and go and join him in Brittany, if this would solve his
    difficulties. And my longing to work in the South is naturally
    subordinate to the interests of fellows like him.</p>

    <p>For all that, one should not think lightly of a change.</p>

    <p>Besides, I am a bit afraid of being scolded for having
    separated him from his family, or [for having stirred up] some
    such hornets' nest.</p>

    <p>My God, if he has such a big family, it is probably his duty
    not to absent himself any more. And possibly he would be much
    happier if you simply bought a picture from him once in a
    while.</p>

    <p>If for the present I have neither referred to these two
    passages in his letter nor to certain others, it is because I
    feel it is too difficult to say Yes to them candidly. If on the
    other hand his whole plan is nothing but a fata morgana, which
    consequently will disappear of its own accord, he will speak of
    it again.</p>

    <p>But there are the travelling expenses, the debt at the inn,
    his doctor's bill; now he mentions another debt of 300 francs,
    which he will pay off with that picture, if that art lover he
    knows agrees. But if he doesn't agree&hellip;?</p>

    <p>In short, it would not be very prudent to hold out
    expectations beyond our means, and to enter into greater
    obligations than we could fulfill. Gauguin may say that he is
    very, very agitated, and this is bad enough, and will not do
    his work any good. No, one must not change haphazardly, without
    taking into account those doubts and alterations whose
    existence is not auspicious. The more I calm down here, and the
    more I recover my strength, the more I feel that after all work
    is the only sure thing. I admit that, if life in Brittany is
    considerably cheaper, I should if necessary have to sacrifice
    my plan to work here, and this I shall do with pleasure if it
    is to his advantage. But all the more reason to work hard at
    the fifty pictures that I should like to have finished before
    speaking again about projects of the kind we discussed last
    winter.</p>

    <p>Just now a letter arrived from home. <label content="health.general">At present I am feeling
    so well that it is not indispensable for me to stay here solely
    because of my health.</label> We must try to arrange things in such a
    way that you are not overburdened with expenses; that is what
    is necessary, and it is serious enough.</p>
