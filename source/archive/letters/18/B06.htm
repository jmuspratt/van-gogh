  <body>
    <p>My dear comrade Bernard,</p>

    <p>More and more it seems to me that the pictures which must be
    made so that painting should be wholly itself, and should raise
    itself to a height equivalent to the serene summits which the
    Greek sculptors, the German musicians, the writers of French
    novels reached, are beyond the power of an isolated individual;
    so they will probably be created by groups of men combining to
    execute an idea held in common.</p>

    <p>One may have a superb orchestration of colours and lack
    ideas. Another one is cram-full of new concepts, tragically sad
    or charming, but does not know how to express them in a
    sufficiently sonorous manner because of the timidity of a
    limited palette. All the more reason to regret the lack of
    corporative spirit among the artists, who criticize and
    persecute each other, fortunately without succeeding in
    annihilating each other.</p>

    <p>You will say that this whole line of reasoning is banal - so
    be it! However, the thing itself - the existence of a
    renaissance - this fact is certainly no banality.</p>

    <p>A technical question. Just give me your opinion on it in
    your next letter.<label content="art.technique"> I am going to put the <i>black</i> and the
    <i>white</i><i>,</i> just as the colour merchant sells them to
    us, boldly on my palette and use them just as they are. When -
    and observe that I am speaking of the simplification of colour
    in the Japanese manner - when in a green park with pink paths I
    see a gentleman dressed in black and a justice of the peace by
    trade (the Arab Jew in Daudet's Tartarin calls this honourable
    functionary zouge de paix) who is reading
    L'Intransigeant&hellip;Over him and the park a sky of a simple
    cobalt&hellip; then why not paint the said zouge de paix with
    ordinary bone black and the Intransigeant with simple, quite
    raw white. For the Japanese artist ignores reflected colours,
    and puts the flat tones side by side, with characteristic lines
    marking off the movements and the forms.</label></p>

    <p>[<art id=603_V-B_B060>See illustration of page with sketches.</art>]</p>
    <p><label content="art.theory"> In another category of ideas - when for instance one composes
    a motif of colours representing a yellow sky, then the raw hard
    white of a white wall against the sky may be expressed, if
    necessary, in a strange way by raw white, softened by a neutral
    tone. For the sky itself colours it with a delicate lilac
    hue.</label></p>

    <p>Furthermore, imagine in this so na&iuml;ve landscape, which
    is reasonable, a cottage whitewashed all over (the roof too)
    standing in an orange field - certainly orange, for the Midi
    sky and the blue Mediterranean provoke an orange tint that gets
    more intense just as the scale of blues gets more vigorous
    tones. The black note of the door, the windows and the little
    cross on the ridge of the roof produce a simultaneous contrast
    of black and white just as pleasing to the eye as that of blue
    and orange.</p>

    <p>To take a more amusing motif: let's imagine a woman in a
    black and white checked dress in the same primitive landscape
    with a blue sky and an orange soil - that would be a rather
    funny sight, I imagine. In Arles they often do wear black and
    white checks.</p>

    <p>Suffice it to say that black and white are also colours, for
    in many cases they can be considered as colours, for their
    simultaneous contrast is as striking as that of green and red,
    for example.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">The Japanese make use of it for that matter. They express
    the mat and pale complexion of a young girl and the piquant
    contrast of the black hair marvellously well by means of white
    paper and four strokes of the pen. Not to mention their black
    thornbushes starred all over with a thousand white flowers.</label></p>

    <p>At last I have seen the Mediterranean, which you will
    probably cross sooner than I shall.</p>

    <p>I spent a week at Saintes-Maries, and to get there I drove
    in a diligence across the Camargue with its vineyards, moors
    and flat fields like Holland. There, at Saintes-Maries, were
    girls who reminded one of Cimabue and Giotto - thin, straight,
    somewhat sad and mystic. On the perfectly flat, sandy beach
    little green, red, blue boats, so pretty in shape and colour
    that they made one think of flowers. A single man is their
    whole crew, for these boats hardly venture on the high seas.
    They are off when there is no wind, and make for the shore when
    there is too much of it.</p>

    <p>Gauguin, it seems, is still sick.</p>

    <p>I am very eager to know what you have been working at lately
    - I myself am still doing nothing but landscapes - enclosed a
    sketch. I should also very much like to see Africa, but I
    hardly make any definite plans for the future, it will all
    depend on circumstances.</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">What I should like to find out is the effect of an intenser
    blue in the sky. Fromentin and G&eacute;r&ocirc;me see the soil
    of the South as colourless, and a lot of people see it like
    that. My God, yes, if you take some sand in your hand, if you
    look at it closely, and also water, and also air, they are all
    colourless, looked at in this way. <i>There is no blue without
    yellow and without orange</i>, and if you put in blue,
    then you must put in yellow, and orange too, mustn't you?</label> Oh
    well, you will tell me that what I write to you are only
    banalities.</p>

    <p>A handshake in thought,</p>

    <p><?showImage("");?>
