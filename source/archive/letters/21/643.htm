    <p>[An unfinished letter found among his papers]</p>

    <p>My dear friend Gauguin,</p>

    <p>Thank you for having written to me again, my dear friend, and
    rest assured that since my return I have thought of you every
    day. <label content="psychology.agoraphobia">I stayed in Paris only three days, and the noise, etc., of
    Paris had such a bad effect on me that I thought it wise for my
    head's sake to fly to the country; but for that, I should soon
    have dropped in on you.</label></p>

    <p>And it gives me enormous pleasure when you say the
    <art id=0543>Arl&eacute;sienne's portrait</art>, which was
    based strictly on your drawing, is to your liking. I tried to
    be religiously faithful to your drawing, while nevertheless
    taking the liberty of interpreting through the medium of colour
    the sober character and the style of the drawing in question.
    It is a synthesis of the Arl&eacute;siennes, if you like;
    as syntheses of the Arl&eacute;siennes are rare, take
    this as a work belonging to you and me as a summary of our
    months of work together. For my part I paid for doing it with
    another month of illness, but I also know that it is a canvas
    which will be understood by you, and by a very few others, as
    we would wish it to be understood. My friend Dr. Gachet here
    has taken to it altogether after two or three hesitations, and
    says, &ldquo;How difficult it is to be simple.&rdquo; Very well
    - I want to underline the thing again by etching it, then let
    it be. Anyone who likes can have it.</p>

    <p>Have you also seen the olives? Meanwhile I have <art id=0753>a portrait
    of Dr. Gachet with the heart-broken expression of our time.</art>
    If you like, something like what you said of
    your &ldquo;Christ in the Garden of Olives&rdquo; not meant to
    be understood, but anyhow I follow you there, and my brother
    grasped that nuance absolutely.</p>

    <p>[Here Vincent drew a sketch of <art id=847_V-G_6430>the "Cypress with Star."</art>]</p>

    <p>I still have <art id=0683>a cypress with a star from down there, a last
    attempt - a night sky with a moon without radiance, the slender
    crescent barely emerging from the opaque shadow cast by the
    earth - one star with an exaggerated brilliance, if you like, a
    soft brilliance of pink and green in the ultramarine sky,
    across which some clouds are hurrying. Below, a road bordered
    with tall yellow canes, behind these the blue <i>Basses
    Alpes</i>, an old inn with yellow lighted windows, and a very
    tall cypress, very straight, very sombre.</art></p>

    <p>On the road, a yellow cart with a white horse in harness,
    and two late wayfarers. Very romantic, if you like, but also
    <i>Provence</i>, I think.</p>

    <p>I shall probably etch this and also other landscapes and
    subjects, memories of Provence, then I shall look forward to
    giving you one, a whole summary, rather deliberate and studied.
    My brother says that Lauzet, who does the lithographs after
    Monticelli, liked the head of the Arl&eacute;sienne in
    question.</p>

    <p>But you will understand that having arrived in Paris a
    little confused, I have not yet seen your canvases. But I hope
    to return for a few days soon.</p>

    <p>[Here was drawn <art id=847_V-G_6431>a sketch of "Ears of Wheat."</art>]</p>

    <p>I'm very glad to learn from your letter that you are going
    back to Brittany with De Haan. It is very likely that - if you
    will allow me - I shall go there to join you for a month, to do
    a marine or two, but especially to see you again and make De
    Haan's acquaintance. Then we will try to do something
    purposeful and serious, such as our work would probably have
    become if we had been able to carry on down there.</p>

    <p>Look, here's an idea which may suit you, I am trying to do
    <art id=0767>some studies of wheat like this, but I cannot draw it - nothing
    but ears of wheat with green-blue stalks, long leaves like
    ribbons of green shot with pink, ears that are just turning
    yellow, lightly edged with the pale pink of the dusty bloom - a
    pink bindweed at the bottom twisted round a stem.</art></p>

    <p>After this I would like to paint some portraits against a
    very vivid yet tranquil background. There are the greens of a
    different quality, but of the same value, so as to form a whole
    of green tones, which by its vibration will make you think of
    the gentle rustle of the ears swaying in the breeze: it is not
    at all easy as a colour scheme.</p>
