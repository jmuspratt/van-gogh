  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo, my dear Jo,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter, which I received this morning,
    and for the fifty francs which were in it.</p>

    <p>Today I saw Dr. Gachet again and I am going to paint at his
    house on Tuesday morning, then I shall dine with him and
    afterwards he will come to look at my painting. He seems very
    sensible, but he is as discouraged about his job as a country
    doctor as I am about my painting. Then I said to him that I
    would gladly exchange job for job. Anyway I am ready to believe
    that I shall end up being friends with him. <label content="psychology.depression">He said to me
    besides, that if the depression or anything else became too
    great for me to bear, he could quite well do something to
    diminish its intensity, and that I must not find it awkward to
    be frank with him.</label> Well, the moment when I shall need him may
    certainly come, however up to now all is well. And things may
    yet get better, I still think that it is mostly a malady of the
    South that I have caught, and that the return here will be
    enough to dissipate the whole thing. Often, very often, I think
    of your little one and then I start wishing he was big enough
    to come to the country. For it is the best system to bring them
    up there. How I do wish that you, Jo and the little one would
    take a rest in the country instead of the customary journey to
    Holland.</p>

    <p>Yes, I know quite well that Mother will insist on seeing the
    little one, and that is certainly a reason for going, but she
    would surely understand if it was really better for the
    baby.</p>

    <p>Here one is far enough from Paris for it to be real country,
    but nevertheless how changed since Daubigny. Yet not changed in
    an unpleasant way, there are many villas and various modern
    bourgeois houses, very radiant and sunny and covered with
    flowers.</p>

    <p>This in an almost lush country, just at the moment when a
    new society is developing in the old, is not at all unpleasing;
    there is much well-being in the air. I see or think I see in it
    a quiet like that of Puvis de Chavannes, no factories, but
    lovely greenery in abundance and well kept.</p>

    <p><label content="business.sales">Please tell me sometime, which is the picture that Mlle.
    Bock has bought? I must write to her brother to thank them and
    then I shall suggest exchanging two of my studies for one of
    each of theirs. </label>I have <art id=1624>a drawing of an old vine</art>, from which I
    intend to make a canvas of size 30, and <art id=0752>a
    study of pink chestnuts</art> and <art id=0751>one of white
    chestnuts</art>. But if circumstances allow it, I
    hope to work a little at the figure. Some pictures present
    themselves vaguely to my mind, which it will take time to get
    clear, but that will come bit by bit. If I had not been ill, I
    should have written to Bock and Isa&auml;cson long
    ago.</p>

    <p>My trunk has not yet arrived, which annoys me. I sent a wire
    this morning.</p>

    <p>I thank you in advance for the canvas and paper. Yesterday
    and today it has been wet and stormy, but it is not unpleasant
    to see these effects again. The beds have not arrived either.
    But in spite of these annoyances, I feel happy at not being far
    from you two and my friends any longer. I hope you are well. It
    seemed to me however that you had less appetite than formerly,
    and according to what the doctors say, constitutions like ours
    need very solid nourishment. So be sensible about this,
    especially Jo too, having her child to nurse. Really she ought
    to eat at least double, it would not at all be overdoing it
    when there are children to bring into the world and rear.
    Without that it is like a train going slowly where the line is
    straight. Time enough to reduce steam when the line is more
    uneven.</p>

    <p>A handshake in thought from</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
