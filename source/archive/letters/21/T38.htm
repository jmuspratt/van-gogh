    <p>Letter T38<br>
     Paris, 23 June 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I have something to tell you which I think will give you
    pleasure. In the first place I went to the Salon with De Bock
    yesterday; he came to lunch with us, and then we looked at your
    pictures. He likes them very much, and he gives me the
    impression of understanding them. As you told me that you would
    be glad to exchange a picture with him, when I saw that he
    preferred <art id=0622>the canvas you did after reading the book by Rod</art>, I told
    him he could take that one in exchange
    for a picture of his. He seemed to be enraptured, and put
    everything he had at your disposal. I went with him to see what
    he had at home, and among his pictures there was a size 20
    canvas or thereabouts made at Frameries in the Borinage,
    representing the Crachet and Pecry Works, which you may
    remember; the whole factory looms in a fog of smoke and steam,
    and stands out gloomily against the green wheat, with vivid
    reflections of sunlight on one side. The sky is very luminous.
    Above all I think that the subject and the intention of what he
    wanted to do are remarkable <sup>1</sup>. It is not very
    skillfully done, nor is it vigorous, but it is very truthful,
    like the young fellow himself.</p>

    <p>If you should not like this canvas, he will be pleased to
    exchange it for something else, but I should be surprised if
    you didn't like it at all. The Salon is deplorably wretched,
    there is hardly anything there which is not profoundly boring.
    But let me tell you that you judged rightly in the matter of
    Quost. If I had to choose, I'd take him. They are primroses. It
    is very mild, harmonious, but for all that there is colour in
    it. The Jeannins are good too, but they are blustering.</p>

    <p>I met Quost the other day, and I spoke with him about you. I
    told him that you greatly admire his talent, which pleased him
    very much, he said. If you should come to Paris, you must not
    fail to look him up - he will be very happy when you come to
    see him, either at the garden or at home.</p>

    <p>And now I must tell you something about <art id=1664>your etching</art>.
    It is actually an etching done by a painter.
    There is no refinement of process, but it is a drawing on
    metal. I like that drawing very much - De Bock liked it
    too.</p>

    <p>It's funny that Dr. Gachet has that printing press; the
    others are forever complaining that they have to go to a
    printer to get proofs.</p>

    <p>I think Auvers has a lot of good, and I should like you to
    share this opinion. We are looking forward with a great deal of
    pleasure to going to you. For different reasons: (1) to see
    you, (2) to see your work, (3) on account of the fine scenery,
    and (4) because I hope that seeing the countryside will give me
    the strength to do a lot of work. The Raffaelli exhibition is
    over, now everybody is going to the country, and I shan't lose
    much by not being there.</p>

    <p>Enclosed I send you 50 francs. Last week Jo had to stay in
    bed all the time, but fortunately that is over now. The little
    one is well.</p>

    <p>Kindest regards from Jo and the little one.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
