  <body>
    <p>Dear Sir,</p>

    <p>It's still misery for - may I say it? - us other
    impressionists. I tried the overdoors <sup>1</sup> again at
    Mme. Boivin's, but she says it is her husband and he says it is
    she who does not want them, even after having read your letter,
    he did not want me to hang a painting very high so that he
    might judge the effect. Thus I can do only one thing, which is
    to send you the enclosed 500 francs in advance on the business
    that we will do and <i>we will do a lot, that is said and
    promised</i>, if you will just take good care of yourself and
    care for your eye.</p>

    <p>I have had great difficulties; we almost lost our little
    child. Cow's milk in Paris is poisoned by the dirty food and
    bad treatment of these animals. Donkey's milk has saved him and
    at the moment he is better and even thriving. But you can well
    understand that we must not travel at the present time. It is
    therefore not possible that we offer ourselves the pleasure of
    all three of us coming to visit you. But since on the
    14<sup>th</sup> of this month I must be at Monet's with M.
    Valadon, I am inviting myself, along with my brother-in-law
    <sup>2</sup> and perhaps with my brother Vincent, to come and
    spend that day with you. We will sleep anywhere, so don't worry
    about it. To see the great artist in his home and surroundings
    will give me pleasure.</p>

    <p>When Miss Rogers comes, I shall show her all my [Pissarro]
    paintings. When she came she asked me, referring to Monet,
    &ldquo;If I bought a small painting of his, do you think he
    would give me some lessons?&rdquo; I told her the story about
    the young man going to show him his studies and saying to him,
    &ldquo;Ah, M. Monet, I admire your paintings so much, they all
    have the character of being made from nature.&rdquo; &ldquo;If
    you have seen that, then what is it that you come to do in my
    house?&rdquo; was his reply. She did not dare ask him the same
    thing and she cooled off. She <i>must</i> buy a painting of
    yours and not the least expensive. She ought to be able to
    afford a fine painting at the customary price and she must not
    let us down.</p>

    <p>Best regards from me and my wife, also to Mme. Pissarro.
    When you have something new, let me know.</p>

    <p>Theo van Gogh</p>
