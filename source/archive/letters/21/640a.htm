  <body>
    <p>My dear friends Ginoux,</p>

    <p>I will reply to Mrs. Ginoux's letter without delay, to tell
    you that I am happy to have heard from you; I am very sorry to
    hear that Mr. Ginoux was injured and suffered much pain. I
    urgently request you to let somebody else pack my things, so
    that he need not wear himself out with it; I shall be pleased
    to pay you back all the expenses that you may incur, but I
    insist upon his not exerting himself too much lest the wound
    burst open again. In this way, however, I count on your sending
    the things off on Saturday, for I am anxiously awaiting
    them.</p>

    <p>Yes, I too was very sorry that I could not return to Arles
    to say goodbye to you all, for you know well that I had become
    attached to the people and things of your town with a sincere
    friendship. <label content="health.mental">But lately I had contracted the other patients'
    disease to such an extent that I could not be cured of mine.
    The other patients' society had a bad influence on me, and in
    the end I was absolutely unable to understand it. Then I felt I
    had better try a change, and for that matter, the pleasure of
    seeing my brother, his family and my painter friends again has
    done me a lot of good, and I am feeling completely calm and
    normal. The doctor here says that I ought to throw myself into
    my work with all my strength, and so distract my mind.</label></p>

    <p>This gentleman knows a good deal about painting, and he
    greatly likes mine; he encourages me very much, and two or
    three times a week he comes and visits me for a few hours to
    see what I am doing.</p>

    <p>Twice they have written articles on my pictures. Once in a
    Paris newspaper, and the other time in a newspaper in Brussels,
    where I had an exhibition, and now, a very short time ago,
    there was an article in a paper of my native country, Holland,
    and the consequence was that many people went to look at my
    pictures. And this is not the end. <label content="food-and-drink.alcohol">Besides, it is a certain
    fact that I have done better work than before since I stopped
    drinking, and that is so much gained.</label></p>

    <p>But still I often think of you all, one cannot do what one
    wants in life. The more you feel attached to a spot, the more
    ruthlessly you are compelled to leave it, but the memories
    remain, and one remembers - as in a looking glass, darkly -
    one's absent friends.</p>

    <p>Here is the address:</p>

    <p>Vincent van Gogh,</p>

    <p>chez Ravoux, Place de la Mairie,</p>

    <p>Auvers-sur-Oise,</p>

    <p>(Seine-et-Oise)</p>

    <p>Petite vitesse</p>

    <p>In this way there can be no mistakes. And I thank you in
    advance for your trouble, and mind that Ginoux hires a man to
    do the packing, and does not exert himself; I shall repay your
    expenses.</p>

    <p>Wishing you good health and complete recovery,</p>

    <p>Cordially yours, Vincent van Gogh</p>
