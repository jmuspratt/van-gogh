    <p>[Written at the top of this letter in his mother's
    handwriting was &ldquo;Very last letter from
    Auvers.&rdquo;]</p>

    <p>Dear Mother and sister,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your excellent letters, which gave me a
    great deal of pleasure.<label content="health.symptoms"> For the present I am feeling much
    calmer than last year, and really the restlessness in my head
    has greatly quieted down.</label> In fact, I have always believed that
    seeing the surroundings of the old days would have this
    effect.</p>

    <p>I often think of you both, and should very much like to see
    you once again.</p>

    <p>It is good that Wil went to work in the hospital, and that
    she says that the operations were not as bad as she expected,
    because she appreciates the means of lessening the pain and
    also the efforts of the many physicians to do what has to be
    done, simply and intelligently and kindly - well, that is what
    I call looking at things sensibly - and trustingly.</p>

    <p>But for one's health, as you say, it is very necessary to
    work in the garden and to see the flowers growing.</p>

    <p>I myself am quite absorbed in that <art id=0781>immense plain with wheat
    fields</art> up as far as the hills, boundless as the ocean, delicate
    yellow, delicate soft green, the delicate purple of a tilled
    and weeded piece of ground, with the regular speckle of the
    green of flowering potato plants, everything under a sky of
    delicate tones of blue, white, pink and violet. I am in a mood
    of almost too much calm, just the mood needed for painting
    this.</p>

    <p>I sincerely hope that you will spend very happy days with
    Theo and Jo, and you will see, as I did, how well they take
    care of the little child, who is looking well.</p>

    <p>Anna's children must be quite big now.</p>

    <p>Goodbye for today, I have to go out to work.</p>

    <p>In thought embraced by,</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
