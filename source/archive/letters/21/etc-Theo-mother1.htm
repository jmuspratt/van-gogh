    <p><b>Paris</b>, <b>1 August 1890</b></p>

    <p>[&hellip;]</p>

    <p>One cannot write how sad one is, nor find solace in pouring
    out one's heart. May I come to you soon? I still have to make
    all sorts of arrangements here, but if it is possible, I would
    like to leave here on Sunday morning to be with you in the
    evening. It is a grief that will weigh on me for a long time
    and will certainly not leave my thoughts as long as I live, but
    if one should want to say anything about it, it is that he
    himself has found the rest he so much longed for. If he could
    have seen how people behaved toward me when he had left us and
    the sympathy of so many for himself, he would at this moment
    not have wanted to die.</p>

    <p>Today I received your letter and the one from Wil, and I
    thank you both. I can better tell you everything than write.
    Dr. Gachet and the other doctor were exemplary and have looked
    after him well, but they realized from the first moment that
    there was nothing one could do. Vincent said &ldquo;I would
    like to go like this,&rdquo; and half an hour later he had his
    wish. Life weighed so heavily upon him, but as happens so often
    everyone is now full of praise, also for his talent. Maybe it
    was fortunate that Jo was not here, it would have been such a
    shock for her. May she also come once I am there? Later we will
    go to Amsterdam for a couple of days. Oh, Mother, I so much
    long to be with you. I suppose you will have written to Lies. I
    can't do it at this time. Tomorrow I will only know for certain
    whether I can leave, and if I cannot come, I will let you know.
    Oh, Mother, he was so very much my own brother.</p>
