    <p>Dear Mother,</p>

    <p>I was struck by what you say in your letter about having
    been to Nuenen. You saw everything again, &ldquo;with gratitude
    that once it was yours&rdquo; - and are now able to leave it to
    others with an easy mind. As through a glass, darkly - so it
    has remained; life, the why or wherefore of parting, passing
    away, the permanence of turmoil - one grasps no more of it than
    that.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.loneliness">For me, life may
    well continue in solitude. I have never
    perceived those to whom I have been most attached other than as
    through a glass, darkly.</label></p>

    <p>And yet there is good reason why my work is sometimes more
    harmonious nowadays. Painting is unlike anything else. Last
    year I read somewhere that writing a book or painting a picture
    was like having a child. I don't go so far as to make a claim
    for myself, however - I have always considered the last-named
    the most natural and the best of the three - <i>if</i> indeed
    they are comparable. That is why I at times try my very
    hardest, although it is this very hard work that turns out to
    be the least understood, and though for me it is the only link
    between the past and the present.</p>

    <p>There are a lot of painters in this village - next door a
    whole family of Americans who paint away day in, day out. I
    haven't seen any of their work yet - it's unlikely to be up to
    much.</p>

    <p>Theo, his wife and his child were here last Sunday and we
    lunched at Dr. Gachet's. There my little namesake made his
    acquaintance of the animal world for the first time, as there
    are 8 cats, 3 dogs, as well as chickens, rabbits, ducks,
    pigeons, etc., in large numbers. As yet he doesn't understand
    much of it all, I think. But he looked well, and so did Theo
    and Jo. It is a very reassuring feeling for me to live so much
    closer to them. You too will probably be seeing them soon.</p>

    <p>Once again thanks for your letter, and hoping that you and
    Wil remain in good health, I embrace you in my thoughts,</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
