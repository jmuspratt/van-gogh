    <p>[Written at the top in his mother's handwriting: "Last letter from
    Vincent: 10 days before."</p>

    <p>Dear Mother,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your last letter, which I have not yet
    answered. At the time Wil told me that you have been to Nuenen,
    which I can quite well understand, and I am already longing to
    hear from you how you found things there and of your visits to
    old friends.</p>

    <p>Time passes quickly, though some days last long. And it was
    with great interest that I heard that Wil was working in the
    Walloon hospital. In fact, I did not intend to return to Paris so soon; I should have stayed
    in St. R&eacute;my another year if I had not attributed
    my last attack partly to the influence which the illness of
    others had on me, for which reason I decided it was time to
    change my surroundings if I wanted to keep my energy, such as
    it is, and what I have left of common sense. I wrote this to
    Dr. Peyron today; we had words over it, but we separated on
    good terms, and he has asked Theo for news of me. I liked him
    very much, and in turn he differentiated between me and his
    other patients in my favour.</p>

    <p>And things are such that if I should ever want to go back
    there, I should be there as with friends. But the pleasure of
    seeing Theo again and making the acquaintance of Jo, who seems
    to me sensible and cordial and simple, and my new little
    namesake, and further, to be back among painters and interested
    in all the struggle and discussions and especially in the work
    of the little self-contained world of painters - <label content="health.general">all this
    distraction has, it seems to me, a favourable effect in so far
    as the symptoms of the disease, which are a sort of
    thermometer, have quite disappeared these days - though, as I
    have learned, one must not count too much on this.</label></p>

    <p>The physician here has shown me much sympathy, I may come to
    his house as often as I want, and he has a good knowledge of
    what is being done these days among the painters. He himself is
    very nervous, which I suppose has not improved since his
    wife's death. He has two children, a girl of 19 and a boy
    of 16. He tells me that in my case work is the best thing
    to keep my balance.</p>

    <p>Well, during the last fortnight or three weeks which I spent
    in St. R&eacute;my I worked from morning till night
    without stopping. And I stayed in Paris for only a few days,
    and started working here right away.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">Theo was waiting for me at the station, and my first
    impression was that he was looking paler than when I left. But
    while talking, and when I saw him busy at home, it was not so
    bad - though he was coughing, but in fact he has not grown
    worse during this time. Even if it only stayed the same, I
    should almost believe that this may be considered as something
    gained. And that next year he will grow stronger rather than
    weaker. It is a matter of patience, his constitution and the
    kind of life he has to lead.</label></p>

    <p>I heard some details about Cor from him. When you write,
    please send my best regards, and tell him I am back again. I
    would write him, but it is such a different profession, his and
    mine.</p>

    <p>Theo's vacation is approaching, and so you will see him
    again pretty soon. They also intend to spend a few days here,
    for we saw each other for only a short time and hurriedly.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately it is expensive here in the village, but
    Gachet, the physician, tells me that it is the same in all the
    villages in the vicinity, and that he himself suffers much from
    it compared with before. And for some time to come I shall have
    to stay near a physician I know. And I can pay him in pictures,
    and I could not do that with anyone else if anything happened
    and I needed help.</p>

    <p>Now I say goodbye to you, for I have to go out.
    Hoping you and Wil will receive this in good health, and
    embracing you in thought,</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
