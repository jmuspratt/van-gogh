    <p>Theo to his sister Lies</p>

    <p>5<sup>th</sup> August 1890</p>

    <p>To say we must be grateful that he rests - I still hesitate
    to do so. Maybe I should call it one of the great cruelties of
    life on this earth and maybe we should count him among the
    martyrs who died with a smile on their face.</p>

    <p>He did not wish to stay alive and his mind was so calm
    because he had always fought for his convictions, convictions
    that he had measured against the best and noblest of his
    predecessors. His love for his father, for the gospel, for the
    poor and the unhappy, for the great men of literature and
    painting, is enough proof for that. In the last letter which he
    wrote me and which dates from some four days before his death,
    it says, &ldquo;I try to do as well as certain painters whom I
    have greatly loved and admired.&rdquo; People should realize
    that he was a great artist, something which often coincides
    with being a great human being. In the course of time this will
    surely be acknowledged, and many will regret his early death.
    He himself wanted to die, when I sat at his bedside and said
    that we would try to get him better and that we hoped that he
    would then be spared this kind of despair, he said, &ldquo;La
    tristesse durera toujours&rdquo; [The sadness will last
    forever]. I understood what he wanted to say with those
    words.</p>

    <p>A few moments later he felt suffocated and within one minute
    he closed his eyes. A great rest came over him from which he
    did not come to life again.</p>
