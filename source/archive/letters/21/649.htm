  <body>
    <p>Dear brother and sister,</p>

    <p>The letter from Jo has really been like a gospel for me,<label content="feelings.apprehension"> a
    deliverance from the distress caused by the hours I shared with
    you, which were a bit difficult and trying for us all. [Earlier
    in the month Vincent had gone on his last visit to Paris.] It
    is no slight matter when we are all made aware that our daily
    bread is at risk, no slight matter when for different reasons
    we are also made aware of the precariousness of our
    existence.</label></p>

    <p>Back here, I, too, still felt very sad, and the storm which
    threatens you continued to weigh heavily on me as well. What is
    to be done? Look here, I try to be fairly good-humoured in
    general, but my life too is threatened at its very root, and my
    step is unsteady too.</p>

    <p>I was afraid - not entirely - but nevertheless a little -
    that my being a burden on you was something you found
    intolerable - but Jo's letter proves to me clearly that you do
    realize that I am working and making an effort just as much as
    you are.</p>

    <p>So - having arrived back here, I have set to work again -
    although the brush is almost falling from my fingers - and
    because I knew exactly what I wanted to do, I have painted
    three more large canvases. <art id=0781>They are vast stretches</art> of <art id=0761>corn
    under troubled skies</art>, and I did not have to go out of my way
    very much in order to try to express sadness and extreme
    loneliness. I hope you will be seeing them soon since I'd like
    to bring them to you in Paris as soon as possible. I'm fairly
    sure that these canvases will tell you what I cannot say in
    words, that is, how healthy and invigorating I find the
    countryside.</p>

    <p>The third canvas is <art id=0776>Daubigny's garden</art>, a picture I have had
    in mind ever since I came here.</p>

    <p>I hope with all my heart that the proposed journey will help
    a little to take your mind off things.</p>

    <p>I often think of the little one, I don't doubt it's better
    to bring up children than to spend all one's nervous energy on
    making pictures, but it can't be helped, I am, or at least I
    feel I am, too old now to retrace my steps or to desire
    anything different. That desire has left me, though the mental
    suffering remains.</p>

    <p>I was very sorry not to have seen Guillaumin again, but I am
    pleased that he has seen my canvases. If I had waited for him,
    I should probably have stayed talking to him so long I would
    have missed my train.</p>

    <p>Wishing you both luck, a stout heart and comparative
    prosperity, may I ask you to tell Mother and our sister once
    again that I think of them very often. Indeed, I had a letter
    from them this morning and will be replying soon.</p>

    <p>Handshakes in thought,</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>My money will not last me very long this time, for on my
    return I had to pay the bill for the luggage from Arles. I have
    some very pleasant memories of that journey to Paris. A few
    months ago I hardly dared to hope to see my friends again. I
    think that Dutch lady [the sculptress Saar de Swart] is most
    talented. Lautrec's picture,<art id=autrec> Portrait de musicienne,</art> is quite
    wonderful, it moved me when I saw it.</p>
