    <p>Letter T 37<br>
     Paris, 15 June 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I am very pleased to see that the news about yourself goes
    on being good, and that the courage to do your work is far from
    leaving you.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">Today Tasset is going to send you the paints you ordered.
    The other day Tangui told me that Tasset's tubes were much
    shorter and therefore contained less paint than his. If this
    should be the case, please tell me, for then I could make use
    of it to get a reduction in price.</label> It will be much easier for
    you when your furniture has arrived, for then you might be able
    to get a comrade to stay with you too. There is a Dutchman who
    is going to call on you; he was recommended by De Bock
    <sup>1</sup>, who had advised him to go to Fontainebleau, but
    he doesn't like it. I don't know if he has any talent; he had
    nothing to show me.</p>

    <p>Lauzet came yesterday morning to see your pictures; he is
    very busy with his Monticellis, which are to appear within some
    ten days. He likes the<art id=0489> &ldquo;Portrait of a Woman&rdquo;</art> which you
    did at Arles very much. As regards his
    [Gauguin's] project with reference to Martinique, perhaps it is
    what he needs, but if it depends wholly on a payment to be made
    to an inventory, it is not very certain yet. Herewith enclosed
    you will find a letter from him, which he asked me to send on
    to you. Staying with Schuffenecker doesn't do him any good; he
    is hardly doing any work, whereas Brittany inspires him. So it
    is right that he should go away.</p>

    <p>I give you Jo's greetings; I must hurry to finish this
    letter, otherwise it will not go off today. She is a little
    indisposed, but I hope it is nothing serious.</p>

    <p>Cordial handshake.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>
