  <body>
    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter of today and the 50-fr. note it
    contained.</p>

    <p>I would like to try, perhaps, to write to you about a lot of
    things, but the inclination has passed, and then I feel the pointlessness of it all.</p>

    <p>I hope that you found these worthy gentlemen favourably
    disposed toward you.</p>

    <p>As far as the peace of your household is concerned, I am as
    much convinced that it can be preserved as I am that it is
    threatened by storms.</p>

    <p>I would rather not forget the little French I know, and am
    certainly unable to see the sense in delving deeper into the
    rights or wrongs of one side or the other in any discussion. It
    wouldn't be my concern anyway.</p>

    <p>Things move quickly here. Aren't Dries, you and I rather
    more convinced of that, don't we understand that rather better
    than those ladies? So much the better for them - but in the
    long run we can't even count on talking coolly about it.</p>

    <p>As far as I'm concerned, I am giving my canvases my
    undivided attention. I am trying to do as well as certain
    painters whom I have greatly loved and admired.</p>

    <p>Now I have returned, my feeling is that the painters
    themselves are fighting more and more with their backs to the
    wall.</p>

    <p>Very well&hellip;but hasn't the moment for trying to make
    them understand the usefulness of an association already
    passed? On the other hand an association, should it come about,
    would go under if the rest were to go under. In that case, you
    might say, the dealers could throw their lot in with the
    impressionists - but that would be very short-lived.
    Altogether, it seems to me that personal initiative is of no
    avail, and given the experience we've had, should we really be
    starting all over again?</p>

    <p>I noted with pleasure that the Gauguin from Brittany I saw
    is very beautiful, and it seems to me that the others he has
    done will probably be so as well.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you will take a look at this sketch of Daubigny's
    garden - it is <art id=0776>one of my most carefully thought-out canvases</art>. I
    am adding a sketch of <art id=0780>some old thatched roofs</art> and the sketches
    of <art id=0781>two size 30 canvases</art> representing <art id=0782>vast fields of wheat after
    the rain</art>. <label content="art.supplies">Hirschig has asked if you to be kind enough to order
    for him the list of paints enclosed from the same dealer where
    you buy my paints.</p>

    <p>Tasset could send them to him direct, cash on delivery, but
    then he would have to give him the 20 per cent discount. Whatever
    would be the simplest. Or else you could put them in with the
    package of paints for me, adding the bill, or telling me how
    much the total amount comes to, and then he would send the
    money to you. You cannot get anything good in the way of paints
    here. I have cut my own order to the barest minimum.</label></p>

     Hirschig is beginning to get a better idea of things, it seems
    to me. He has done a portrait of the old schoolmaster, which he has
    given to him, good - and then he has some
    landscape studies which are almost the same colour as the
    Konings at your place. They may turn out to be quite like
    these, or like the things by Voerman which we saw together.</p>

    <p>Goodbye for now, keep well and good luck in business, etc.,
    remember me to Jo and handshakes in thought.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
