  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter of the day before yesterday and
    for the 50-fr. note it contained. <label content="art.materials">I have been waiting for the
    package of paints and canvas from Tasset - which has just
    arrived and for which also I thank you very much - before
    answering your questions as to the difference between Tanguy's
    and Tasset's colours. Well, it all comes to the same thing,
    among Tasset's tubes there are now and then some, especially
    those containing white, which are badly filled. But when Tanguy
    in his turn fills them badly too - certainly without doing it
    on purpose - e. g. the tubes of cobalt, </label>I am holding one just
    now - so, considering that the facts of the case are the same
    on both sides, I do not see why they should have anything very
    serious to reproach each other with.</p>

    <p>If there were any difference in the composition, that's what
    would interest me more. And in paint there is adulteration just
    as there is in wines, and how can you judge accurately, when
    you, like me, do not know chemistry? Nevertheless, as old
    Tanguy is taking the trouble to send off the canvases which are
    in his attic for us, I should strongly approve of your getting
    paints from him, even if they were a bit worse than the others.
    That would only be fair. But I repeat, what he says about a
    difference in the tubes is pure imagination on his part, and
    the reason people go to Tasset is because the latter's paints
    are generally less insipid.</p>

    <p>But the difference is not important, and if Tanguy is ready
    and willing to pack the canvases deposited with him, it's fair
    that he should have the order for the paints.</p>

    <p>I was pleased to make the acquaintance of the Dutchman
    <sup>1</sup> who came yesterday; he looks much too nice to
    paint under the present conditions. If, however, he persists in
    wanting to do it, I told him he would do well to go to Brittany
    and stay with Gauguin and De Haan <sup>2</sup>, because there
    he could live for 3 francs a day instead of 5 francs and would
    have pleasant company - and that I hope very much to join them,
    since Gauguin is going there. I am very glad to hear that they
    are going to renew their attempt there.</p>

    <p>You are certainly right that it is better for Gauguin than
    staying in Paris. Very glad too that he thinks well of the head
    of <art id=0543>the Arl&eacute;sienne </art>in question. I hope he does some
    etchings of southern subjects, say six, since I can print them
    without cost at M. Gachet's, who is kind enough to print them
    for nothing if I do them. That is certainly something that
    ought to be done, and we will do it in such a way that it will
    form a sort of sequel to the Lauzet-Monticelli publication, if
    you approve. And Gauguin will probably engrave some of his
    canvases in conjunction with me. His picture that you have, for
    instance, and for the rest, the Martinique things especially.
    M. Gachet will print these plates for us too. Of course he will
    be at liberty to print copies for himself. M. Gachet is coming
    to see my canvases in Paris someday and then we could choose
    some of them for engraving.</p>

    <p>At the moment I am working on two studies, <art id=0763>one a bunch of
    wild plants</art>, thistles, ears of wheat, and sprays of different
    kinds of leaves - the one almost red, the other bright green,
    the third turning yellow.</p>

    <p>The second study, <art id=0766>a white house </art>in the verdure with a star
    in the night sky and an orange-coloured light in the window and
    black verdure and a note of sombre pink. That
    is all for the moment. I am planning to make a more important
    canvas of Daubigny's house and garden, of which I already have
    <art id=0765>a little study</art>.</p>

    <p>I am very glad that Gauguin is going away with De Haan
    again. Naturally I thought the Madagascar project almost
    impossible to put into practice, I would rather see him leaving
    for Tonkin. If he went to Madagascar, however, I should be
    capable of following him there, for you must go there in twos
    or threes. But we aren't that far yet. Certainly the future of
    painting is in the tropics, either in Java or Martinique,
    Brazil or Australia, and not here, but you know that I am not
    convinced that you, Gauguin or I are the men of that future.
    But I repeat, no doubt probably someday in the near future
    impressionists who will hold their own with Millet and Pissarro
    will be at work there and not here. It is natural to believe
    this, but to go there without means of existence or relations
    with Paris is madness, when for years you have been getting
    rusty vegetating here.</p>

    <p>Thank you once more, and a good handshake for you and your
    wife, and good health to the little one, whom I am longing to
    see again.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

        <p>From September, 1889, through at least December, De Haan
        was to be Gauguin's sole financial support: &ldquo;If I
        hadn't helped him with the necessaries these last three
        months, and paid for everything, he would literally have
        starved, for he hasn't had a penny since September.&rdquo;
