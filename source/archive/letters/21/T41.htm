    <p>Letter T41 <sup>1</sup><br>
     Paris, 14 July 1890</p>

    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>We are very happy that you are not as much under the impression
    of the unsettled business questions as you were when
    you were here. Indeed, the danger is really not as serious as you
    believed. If only we can continue in good health, which will
    allow us to undertake what is growing little by little into a
    necessity in our minds, all will go well. Disappointments? -
    certainly, but we are no beginners, and we are like wagoners
    who by all the efforts of their horses <i>almost</i> reach
    the top of the hill, do an about-turn, and then, often with one
    more push, manage to gain the summit. If only we could always keep
    this in mind.</p>

    <p>Today we are finishing the packing of our trunks to
    leave for Leyden tomorrow morning <sup>2</sup>. From there I
    shall go to Mesdag on Wednesday to speak with him about Corot,
    and then to Antwerp with a picture by Diaz. Although the
    eight days are past now, those gentlemen have not said a word
    about what they intend to do with me.</p>

    <p>Dries, on the contrary, has shown himself to be very cowardly and
    really under his wife's domination. He freely confessed that everything
    I had offered him was in order to attract him to the apartment below us,
    so that we could have his wife as some sort of maid. I do not believe that this
    came from him. However, I didn't think that his wife was as crazy as that. This is
    the second time that he has withdrawn at a decisive moment, and yet you were
    here when we spoke about it and he answered me that I could definitely count on him.
    I really don't understand him at all, and blame his hesitancy on his wife. That is his problem.</p>

    <p>Enclosed you are receiving 50 francs. If I should have the
    good fortune to do business during my trip, it would make
    things still easier for me. Goodbye, old fellow; I shall
    probably be back after eight days.</p>

    <p>Kindest regards from Jo, and believe me your loving
    brother.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>
