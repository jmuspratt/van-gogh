    <p>W21 <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Auvers, c. 4 June 1890</p>

    <p>My Dear Sister,</p>

    <p>For many days now I have wanted to reply to
    your kind letter which I received while still at
    St. R&eacute;my. <label content="health.general">It
    didn't go too well there, and I became rather worse
    because of the treatment. </label>In Paris it was a great joy
    for me to see Theo again, and to make the acquaintance of Jo
    and the little one. Jo made an excellent impression of me; she
    is charming and very simple and brave. Yes, it seems to me that
    things are going as well as possible for the moment.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.agoraphobia">And as for myself, at the moment
    I am still afraid of the noise and the bustle of Paris, and I immediately went off into
    the country - to an old village.</label></p>

    <p>Here there are mossy thatched roofs which are superb, and which I am certainly going
    to do something with.</p>

    <p>Moreover, I think that the doctor I am
    recommended to will just leave me to my own devices, as if
    there were nothing wrong with me.</p>

    <p>During the final days at St. R&eacute;my  I still worked
    in a frenzy, great bouquets of flowers, <art id=0678>violet irises</art>, big
    <art id=0682>bouquets</art> of <art id=0681>roses</art>, landscapes.</p>

    <p>It was funny to see all my canvases again from when I
    started, those which I left there.</p>

    <p>But I should very much have liked you to see the olive
    orchards that I have brought back with me now, with their
    skies of yellow, pink and blue, different enough. I think that these
    are canvases that have never been painted in quite this manner up until now.
    Up to the present the others have always painted
    them in grey.</p>

    <p>I was immensely pleased to see the exhibition at the Champ
    de Mars, where there were a lot of things that I liked very
    much.</p>

    <p>[The letter stops abruptly on the third page, which just
    contains the final sentence. It was obviously a rough draught for
    letter W 22, which contains all of the ideas above.]</p>
