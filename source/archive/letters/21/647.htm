    <p>Auvers-sur-Oise, 7 July 1890</p>

    <p>Dear brother and sister,</p>

    <p>My impression is that since we are all rather confused and
    also that a little overwrought, it matters comparatively little
    to insist on having very clear definitions of the position
    we find ourselves in. You rather surprise me by seeming to want to
    force the situation and are in discord. Can I do anything about it - perhaps not -
    but have I done something wrong, or is there anything you would like me to do?</p>

    <p>However that may be, once again, a good handshake,
    and in spite of everything it gave me a great deal of
    pleasure to see you all again.</p>

    <p>Be very sure of that.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
