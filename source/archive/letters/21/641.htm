  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>At last I have heard news of my furniture, the man with whom
    it is has been ill all the time, having been gored by a bull
    when he was helping to unload them. So his wife wrote me that
    this was the reason why they put it off from one day to
    another, but that on Saturday, that is today, they will send
    it. They have had no luck, the wife has been ill too and is not
    yet completely recovered, but there wasn't a word of reproach
    in the letter, except that it had pained them that I did not
    come to see them before leaving; that pained me too.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">Enclosed I must send you an order for some paints</label>. I have
    another study in the style of <art id=0412>the &ldquo;Harvest,&rdquo; which is in your
    room where the piano is</art>. <art id=0760>Some fields seen from a height, with a road
    and a little carriage on it</art>; now I am working on <art id=0636>a field of poppies in
    alfalfa</art>.</p>

    <p>I have <art id=0762>a vineyard study</art>, which M. Gachet liked very much the
    last time he came to see me.</p>

    <p>For the moment I have nothing else to tell you; a letter
    came from Mother, she had been at Nuenen and was longing for
    your arrival and to see the little one. A good handshake for
    you both.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
