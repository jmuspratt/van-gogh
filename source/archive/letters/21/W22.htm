    <p>W22 <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Auvers-sur-Oise, 5 June 1890</p>

    <p>My Dear Sister,</p>

    <p>I ought to have replied to the two letters I received when I
    was still at St. R&eacute;my, but the journey, the work
    and a lot of new emotions caused me to postpone from day to day
    until this moment writing you a letter. I was greatly
    interested to hear that you nursed the patients at Walloon
    Hospital. It is certainly in this way that one learns a lot of
    the best and most necessary things one can ever learn, and I
    for one am very sorry that I know nothing, or next to nothing,
    about this.</p>

    <p>It was a great happiness to me to see Theo again, and to
    make the acquaintance of Jo and the little one.<label content="Theo.health"> Theo's cough
    was worse than it was when I left him two years ago, but when I
    talked with him and saw him at close range it seemed certain to
    me that, all things considered, there is a change rather for
    the better,</label> and Jo is full of good sense, as well as good
    intentions.</p>

    <p>The little one is not weakly but on the other hand he is not
    strong either. It is a good system that, when you are living in
    a big city, the wife goes into the country for her confinement,
    and stays there with her baby for some months. You know what it
    is, the first confinement in particular is a very serious
    thing, and they never could have acted better or otherwise than
    they did. I hope that before long they will come to Auvers for
    a few days.</p>

    <p>As for myself, the travelling and all the rest have come off
    very well so far, and coming back north has been a great
    distraction for me. And then I have found a true friend in Dr.
    Gachet, something like another brother, so much do we resemble
    each other physically and also mentally. He is a very nervous
    man himself and very queer in his behaviour; he has extended
    much friendliness to the artists of the new school, and he has
    helped them as much as was in his power. I painted his portrait
    the other day, and I am also going to paint a portrait of his
    daughter, who is nineteen years old. He lost his wife some
    years ago, which greatly contributed to his becoming a broken
    man. I believe I may say we have been friends from the very
    first, and every week I shall go stay at his house one or two
    days in order to work in his garden, where I have already
    painted two studies, <art id=0755>one with southern plants, aloes,
    cypresses, marigolds</art>; the other <art id=0756>with white
    roses, some vines and a figure, and a cluster of ranunculuses
    besides</art>. Apart from these I have <art id=0789>a larger
    picture of the village church</art> - an effect in which the building
    appears to be violet-hued against a sky of simple deep blue
    colour, pure cobalt; the stained-glass windows appear as
    ultramarine blotches, the roof is violet and partly orange. In
    the foreground some green plants in bloom, and sand with the
    pink flow of sunshine in it. And once again it
    is nearly the same thing as the studies I did in Nuenen of <art id=0084>the
    old tower and the cemetery</art>, only it is probably that now the
    colour is more expressive, more sumptuous.</p>

    <p>But during the last weeks at St. R&eacute;my I worked
    like a man in a frenzy, especially on <art id=0682>bunches of flowers</art>, <art id=0681>roses</art>
    and <art id=0678>violet</art> <art id=0680>irises</art>. I brought along a relatively large picture
    for Theo's and Jo's little boy - which they hung over the piano
    - <art id=0671>white almond blossoms</art> - big branches against a sky-blue
    background - and they also have a new portrait
    of <art id=0543>the Arl&eacute;sienne</art> in their apartment.</p>

    <p>My friend Dr. Gachet is <i>decidedly enthusiastic</i> about
    the latter portrait of an Arl&eacute;sienne, which I
    also have a copy of for myself<art id=0540></art> - and also about a
    <art id=0627>self-portrait</art>, which I am very glad of, seeing
    that he will urge me to paint figures, and I hope he is going
    to find some interesting models for me to paint.</p>

    <p>What impassions me most - much, much more than all the rest
    of my m&eacute;tier - is the portrait, the modern
    portrait. I seek it in colour, and surely I am not the only one
    to seek it in this direction. I <i>should like</i> - mind you,
    far be it from me to say that I shall be able to do it,
    although this is what I am aiming at - I <i>should like</i> to
    paint portraits which would appear after a century to people
    living then as apparitions. By which I mean that I do not
    endeavour to achieve this by a photographic resemblance, but by
    means of our impassioned expressions - that is to say, using
    our knowledge of and our modern taste for colour as a means of
    arriving at the expression and the intensification of the
    character. So the <art id=0753>portrait of Dr. Gachet</art> shows you a face the
    colour of an overheated brick, and scorched by the sun, with
    reddish hair and a white cap, surrounded by a rustic scenery
    with a background of blue hills; his clothes are ultramarine -
    this brings out the face and makes it paler, notwithstanding
    the fact that it is brick-coloured. His hands, the hands of an
    obstetrician, are paler than the face. Before him, lying on a
    red garden table, are yellow novels and a foxglove flower of a
    somber purple hue.</p>

    <p>My self-portrait is done in nearly the same way but the blue
    is the fine blue of the Midi, and the clothes are a light
    lilac. The portrait of the Arl&eacute;sienne has a drab
    and lusterless flesh colour, the eyes calm and very simple, a
    black dress, the background pink, and with her elbow she is
    leaning on a green table with green books.</p>

    <p>But in the copy which is in Theo's possession the dress is
    pink, the background yellowish white, and the front of the open
    bodice is of muslin of a white colour emerging into green.
    Among all these colours only the hair, the eyebrows, and the
    eyes form black spots.</p>

    <p><art id=SkW22>I do not succeed in making a good sketch of it</art>.</p>

    <p>There is a superb picture by Puvis de Chavannes at the
    exhibition. The figures of the persons are dressed in bright
    colours, and one cannot tell whether they are costumes of today
    or on the other hand clothes of antiquity.</p>

    <p>On one side two women, dressed in simple long robes, are
    talking together, and one the other side men with the air of
    artists; in the middle of the picture a woman with her child on
    her arm is picking a flower off an apple tree in bloom. One
    figure is forget-me-not blue, another bright citron yellow,
    another of a delicate pink colour, another white, another
    violet. Underneath their feet a meadow dotted with little white
    and yellow flowers. A blue distance with a white town and a
    river. All humanity, all nature simplified, but as they
    <i>might</i> be if they are not like that.</p>

    <p>This description does not tell you anything - but when one
    sees this picture, when one looks at it for a long time, one
    gets the feeling of being present at a rebirth, total but
    benevolent, of all things one should have believed in, should
    have wished for - a strange and happy meeting of very distant
    antiquities and crude modernity.</p>

    <p>I was very much pleased to see Andr&eacute; Bonger
    again too; he was looking strong and calm, and, upon my word,
    reasoned with much correctness on artistic subjects.</p>

    <p>I was extremely glad that he was in Paris during the time I
    was there.</p>

    <p>Once more thanks for your letters. I hope to see you soon, I
    embrace you in thought.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
