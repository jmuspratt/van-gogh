  <body>
    <p>Dear Mr. Isa&auml;cson,</p>

    <p>Back in Paris I read the continuation of your articles on
    impressionism.</p>

    <p>Without wanting to enter into a discussion of the details of
    the subject that you have attacked, I wish to inform you that
    it seems to me that you are conscientiously trying to tell our
    fellow countrymen how things are, basing yourself on facts. As
    it is possible that in your next article you will put a few
    words about me, I will repeat my scruples, so that you will not
    go beyond a <i>few</i> words, because it is <i>absolutely
    certain</i> that I shall never do important things.</p>

    <p>And this, although I believe in the possibility that a later
    generation will be, and will go on being, concerned with the
    interesting research on the subject of colours and modern
    sentiment along the same lines as, and of equal value to, those
    of Delacroix, of Puvis de Chavannes and that impressionism will
    be their source, if you like, and future Dutchmen will likewise
    be engaged in the struggle - all this is within the realm of
    possibility and certainly your articles have their raison
    d'&eacute;tre.</p>

    <p>But I was straying into vaguenesses: so here is the reason
    for this letter - I wanted to let you know that in the South I
    have been trying to paint some olive groves. You surely know
    the existing pictures of olive trees. It seems probable to me
    that there are such in Monet's and Renoir's work. But apart
    from this, I have not seen anything of the work I suppose to
    exist - apart from this, not much has been made of olive
    trees.</p>

    <p>Well, probably the day is not far off when they will paint
    olive trees in all kinds of ways, just as they paint the Dutch
    willows and pollard willows, just as they have painted the
    Norman apple tree ever since Daubigny and Cesar de Cock. The
    effect of daylight, of the sky, makes it possible to extract an
    infinity of subjects from the olive tree. Now, I on my part
    sought contrasting effects in the foliage, changing with the
    hues of the sky. At times the whole is a pure all-pervading
    blue, namely when the tree bears its pale flowers, and big blue
    flies, emerald rose beetles and cicadas in great numbers are
    hovering around it. Then, as the bronzed leaves are getting
    riper in tone, the sky is brilliant and radiant with green and
    orange, or, more often even, in autumn, when the leaves acquire
    something of the violet tinges of the ripe fig, the violet
    effect will manifest itself vividly through the contrasts, with
    the large sun taking on a white tint within a halo of clear and
    pale citron yellow. At times, after a shower, I have also seen
    the whole sky coloured pink and bright orange, which gave an
    exquisite value and colouring to the silvery grey-green. And in
    the midst of that there were women, likewise pink, gathering
    fruits.</p>

    <p>These canvases, together with a number of flower studies,
    are all that I have done since our last correspondence. These
    flowers are <art id=0681>an avalanche of roses against a green background</art>,
    and <art id=0678>a very big bouquet of irises, violet against
    a yellow background</art>, <art id=0680>against a pink background</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">I begin to feel more and more that one may look upon Puvis
    de Chavannes as having the same importance as Delacroix, at
    least that he is on a par with the fellows whose style
    constitutes a &ldquo;hitherto, but no further,&rdquo;
    comforting for evermore.</label></p>

    <p>Among other pictures his canvas, now at the Champ de Mars,
    seems to contain an allusion to an equivalence, a strange and
    providential meeting of <i>very</i> far-off antiquities and
    <i>crude</i> modernity. His canvases of the last few years are
    vaguer, more prophetic if possible than even Delacroix, before
    them one feels an emotion as if one were present at the
    continuation of all kinds of things, a benevolent renaissance
    ordained by fate. But it is better not to pursue the subject
    when one is standing gratefully enthralled before a finished
    painting like the &ldquo;Sermon on the Mount.&rdquo; Ah, he
    would know how to do the olive trees of the South, he <i>the
    seer</i>. As for me, I tell you as a friend, I feel
    impotent when confronted with such nature, for my Northern
    brains were oppressed by a nightmare in those peaceful spots,
    as I felt that one ought to do better things with the foliage.
    Yet I did not want to leave things alone <i>entirely</i>,
    without making an effort, but it is restricted to the
    expression of two things - the cypresses - the olive trees -
    let others who are better and more powerful than I reveal their
    symbolic language. Millet is the voice of the wheat, and Jules
    Breton too. Therefore I assure you that I cannot think of Puvis
    de Chavannes without having a presentiment that one day he or
    someone else will explain the olive trees to us. For myself I
    can see from afar the possibility of a new art of painting, but
    it was too much for me, and it is with pleasure that I return
    to the North.</p>

    <p>Look here, there is another question that comes to mind. Who
    are the human beings that actually live among the olive, the
    orange, the lemon orchards?</p>

    <p>The peasant there is different from the inhabitant of
    Millet's wide wheat fields. But Millet has reawakened our
    thoughts so that we can see the dweller in nature. But until
    now no one has painted the real Southern Frenchman for us. But
    when Chavannes or someone else shows us that human being, we
    shall be reminded of those words, ancient but with a blissfully
    new significance, Blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are
    the pure of heart, words that have such a wide purport that we,
    educated in the old, confused and battered cities of the North,
    are compelled to stop at a great distance from the threshold of
    those dwellings. And however deeply convinced we may be of
    Rembrandt's vision, yet we must ask ourselves:</p>

    <p>And did Raphael have this in mind, and Michelangelo, and da
    Vinci? This I do not know, but I believe that Giotto, who was
    less of a heathen, felt it more deeply - that great sufferer,
    who remains as familiar to us as a contemporary.</p>

    <p>[The end is missing.]</p>
