  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo and dear Jo,</p>

    <p>I have just received the letter in which you say that the
    child is ill; I should greatly like to come and see you, and
    what holds me back is the thought that I should be even more
    powerless than you in the present state of anxiety. But I feel
    how dreadful it must be and I wish I could help you.</p>

    <p>I am afraid of increasing the confusion by coming
    immediately. But I share your anxiety with all my heart. It is
    a great pity that M. Gachet's house is so encumbered with all
    sorts of things. But for that, I think that it would be a good
    plan to come and stay here - with him - with the little one,
    for a full month at least. I think that country air has an
    enormous effect. In this very street there are youngsters who
    were born in Paris and were really sickly - who, however, are
    doing well now. It would also be possible to come to the inn,
    it's true. So that you should not be too much alone, I should
    come to you myself for a week or fortnight. That would not
    increase the expenses.</p>

    <p>As for the little one, really, I am beginning to fear that
    it will be necessary to give him fresh air and, even more, the
    little bustle of other children that a village has. I think Jo,
    too, who shares our anxieties and risks, ought to have a change
    of air in the country from time to time.</p>

    <p>Rather a gloomy letter from Gauguin, he talks vaguely of
    definitely having decided on Madagascar, but so vaguely that
    you can see that he is only thinking of this because he really
    does not know what else to think of.</p>

    <p>And carrying out the plan seems almost absurd to me.</p>

    <p>Here are three sketches - one of a peasant woman, big yellow
    hat with a knot of sky-blue ribbons, very red face, rich blue
    blouse with orange spots, background of ears of wheat.</p>

    <p>It is <art id=0774>a size 30 canvas</art>, but I'm afraid it's really a bit
    coarse. Then the horizontal landscape with
    fields, like one of Michel's, but then <art id=0775>the colour is
    soft green, yellow and green-blue</art>.</p>

    <p>Then the undergrowth around poplars, <art id=0773>violet trunks
    running across the landscape</art>, perpendicular like columns; the
    depths of the wood are blue and at the bottom of the big
    trunks, the grassy ground full of flowers, white, pink, yellow
    and green, long grass turning russet, and flowers.</p>

    <p>The people at the inn here used to live in Paris, where they
    were constantly unwell, parents and children; here they never
    have anything wrong with them at all, especially the youngest
    one, who came when he was two months old, and then the mother
    had difficulty nursing him, whereas here everything came right
    almost at once. On the other hand, you work all day, and at
    present you probably hardly sleep. I honestly believe that Jo
    would have twice as much milk here, and that when she comes
    here, you will be able to do without cows, donkeys and other
    quadrupeds. And as for Jo - so that she should have some
    company in the daytime - well, she could stay right opposite
    old Gachet's house, perhaps you remember that there is an inn
    just across the way at the bottom of the hill?</p>

    <p>What can I say about a future perhaps, perhaps, without the
    Boussods? <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>That will be as it may, you have not spared yourself trouble
    for them, you have served them with exemplary loyalty at all
    times.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I myself am also trying to do as well as I can, but I will
    not conceal from you that I hardly dare count on always being
    in good health. And if my disease returns, you would forgive
    me. </label>I still love art and life very much, but as for ever having
    a wife of my own, I have no great faith in that. I rather fear
    that toward say forty - or rather say nothing - I declare I
    know nothing, absolutely nothing as to what turn this may take.
    But I am writing to you at once because I think that you must
    not be unreasonably worried about the little one; if it's just
    that he's cutting teeth, well, to make the job easier for him,
    it would perhaps be possible to distract him with more here
    where there are children, and animals, and flowers, and fresh
    air. I shake your hand and Jo's in thought and a kiss for the
    little one.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>An Englishman, an Australian, named Walpole Brooke, will
    probably come to see you, he lives at 16 Rue de la Grande
    Chaumi&egrave;re - I told him that you would let him know
    when he could come to see the canvases that are at your
    place.</p>

    <p>He will probably show you some of his studies, which are
    still rather smeary, but all the same he does observe nature.
    He has been here at Auvers for some months and we've sometimes
    gone out together. He was brought up in Japan, you would not
    know it to look at his painting - but that may come.</p>

    <p>Thanks for the package of paints, for the 50-fr. note, and
    the article on the Independents.</p>

        <p>See letter T39; Theo had written that the child was ill;
        he also spoke of a plan to give up his job and set out on
        his own. So much was needed, and under the circumstances
        Vincent as well as Theo had to economize. Theo also wished
        in his letter that Vincent too might find a wife someday to
        share his life with him. A few days later Vincent himself
        came to see Theo and Jo in Paris.</p>
