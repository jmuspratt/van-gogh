    <p>Letter T36<br>
     Paris, 5 June 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I cannot tell you how happy we are because you could write
    us that you continue in good health, and that your stay at
    Auvers has had rather a good influence on your condition. Dr.
    Gachet came to see me yesterday, but unfortunately there were
    customers, which prevented me from talking with him very much,
    but at any rate he told me that he thought you entirely
    recovered, and that he did not see any reason for a return of
    your malady. He invited us to visit him next Sunday, when you
    will also be there.</p>

    <p>We should be damned glad to do it, but it is not possible
    all the same for Jo to make a definite promise. On Whitsunday
    we went to St. Cloud, where we had that terrible cloudburst,
    which must have reached your part of the country too. Without
    actually catching cold the little one has been quite upset ever
    since, probably by the crowd we had to struggle though. Will
    you be so kind as to go to Dr. Gachet and tell him that, if the
    weather is fine, we shall accept his invitation with great
    pleasure, but that we cannot absolutely promise it, and that,
    if we should come, we should like to be home again in the
    evening. There is a train at 5:58 which we might take. In the
    morning we could go by the 10:25 train, which arrives at
    Chaponval at 11:26. The doctor told us to get off the train
    there, and that he wanted to come get us.</p>

    <p>My dear fellow, I had to let this letter go for a while, and
    now I must finish it in a hurry. The exhibition gives me a lot
    of work, but also satisfaction.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">Tasset sent the colours today; they will go off tomorrow
    together with the Bargues.</label> <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Guillaumin has placed at your disposal a magnificent picture
    which he had at Tangui's, a Sunset. It will show to great
    advantage in your studio.</p>

    <p>Gausson will make an exchange with you, anything you would
    like to have from him as against anything you would like to
    give him. I told him he must go with me someday to see you at
    home. Aurier will come too one of these days. <art id=0620>He is delighted
    with your picture</art>, and will come with me on a Sunday to look
    you up.</p>

    <p>Now I must say goodbye. In any case I should come myself at
    the appointed hour. Kindest regards from Jo, and a smile from
    the little one.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>

    <p>Don't tire yourself, and take care of your health; kind
    regards to the doctor. Did your things arrive?</p>

    <p>See Vincent's letter 637.</p>
