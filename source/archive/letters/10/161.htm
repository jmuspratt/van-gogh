  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>I am very glad that you wrote to Father and Mother about a
    few things, as I asked you. I think it can only have a good
    influence - at least gradually. Of course you understand that I
    am not the man intentionally to grieve Father and Mother with
    anything. When I must do something contrary to their wishes and
    which often grieves them without cause, I feel very sorry about
    it myself.</p>

    <p>But don't think that the recent regrettable scene was caused
    only by hot temper. Alas, previously when I declared that I
    would not continue with my study in Amsterdam, and later in the
    Borinage when I refused to do what the clergymen there wanted
    me to do, Father said something similar. So there is indeed a
    lasting, deep-rooted misunderstanding between Father and
    myself. And I believe that it never can be <i>quite</i> cleared
    up. But on both sides we can respect each other because we
    agree in so many things, though sometimes we have quite
    different - aye, even opposite - views.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.Father">So I do not consider Father an enemy, but a friend who would
    be even more my friend if he were less afraid that I might
    &ldquo;infect&rdquo; him with French &ldquo;errors&rdquo; (?).
    I think if Father understood my real intentions, I could often
    be of some use to him, even with his sermons, because I
    sometimes see a text in quite a different light. But Father
    thinks my opinion entirely wrong, considers it contraband, and
    systematically rejects it.</label></p>

    <p>Now in regard to the &ldquo;case in question,&rdquo; as
    Uncle Stricker calls what happened between Kee and me, I must
    tell you that I have risked an attack on the above-mentioned
    Mr. S.: by means of a registered letter. I was afraid
    unregistered letters would be ignored, but he will be obliged
    to read this one, and in it I have tried to draw his attention
    to some points which I fear he overlooked or which he would
    take no notice of. It is a very &ldquo;undiplomatic&rdquo;
    letter, very bold, but I am sure it will at least make an
    impression on him. But perhaps at first it will cause him to
    use a certain expletive which he certainly would not use in a
    sermon.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.clergy">There really are no more unbelieving and hard-hearted and
    worldly people than clergymen and especially clergymen's wives
    (a rule with exceptions). But even clergymen sometimes have a
    human heart under three layers of steel armour.</label></p>

    <p>But I am in terrible suspense and am quite ready to go to
    Amsterdam, except that the journey is very expensive and I must
    not waste my powder; the trip to Amsterdam is my reserve if my
    letter has no effect.</p>

    <p>Do you know that Uncle Stricker is really a very clever man,
    in fact, an artist? His books are very good and give proof of
    deep feeling. This summer I read a little book he had just
    published on the &ldquo;minor prophets&rdquo; and a few of the
    other less known books in the Bible. So I certainly hope that
    after some time has passed, there will be more sympathy between
    us than there has been hitherto.</p>

    <p>The letter I received from him a few months ago was not
    unsympathetic or written in anger, but he wrote very
    positively, &ldquo;Her <i>no</i> is quite decisive.&rdquo; But
    when, notwithstanding this letter, I continued to write Kee, he
    thought the intervention of Prinsenhage would put a spoke in my
    wheel. This spoke did not prove strong enough. It was not the
    lever to lift me off my feet.</p>

    <p>Apropos! you must write me soon. I have often thought over
    what I wrote you.</p>

    <p>If you thought I meant to insinuate that if a man's passions
    were, for instance, ambition in business or financial affairs,
    he must clip their wings, tone them down, or quite overcome
    them, you were mistaken. On the contrary, but those passions
    must bear more and a better kind of fruit. They must not
    decrease, but be counter-balanced by love. <i>Greed</i> is a
    very ugly word, but that demon does not let anybody alone; I
    should be greatly astonished if it hadn't sometimes tempted you
    and me, even to the extent that for the moment we were inclined
    to say, &ldquo;Money is the ruler, money can do everything,
    money is No. 1.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Not that you or I really bow to that Mr. Mammon and serve
    him, but it is true that he worries you and me a great deal.
    Me, by poverty through many a year; you, through a high salary.
    These two both present the temptation to bow to the power of
    money. We may be more or less strong in those temptations, but
    I hope neither you nor I are destined to become entirely the
    prey of that money devil; but won't he get some hold on us? Now
    that money devil may not play you the trick of making you think
    it a crime to earn much money and making me think that there is
    some merit in my poverty. No indeed, there is no merit in being
    so slow to earn money as I am, and I shall have to remedy that;
    and you will give me many a useful hint, I hope.</p>

    <p>But it certainly is my conviction that your attention, your
    best, your most concentrated, attention must be centered at
    this time on the development of a vital force which is still
    slumbering within you - Love. For indeed, of all powers it is
    the most powerful - it makes us dependent in appearance only;
    the truth is, there is no real independence, no real liberty,
    no steady self-reliance, except through Love. I say, our sense
    of duty is sharpened and our work becomes clear to us through
    Love; and in loving and fulfilling the duties of love we
    perform God's will. In the Bible it is not written in vain,
    &ldquo;Love will cover a multitude of sins&rdquo; [see I Pet.
    4:8], and again, &ldquo;In Thee O God will be mercy, that Thou
    wilt be feared&rdquo; [see Ps. 130:4]. But I think you will
    derive more profit from rereading Michelet than from the
    Bible.</p>

    <p>As for me, I could not do without Michelet for anything in
    the world. It is true the Bible is eternal and everlasting, but
    Michelet gives such very practical and clear hints, so directly
    applicable to this hurried and feverish modern life in which
    you and I find ourselves, that he helps us to progress rapidly;
    we cannot do without him. The Bible consists of different parts
    and there is growth from one to the next; for instance, there
    is a difference between Moses and Noah on the one hand, and
    Jesus and Paul on the other. Now take Michelet and Beecher
    Stowe: they don't tell you the Gospel is no longer of any value
    but they show how it may be applied in our time, in this our
    life, by you and me, for instance. Michelet even expresses
    completely and aloud things which the Gospel whispers only the
    germ of.</p>

    <p>You must not be astonished when, even at the risk of your
    taking me for a fanatic, I tell you that in order to love, I
    think it absolutely necessary to believe in God. To believe in
    God (that does not mean that you should believe all the sermons
    of the clergymen and the arguments and Jesuitism of the
    &ldquo;b&eacute;gueules d&eacute;votes collet
    mont&eacute;&rdquo; [bigoted, genteel prudes], far from it); to
    me, to believe in God is to feel that there is a God, not dead
    or stuffed but alive, urging us toward aimer encore with
    irresistible force - that is my opinion.</p>

    <p>I have sent Mauve a drawing of a man digging potatoes in the
    field; I wanted to show him some sign of life. I wish he would
    come soon. As soon as he has seen my studies, I will send you
    some again. If you do not like my writing you so often and so
    long, then say Stop; but perhaps there will soon be another
    reason for stopping, for instance when the time left for
    correspondence will all have to be devoted to <i>her</i>. These
    very long letters will not continue forever.</p>

    <p>It is so curious that I am entirely in the dark about what
    is going on in Amsterdam: I mean, I don't <i>know</i> anything,
    but only <i>feel</i>. How can one feel things at a distance?
    Indeed, I can't explain it to you, but just fall in love
    yourself, and then perhaps you will also hear voices in the
    distance, and see little things which lead you to surmise
    bigger ones - as one guesses there is a fire from seeing the
    smoke. Fortunately the weather is warm and calm: that has a
    beneficial influence on people. If it were biting cold with a
    north wind, my &ldquo;case in question&rdquo; would be worse
    off.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile Uncle and Aunt Stricker's silver wedding is
    approaching; Father and Mother intend to go there. I am very
    glad you have written them before that time, for I would rather
    not have them come out with their &ldquo;conscientious
    objections&rdquo; to &ldquo;the untimeliness and
    indelicacy&rdquo; of my love. Hoping to hear from you again,
    believe me, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>You must be sure that I try very hard to change many things
    in myself - especially the sad state of my money affairs. And
    then I also think it would be good for me to associate more
    with other people.</p>

    <p>Now the best and most effective way to better myself
    financially is to work hard. &ldquo;Travaillez, prenez de la
    paine, c'est le fonds qui manque le moins.&rdquo; But this
    alone is not sufficient, or rather, there are still other
    things for which I must work. Perhaps it is not bad that I have
    lived so long &ldquo;underground,&rdquo; as it were, that I
    have been &ldquo;one who has been down.&rdquo; But now I need
    not go back into the abyss, and I think it right to do away
    with all melancholy and to take a somewhat broader and more
    cheerful view of life - to walk on level ground, and to renew
    old relations as much as possible, and to enter into new
    ones.</p>

    <p>It may be that I shall meet with rebuff here and there, but
    I want to carry it through and try and struggle to the surface.
    I have often wondered whether it would not be possible and good
    to go to The Hague for a time, always considering the sphere of
    action here and the Brabant types my real work. Notwithstanding
    everything, I must hold onto this; now that I have grown
    familiar with it, I can find subjects here for years and years.
    But keeping at those Brabant types need not prevent my seeking
    new relations elsewhere, and even living elsewhere for a
    time.</p>

    <p>All artists and draughtsmen do.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I should like? Kee's beginning to say
    better things than &ldquo;no, never never&rdquo;; then it would
    be possible to plan an artistic campaign. But as things are
    now, I have first to fight &ldquo;Jesuitism,&rdquo; and must
    spend much of my energy on it; and second, I cannot begin
    another campaign before the &ldquo;case in question&rdquo; has
    been settled.</p>

    <p>Do you think Kee knows how terribly she unintentionally
    thwarts me? Well, she will have to make up for it afterward!!!
    That means I count on her joining in many artistic campaigns
    with me, you see.</p>

    <p>But I am afraid I am busy selling the skins of many bears
    that I have not yet killed. However, there is one bearskin with
    which I want to speculate.</p>

    <p>Recently Father said to me, &ldquo;My conscience has never
    allowed me to influence two people to marry.&rdquo; Well,
    personally my conscience tells me exactly the opposite. Luckily
    Michelet never had such scruples or else his books would never
    have been written. And out of gratitude to Michelet I promise
    that later on when I associate more with artists who so often
    &ldquo;beat about the bush,&rdquo; I shall do all I can to make
    it clear to them that they must marry. For the benefit of art
    dealers who are afraid that &ldquo;keeping a family&rdquo;
    costs more than not &ldquo;keeping a family,&rdquo; I add that
    a married artist with his wife spends less and is more
    productive than an unmarried one with a mistress.</p>

    <p>Do you think father Millet had more expenses than so many
    Italians and Spaniards who &ldquo;live in the desert where the
    sky is of brass and the soil of iron&rdquo;? Is a wife more
    expensive than a mistress? You do pay the mistress anyhow,
    Messrs. Art Dealers, and those ladies laugh at you behind your
    backs. &ldquo;Qui est-ce qui vous tire des carottes [who are
    cheating you&hellip;], messieurs Goupil et Cie? Les femmes
    comme il en faut&rdquo; - or &ldquo;les femmes comme il faut?
    On est s&ucirc;r de p&eacute;rir &agrave; part, on ne se sauve
    qu'ensemble.&rdquo; That is one of the things Michelet says so
    simply. Sometimes it seems that he must be mistaken, but later
    one sees that he was right after all.</p>

    <p>The saying, &ldquo;il faut les avoir aim&eacute;, puis
    d&eacute;saim&eacute;, puis aim&eacute; encore,&rdquo; can also
    be applied to Michelet's books.</p>

    <p>Do you think this mild weather will be mild enough to thaw
    the &ldquo;never, no, never&rdquo; one of these days? Will they
    expel me on or shortly after the silver wedding party? God
    forbid.</p>

    <p>Do you think that Trojan horse in the form of a registered
    letter has been taken inside the walls of Troy? And, if so,
    will the Greeks that were hidden in that horse - that is to
    say, the things that were written in the letter - storm the
    fortress?</p>

    <p>I am in the greatest suspense on that point. Adieu.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
