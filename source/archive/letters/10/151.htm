  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>As the whole family is writing to you again, I too enclose a
    little note. I certainly hope you are well, and will be able to
    find a half-hour to write me again.</p>

    <p>Now I will tell you what I have been doing since I wrote you
    last.</p>

    <p>In the first place, two large drawings (crayon and a little
    sepia), pollard willows - <art id=167_V-T_1510>somewhat like the sketch below [Drawings lost]</art>.</p>

    <p>Then another one, vertical, of the road to Leur [Drawing lost]. I also had
    a model again a few times, a digger and a basket weaver. <label content="art.supplies">And
    then last week I received from Uncle in Prinsenhage a paintbox
    which is still very good, certainly good enough to begin on (it
    is Paillard's paint). I am very glad to have it.</label></p>

    <p>I at once started to make a kind of watercolour, like the
    sketch below [Painting lost].</p>

    <p>[The second sketch in the above picture was drawn here.]</p>

    <p>I am very happy to get models. I am also trying to get a
    horse and a donkey.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">That thick Ingres paper I mentioned is especially good for
    painting in watercolour, and it is much cheaper than any other.
    Still, I am not in a hurry for it because I brought a supply
    from The Hague, but alas, it's plain white.</label></p>

    <p>Well, you see I am hard at work.</p>

    <p>Uncle goes to The Hague tomorrow and will perhaps talk over
    with Mauve the question of my going up to see him again.</p>

    <p>And now adieu. I have walked very far today and am very
    tired, but I would not let the letter go without enclosing a
    word.</p>

    <p>I hope things are well with you, a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
