    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Though it is only a short time since I wrote to you, I have
    something more to tell you now.</p>

    <p>For there has been a change in my drawings, both in the way
    I set about them and in the results.</p>

    <p>Also, as a consequence of some of the things Mauve told me,
    I have started working with live models again. Luckily I have
    been able to get several people to sit here for me, including
    Piet Kaufman, the labourer.</p>

    <p>Careful study and the constant and repeated copying of
    Bargue's Exercises au Fusain have given me a better insight
    into figure-drawing. I have learned to measure and to see and
    to look for the broad outlines, so that, thank God, what seemed
    utterly impossible to me before is slowly becoming possible
    now. I have drawn a man with a spade, that is un b&egrave;cheur
    [a digger], five times over in a variety of poses, a sower
    twice, a girl with a broom twice. Then <art id=1213>a woman in a white cap
    peeling potatoes</art> and a shepherd leaning on his
    crook and finally <art id=863>an old, sick peasant sitting on a chair by
    the hearth with his head in his hands and his elbows on his
    knees</art>.</p>

    <p>And it won't be left at that, of course. Once a few sheep
    have crossed the bridge, the whole flock follows. Now I must
    draw diggers, sowers, men and women at the plough,
    ceaslessly. Scrutinize and draw everything that is a part of country
    life. Just as many others have done and are doing. I no longer
    stand helpless before nature like I used to.</p>

    <p>[See illustrations Page 2 below]</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I brought along some cont&eacute;-crayon in wood (just like
    pencils) from The Hague, and I work with them a great deal
    now.</label></p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I have also started to introduce the brush and the stump.
    With a little sepia and India ink, and now and then with a
    little colour.</label></p>

    <p>What is quite certain is that the drawings I have been doing
    lately bear little resemblance to anything I have done
    before.</p>

    <p>The size of the figures is about the same as that of an
    <i>Exercices au Fusain.</i></p>

    <p>As for landscape, I don't see why it need suffer in any way
    as a result. On the contrary, it will gain. Enclosed are a few
    small sketches to give you an idea.</p>

    <p>Of course I have to pay the people who pose. Not much, but
    because it happens every day it is one more expense until I
    manage to sell some drawings.</p>

    <p>But since a figure is hardly ever a complete failure, I am
    sure that the outlay on the model will be fully recovered
    relatively soon.</p>

    <p>For nowadays anyone who has learned to tackle a figure and
    hang on to it until it is safely down on paper, can earn quite
    a bit. I need hardly tell you that I am only sending you
    these sketches to give you some idea of the pose. I dashed them
    off today in no time at all and can see that there is much
    wrong with the proportions, more so anyway than in the actual
    drawings. I've had a nice letter from Rappard, who seems to be
    hard at work. He sent me some very good landscape sketches. I
    wish he would come back here for a few days.</p>

    <p>[See illustrations Page 3 below]</p>

    <p>This is a field or rather a stubble, where they are plowing
    and sowing. Have made a fairly large sketch of it with
    a gathering thunderstorm.</p>

    <p>The other two sketches are poses of diggers. I hope to do
    several more of them.</p>

    <p>[See illustrations Pages 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 below]</p>

    <p><art id=865>The other sower has a basket</art>.</p>

    <p>I am tremendously anxious to get a woman to pose with a seed
    basket, so as to find a little figure like the one I showed you
    last spring and which you can see in the foreground of the
    first little sketch.</p>

    <p>Well, as Mauve says, the factory is in full swing.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">If you like and are able to, please remember the Ingres
    paper, the colour of unbleached linen, the stronger kind if
    possible.</label> In any case, write as soon as you can, and accept a
    handshake in my thoughts,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent.</p>
