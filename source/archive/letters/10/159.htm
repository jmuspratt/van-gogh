  <body>
    <p>Friday evening.</p>

    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>When I mailed my letter to you this morning, I had a feeling
    of relief.</p>

    <p>For a moment I had been in doubt - shall I tell him or not?
    - but on thinking it over, I came to the conclusion that it
    really was necessary. I sit writing to you now in the little
    room that is my studio now that the other room is so very damp.
    When I look around, I see the walls all covered with studies
    relating to one subject, &ldquo;<i>Brabant
    types</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So this is a work I have started, and if I were suddenly
    taken out of these surroundings, I should have to start anew on
    something else, and this one would remain half finished! That
    must not be! I have been working here since May, I am beginning
    to know and understand my models, my work is progressing; but
    it has cost me a lot of effort to get on so far.</p>

    <p>And now that I have got so far, Father would say, Because
    you write letters to Kee and therefore make trouble between us
    (<i>for this is the chief reason</i>, for whatever they may say
    of my being too unconventional, or the like, it is just talk),
    because difficulties arise, I am showing you the door.</p>

    <p>Isn't it too bad, and wouldn't it be ridiculous to stop a
    work that has been started, and is beginning to succeed, for
    that reason? No, no, it is not the way!</p>

    <p>Besides, the disagreement between Father and Mother and
    myself is not so terrible, is not of such a nature that we
    could not stay together. But Father and Mother are getting old,
    and they have prejudices and old-fashioned ideas which neither
    you nor I can share any more. When Father sees me with a French
    book by Michelet or Victor Hugo, he thinks of thieves and
    murderers, or of &ldquo;immorality&rdquo;; but it is too
    ridiculous, and of course I don't let myself be disturbed by
    such opinions. So often I have said to Father, Then just read
    it, even a few pages of such a book, and you will be impressed
    yourself; but Father obstinately refuses. Just now, when this
    love took root in my heart, I reread Michelet's book L'Amour et
    la Femme, and so many things became clear to me that would have
    otherwise been riddles. I told Father that under the
    circumstances I attached more value to Michelet's advice than
    to his own, if I had to choose which of the two I should
    follow.</p>

    <p>But then they bring up the story of a great-uncle who was
    infected with French ideas and took to drink, and so they
    insinuate that I shall do the same.</p>

    <p>Quelle mis&egrave;re!</p>

    <p>Father and Mother are very good to me in that they do
    everything to feed me well, etc. Of course I appreciate it very
    much; but it cannot be denied that food and drink and sleep are
    not enough for a man, that he longs for something nobler and
    higher - aye, he positively cannot do without it.</p>

    <p>That higher feeling which I cannot do without is love for
    Kee. Father and Mother argue in this way: <i>She says No, so
    you must resign yourself</i>. I do not see the necessity of
    this at all, on the contrary. And I would rather give up the
    work just begun and all the comforts of this home than resign
    myself to not writing her or her parents.</p>

    <p>Well, I write to you about it because at least my work
    certainly concerns you, for you are the one who has already
    given so much money to help me succeed. Now I am getting on, it
    progresses, I begin to see some light; and now I tell you,
    Theo, this threatens me. I ask no better than to work on
    quietly, but Father seems to want to put me out of the house,
    at least he said so this morning.</p>

    <p>A strong word from you can perhaps settle this matter.
    <i>You</i> will understand what I tell you: In order to work
    and to become an artist, one needs <i>love</i>. At least one
    who wants sentiment in his work must first feel it himself, and
    live with his heart.</p>

    <p>But Father and Mother are harder than stone in the matter of
    &ldquo;means of subsistence,&rdquo; as they call it. If it were
    a question of marrying immediately, I should certainly agree
    with them; but <i>now</i> it is a question of thawing a
    &ldquo;no, never never,&rdquo; and <i>that</i> a means of
    subsistence cannot do. It is quite another thing, a matter of
    the heart, and therefore she and I must see each other, write
    to each other, and speak to each other; it is as clear as
    daylight, and simple and reasonable. And indeed, I tell you
    (though they think me a weak character, a man of butter) that
    nothing in the world will make me give up this love. No
    delaying from day to day, from week to week, no <i>silent</i>
    waiting. The lark cannot be silent as long as he has a voice.
    What is to be done now?</p>

    <p>Wouldn't it be foolish, Theo, not to continue drawing those
    Brabant types now that I am getting on with them, simply
    because Father and Mother disapprove of my love?</p>

    <p>No - it must not be.</p>

    <p>For heaven's sake, let them give in for once; it would be
    too foolish for a young man to sacrifice his energy to the
    prejudices of an old man. And really, Father and Mother are
    prejudiced in this.</p>

    <p>No, brother, listen: it would be too bad if for this reason
    I should have to leave my work here and spend money elsewhere,
    where things would be much more expensive, instead of
    eventually earning a little money for a trip to Amsterdam. No,
    no, no, there is something wrong, it cannot be right that they
    want to put me out of the house just at this moment. There is
    no excuse, and it would thwart me in my work. So I cannot allow
    it.</p>

    <p>What would she think if she knew what happened this morning?
    She is so tender and kind that it pains her to say one unkind
    word, but if one so soft, so tender, so loving as she is roused
    - piqu&eacute;e au vif! - then woe to those who are the cause
    of this anger. May her anger not be roused against me, dear
    brother. I think she is beginning to understand that I am
    neither a thief nor a criminal, but, on the contrary, am
    inwardly more quiet and sensible than I appear outwardly. In
    the beginning she did not understand this - at first she really
    had an unfavourable impression of me - but now, I do not know
    why, while the sky becomes clouded and overcast with quarrels
    and curses, a light rises on her side.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, as soon as you send me the money for the journey,
    you will receive at once three drawings - &ldquo;Dinner
    Time,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lighting the Fire,&rdquo; &ldquo;Almshouse
    Man.&rdquo; So send the money if you can, for the journey will
    not be entirely in vain. If I have only 20 or 30 francs, I can
    at least see her face once more.</p>

    <p>And if you can, write a few words about that sentence of
    banishment, for I should like so much to go quietly on with my
    work here; that is what I should like best. I want her and her
    influence in order to reach a higher artistic level. Without
    her I am nothing, but with her there is a chance. To live, to
    work, and to love are really one. Well, adieu, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>One word from you, &ldquo;from Paris,&rdquo; will weight the
    scale against prejudices.</p>
