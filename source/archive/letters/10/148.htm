  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It was very pleasant to have you here again, and to have
    long talks together about everything. I always regret that we
    cannot be together much more. Not that I think talking in
    itself so valuable, but I mean that I wish we knew each other
    much better and more intimately than we do now. That thought
    occurred to me especially when coming back from Roozendaal
    after seeing you off at the station; also with regard to some
    things we said that last moment at the station.</p>

    <p>I am glad to see in the letter I got today that you hope to
    come back before very long. <label content="health.general">Of course I feel quite better now.
    The day after you left I stayed in bed, however, and had a long
    talk with Dr. Van Gent, a clever and practical man; not because
    I thought this insignificant malaise important, but rather
    because in general, either well or unwell, I like to talk with
    a doctor now and then, in order to know that everything is all
    right. If one occasionally hears a sound and true word about
    health, by and by one gets much clearer ideas about it; and if
    one knows what to do and what to avoid, one is not shaken like
    a reed by every wind and does not believe all the nonsense so
    often heard about health and ill health.</label></p>

    <p>For the rest, I am drawing the Exercices au Fusain on the
    Ingres paper you brought with you; it is difficult enough. It
    is much more inspiring to draw from nature than to copy such a
    page from the Bargues, but still I set myself the task of
    drawing them once more, and now for the last time. It would not
    be right if I paid too much attention to details and overlooked
    the great things when drawing from nature. And that was too
    much the case in my last drawings, I thought. Therefore I want
    to study Bargue's method again (he gives only broad lines and
    forms, and simple delicate outlines). And for the moment I have
    stopped drawing outdoors. When I go back to it shortly, I shall
    have a better view of things than before.</p>

    <p>In do not know if you ever read English books; if you do, I
    can strongly recommend that you read Shirley by Currer Bell,
    author of another book called Jane Eyre. It is as beautiful as
    pictures by Millet or Boughton or Herkomer. I found it at
    Prinsenhage and finished it in three days, though it is quite a
    voluminous book.</p>

    <p>I wish all people had what I am gradually beginning to
    acquire: the power to read a book in a short time without
    difficulty, and to keep a strong impression of it. In reading
    books, as in looking at paintings, one must admire what is
    beautiful with assurance - without doubt, without
    hesitation.</p>

    <p>I am busy rearranging all my books; I have read too much not
    to work on systematically to get at least an idea of modern
    literature. Sometimes I am so sorry that I do not know more
    about history, especially modern history. Well, being sorry and
    giving up doesn't help us on; the only thing to do is to push
    forward.</p>

    <p>I was very glad to detect now and then in your talk some
    very good philosophy. Who knows what a great thinker you may
    become in time. If you think Illusions Perdues by Balzac too
    long (two volumes), then try Le P&egrave;re Goriot, only one
    volume; once you have tried Balzac, you will prefer him to many
    others. Remember Balzac's nickname,
    &ldquo;v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire des maladies
    incurables.&rdquo; [Veterinary of incurable diseases.]</p>

    <p>By the time I have finished the Bargues, it will be autumn;
    that is a delightful time for drawing. I wish that Rappard
    would come back here then.</p>

    <p>I think I shall find a good model here in Piet Kaufman, the
    gardener, but I think it will be better to let him pose with a
    spade or plough or something like that - not here at home, but
    either in the yard or in his own home or in the field. But what
    a tough job it is to make people understand how to pose. Folks
    are desperately obstinate about it, and it is hard to make them
    yield on this point: they only want to pose in their Sunday
    best, with impossible folds in which neither knees, elbows,
    shoulder blades nor any other part of the body have left their
    characteristic dents or bumps. Indeed, that is one of the
    petites mis&egrave;res de la vie d'un dessinateur [small
    miseries of a draughtsman's life].</p>

    <p>Well, adieu, write when you can and receive a handshake in
    thought from</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
