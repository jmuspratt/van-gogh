    <p>Dear Uncle,</p>

    <p>As Theo is going to see you, and as I have a request to make
    of you, I am taking advantage of the opportunity to ask you the
    following:</p>

    <p>Whether you would allow me to come to see your pictures - I
    have not seen any pictures for such a long time, and I am
    longing to so much that I have decided to let bygones be
    bygones in order to ask this of you.</p>

    <p>Theo has taken along two small studies of mine - the colour
    of both is colder than I think right. I have two others the
    same size which are warmer. If you happen to have any old
    grooved frames which you have no immediate use for, it would
    please me very much to exchange one of these studies for a
    small frame.</p>

    <p>Yours truly, Vincent</p>
