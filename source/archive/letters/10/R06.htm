  <body>
    <p>Dear Rappard,</p>

    <p>On rereading your letters, my dear fellow, I find such
    lively and funny sallies in them that I feel stimulated,
    particularly by the latter, to continue our correspondence.<br>
     Well, well! So after all I am a fanatic! All right, for your
    words have gone home, right through my skin! So be it - thanks
    for your revelation, yes, thank God, at first I dared not
    believe it, but you have made it clear to me - so I have a
    will, a conviction, I am going in a definite direction, and
    what is more, not being contented with this, I want others to
    go along with me! Thank God, so I am a fanatic! Well, from now
    on I won't be anything else. And now I should like to have my
    friend Rappard as a fellow traveller - it is not a matter of
    indifference to me to lose sight of him - do you think I am
    wrong in this?<br>
     Now I said in my hurry that I wanted to drive people &ldquo;to
    the open sea&rdquo; (see my previous letter). If I did nothing
    but this, I should be a sorry barbarian. But there is something
    else which renders the thing more reasonable. In the long run a
    man cannot stick it out in the open sea - he must have a little
    cottage on the shore with a bit of fire on the hearth - with a
    wife and children around that hearth.<br>
     Look, Rappard, whither I am trying to drive myself, and
    whither I am trying to drive others too, is to be fishermen on
    the sea that we call the Ocean of Reality, but on the other
    hand I want - for myself and for the fellow creatures whom I
    importune now and then - that &ldquo;little cottage,&rdquo;
    most decidedly I do! And in that cottage, all those things! So
    the open sea and that resting place, or that resting place and
    the open sea. And as regards the doctrine I preach, this
    doctrine of mine - &ldquo;My friends, let us love what we
    love&rdquo; - is based on an axiom. I thought it superfluous to
    mention this axiom, but for clarity's sake I will add it. That
    axiom is: &ldquo;My friends, we love.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup> From
    this I deduce that first thesis.<br>
     My friends, let us love what we love, let us be ourselves,
    &ldquo;do not let us think we know better than God.&rdquo; This
    &ldquo;do not let us think we know better than God&rdquo; is
    not my expression, it belongs to Mauve. And this thesis I prove
    by negative demonstration, i.e. in the following way to begin
    with.<br>
     Suppose a man did not love what he loves, what a lot of misery
    he would cause himself and others, and how much turbulence he
    would create in God's world. In short, if all men were like the
    person who, as we suppose - at least if this is possible - for
    the moment, does not love what he loves, how the world (which,
    I think, our Lord put squarely on its feet, which is kept in
    that position by Him, and which will stay that way as long as
    you and I are alive - which will serve our time, you
    know!)...if, I say, all men were like this imaginary one,
    willfully turned inside out and upside down - (and how
    fortunate it is that he can only exist in our imagination as an
    abstraction, just like our proof by negative demonstration of
    an unmathematical thesis) - how much the world, correctly
    created by God, would gradually seem to become a radically
    wrong world. Methinks, by continuing to work with this
    abstraction in our imagination - and this only for a short,
    even a very short while - I mean, with the above actually
    nonexistent man, willfully turned inside out and upside down -
    we cannot help feeling it goes so much &ldquo;against the
    grain&rdquo; that we are entitled to think we have proved
    definitely the correctness and reasonableness of our thesis:
    &ldquo;My friends, let us love what we love.&rdquo; (Besides,
    if I have not demonstrated clearly enough that the
    incorrectness of the said thesis would be an enormous
    <i>absurdity</i>, you, who are much further advanced in
    mathematics than I, would easily succeed - if you would give
    your mind to it - in finding more conclusive proofs for my
    thesis.)<br>
     We now come to some remarkable conclusions or
    &ldquo;deductions&rdquo; from our primary thesis, as for
    instance:</p>

    <p>1. The man who damn well refuses to love what he loves dooms
    himself.<br>
     2. He must have quite a lot of o(a)bstinatie, to stick it out
    in the long run (The <i>o</i> and the <i>a</i> happen both to
    be appropriate, eh?) [This pun is untranslatable. The Dutch
    word <i>obstinatie</i> means &ldquo;obstinacy,&rdquo; and the
    (incidentally incorrect) word <i>abstinatie</i> (correct:
    <i>abstinentie</i>) means &ldquo;abstinence.&rdquo;]<br>
     3. If he changed, wouldn't his conversion be a great
    thing!</p>

    <p>Yes, and whether I add it or not, I think you will
    understand that I am suggesting more or less, Rappard, by
    sticking so close to the academy you are clinging to a
    reservation as to a rope that has &ldquo;strangled&rdquo; many
    a one - I mean, who could not cut himself loose when he wanted
    to put to sea.<br>
     Are there still other &ldquo;reservations&rdquo; besides the
    academic ones? See the chapter &ldquo;eye beams&rdquo; in my
    previous letter. There are, if you will allow me to say so, as
    many kinds of reservations as there are kinds of eye beams.<br>
     How many? Legions, I tell you, legions!<br>
     This &ldquo;being strangled&rdquo; by a reservation is a much
    slower and more agonizing death than stoutly hanging oneself by
    means of a halter. Are there also moral reservations? Why
    shouldn't there be, just as there are moral &ldquo;eye
    beams&rdquo;? But you and I, have we laboured under them, are
    we labouring under them, shall we labour under them?<br>
     Goodness gracious - I am far from sure, and if I were speaking
    for myself instead of for the two of us, I should say, I have
    laboured, am labouring and shall labour under moral eye beams
    and moral reservations, but this has not altered, does not
    alter and will not alter the fact that I have cast, am casting
    and shall go on casting moral beams out of my eyes, and that I
    have chucked away, am chucking away and shall go on chucking
    away moral reservations.<br>
     Until in the end I shall stand with a clear eye and a free
    neck.<br>
     When?<br>
     If I persevere until the end - in the end.<br>
     But I feel sure you will see that by continuing our
    correspondence we get so much profit out of it that gradually
    this correspondence is getting more serious.<br>
     For though, as I said, I give my imagination a free rein, yet
    I swear that I write in dead earnest, and not the reverse.
    Nothing is further from my thoughts than writing you out of a
    lust for argument, but my intention is &ldquo;to wake Rappard
    up,&rdquo; and I doubt whether I shall drop off myself when
    &ldquo;waking Rappard up.&rdquo; God forbid that this should be
    the case - far be it from me!<br>
     Now I told you on a former occasion that in general, and more
    especially with artists, I pay as much attention to the man who
    does the work as to the work itself. If the man is not there, I
    am now and then forced to draw conclusions from the work only
    (we cannot know all artists personally), or if the work is not
    there, to form an opinion of the man by himself. Now I know
    something of the work of a certain Mr. Van Rappard, and
    secondly something of the gentleman himself.<br>
     His work is always saying to me, Better is to come; his person
    is saying the same thing to me.<br>
     Better and better.<br>
     Do you think this a very merciless judgment? And (to jump from
    one subject to another) as regards my special &ldquo;b&ecirc;te
    noire,&rdquo; today I had little opportunity to occupy myself
    with hunting it; but for all that I have not been able to
    refrain from attacking it a little.<br>
     And we shall have a bone to pick with it by and by. But it is
    beginning to be a little on its guard; the fact is that
    resignation is accustomed to resignation, and I thought it
    would give up the struggle. But lo! I am not yet in a mood for
    it. Oh well, later on I shall probably tell you something more
    about the said b&ecirc;te noire. Damned b&ecirc;te noire! And
    yet it amuses me.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile believe me, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I am writing you pretty often now, as shortly I shall have a
    lot of other correspondence to attend to.</p>
