  <body>
    <p>Dear Brother,</p>

    <p>I have just received your letter. Thanks for your sympathy,
    thanks for the money &ldquo;for the ticket.&rdquo; Thanks for
    your opinion about my drawings, though it is more favourable
    than I deserve. Continue writing me about my work. Do not fear
    your remarks will hurt me; I will take such criticism as proofs
    of sympathy, worth a thousand times more than flattery. You
    tell me practical things, from you I must learn to become
    practical; so preach me many a sermon, for I do not refuse to
    be converted and I am greatly in need of conversion.<br>
     I do not think I ever received money more gratefully than
    those ten guilders from you, for the thought that, if I
    <i>had</i> to go, I should be unable to, was so unbearable to
    me; now I have at least one string to my bow. I should have
    gone long ago if I had only had the ten guilders. However, I
    must be sure of <i>her</i> being at home when I go. Now I am
    corresponding continually with our sister Willemien, who is on
    the lookout and will warn me, for <i>she</i> is going to
    Haarlem; I shall hear from W. when <i>she</i> goes back to
    Amsterdam.<br>
     Oh, Theo, there is so much depth in her character, but one
    does not see it at once. She, you and I, we all have an outer
    bark of lightheartedness, but inside is a trunk of firmer wood,
    and hers is of a fine grain! Well, we shall see how things
    go.<br>
     If you too should perhaps have a love story, tell me all about
    it, and trust my discretion. If I were not &ldquo;one who has
    been down,&rdquo; but on the contrary one who has always stood
    firm, I should be worse than useless to you, but as I have been
    in that mysterious deep well of misery of the heart, there is a
    shadow of a chance that I may be able to give you some
    practical advice in some affair of the heart. I go to you for
    help with my drawings and practical affairs, who knows whether
    I for my part cannot be of some use to you in relation to some
    difficulties in love.<br>
     For myself I learn much from father Michelet. Be sure to read
    L'Amour et la Femme, and if you can get it, My Wife and I, and
    Our Neighbors by Beecher Stowe, or Jane Eyre and Shirley by
    Currer Bell. Those people can tell you more and better things
    than I can.<br>
     The men and women who may be considered to stand at the head
    of modem civilization - for instance Michelet and Beecher
    Stowe, Carlyle and George Eliot and so many others - they call
    to you:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, man, whoever you are, with a heart in your bosom,
    help us to found something real, eternal, true; limit yourself
    to one profession and love one woman only. Let your profession
    be a modern one and may you help your wife to attain a modern
    soul, deliver her from the terrible prejudices which shackle
    her. Have no doubt of God's help if you do what God wants you
    to do, and God wants us in these days to reform the world by
    reforming morals, by renewing the light and the fire of eternal
    love. By these means you will succeed and at the same time have
    a good influence on those around you, be the number large or
    small, according to your circumstances.&rdquo;<br>
     In my opinion these are the words that Michelet says to us in
    general. We are full-grown men now and are standing like
    soldiers in the rank and file of our generation. We do not
    belong to the same one as Father and Mother and Uncle Stricker;
    we must be more faithful to the modern than to the old one - to
    look back toward the old one is fatal. If the older people do
    not understand us, it must not upset us, and we must go our own
    way against their will; later on they will say of their own
    accord, Yes, you were right after all.<br>
     Though perhaps you will now think me rather well informed in
    some things, in many others, you will find me very stupid and
    ignorant - alas, in this feverish and hurried modem life we
    become so one-sided. But should you or I doubt our right to
    propose to a girl, and should we be doubtful of our success in
    the end?<br>
     No doubt it is presumptuous to be sure of oneself, but one
    certainly may believe, My soul's anguish will not have been in
    vain, and I will fight my battle notwithstanding all my own
    weaknesses and faults; I will fight as well as I can.<br>
     Though I fall ninety-nine times, the hundredth time I shall
    stand. And what are they talking about means of subsistence
    for, as if I had none! What artist has not struggled and
    toiled, and what other way is there but struggling and toiling
    to gain a foothold. And since when has a draughtsman no chance
    of earning his living?<br>
     I began to draw a man busy digging potatoes in a field again.
    And I put in a little more of the surroundings. Some bushes in
    the background, and a streak of sky. I cannot tell you, boy,
    how beautiful that field is! When I have earned a little more
    money and am able to spend more on models, I tell you I shall
    make quite different things still.<br>
     But it is hard work for the models too, I can tell you. The
    more so because those I have are not professional models, and
    perhaps that much better for it. If you ever have a chance to
    get somebody interested in my work, I think you can now begin
    to speak about me with some assurance. But in order to do
    better work, I shall have to spend more on models. Now I spend
    20, 25 or 30 cents a day, but I cannot do that every day, and
    it really is not enough; by spending a little more, I could
    make more rapid progress.<br>
     Well, this winter I shall not be able to work in the open air
    with a model, but I can work indoors, and that is beautiful
    too. Once more, thanks for the money, boy! It is very kind of
    you and very humane! A warm handshake in thought, and believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
