  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>My best wishes for your birthday.<label content="feelings.nostalgia"> I often think of your
    visit; I am glad that we saw each other again, and hope you
    will come back this summer.</label> I have been here a few days now and
    it is splendid outdoors, but the weather does not as yet permit
    drawing in the open air every day. Meanwhile, I have started on
    the Millets. <art id=830>The <i>Semeur</i> </art>is finished and
    I have sketched the Quatre heures de la journ&eacute;e. And now
    I still have to do <i>les Travaux des champs.</i></p>

    <p>As you know there was an exhibition of watercolours in
    Brussels - it was rather interesting. Among the Dutch there
    were 4 or 5 Mauves, &ldquo;Woodcutters&rdquo;; J. Maris,
    &ldquo;Dunes,&rdquo; like a picture by Ruysdael or Van de
    Velde; then J. H. Weissenbruch, 5 superb large drawings;
    Roelofs, also 5 large ones; then Gabri&euml;l, and Van de Sande
    Bakhuyzen, and Valkenburg, and Van Trigt, and P. Stortenbeker,
    and Vogel, etc.</p>

    <p>Then there was a Mesdag that kept one from looking at any
    other drawing, at least it did for me. The beach at twilight,
    stormy weather, a sky with grey clouds, and the ruddy glow of
    the setting sun. In the foreground a fisherman on horseback - a
    tall, strange, dark silhouette standing out against the white
    foaming waves. This figure is speaking with people aboard a
    fishing smack that is riding on the waves in the middle
    distance. On deck some people are busy with a lantern, and they
    are talking to the man on horseback, apparently about the
    anchor which he must come and take ashore. It is a large,
    important drawing, done broadly and so vigorous that, as I told
    you, nothing else can really be compared to it.</p>

    <p>There were two drawings by Ter Meulen which struck me, too,
    &ldquo;Sheep in the Dunes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sheep in the
    Snow&rdquo;; he is progressing well. If I remember correctly, I
    saw that man at Bakhuyzen's studio, drudging and plodding
    along, and yet he has arrived now, at least these two drawings
    were excellent. Then there were drawings by Meunier:
    &ldquo;Varlet dans une Grange&rdquo; [Peasant Boy in a Barn],
    refined in colour and tone, and also in conception, reminding
    one of Millet, for instance, in its simplicity and faithfulness
    to nature; and also &ldquo;A Stoker &rdquo; and &ldquo;A Factory
    Hand.&rdquo; There were several drawings by Rochussen, too, and
    many others; but of the Belgians, only Meunier appealed to
    me.</p>

    <p>Rappard is going to Holland in three weeks, and this summer
    he will probably work in the country, then perhaps go to Paris
    next winter; but right now it looks as though he's not going to
    stay there. I think he got a cold shower there at one time, but
    that's no reason why he shouldn't be more fortunate next time.
    It certainly is true that he's made great progress since
    then.</p>

    <p>I am very glad things have been arranged so that I shall be
    able to work here quietly for a while. I hope to make as many
    studies as I can, for that is the seed which must later produce
    the drawings.</p>

    <p>Write to me now and then and, if possible, keep me informed
    of the things that strike you; and if you should hear of a
    vacancy for a draughtsman, think of me.</p>

    <p>And now it is mail time. I will let you know what I am
    doing, and I hope you will occasionally advise me on what
    subjects to choose for drawing; sometimes it will be of use to
    me, sometimes, perhaps not - but tell me what you think. I will
    do the same for you, and then on both sides we must try to sift
    the chaff from the grain. Adieu, a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
