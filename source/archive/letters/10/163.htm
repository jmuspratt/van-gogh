  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Perhaps you have been expecting a word from me to hear what
    I am doing these days. And I for my part have been looking for
    a word from you.</p>

    <p>I still go to Mauve's every day - in the daytime to paint,
    in the evening to draw.</p>

    <p>I have now painted five studies and two watercolours and, of
    course, a few more sketches.</p>

    <p>I cannot tell you how kind and friendly Mauve and Jet are to
    me these days. And Mauve has shown and told me things which of
    course I cannot do at once, but which I shall gradually put
    into practice. But I must work very hard, and when I return to
    Etten I shall have to make a few changes; among other things, I
    must try to rent a large room somewhere so that I can have
    sufficient distance - otherwise it is impossible to draw the
    figure, except for studying certain segments.</p>

    <p>I am consulting Mauve about this question and I will soon
    write you about it again.</p>

    <p>The painted studies are <art id=001a>still life</art>,
    the watercolours are made after the model, <art id=869>a
    Scheveningen girl</art> <art id=870> </art><art id=871> </art>.</p>

    <p>[<art id=185_V-T_1630>A sketch of a Scheveningen Girl drawn here.</art>]</p>

    <p>Perhaps Mauve will write you himself some time soon.</p>

    <p>But, Theo, now it is almost a month since I came here, and
    you must understand I have had a great many expenses. It is
    true that Mauve has given me several things, paint, etc., but I
    had to buy a great deal myself, and I have also paid the model
    for a few days.<label content="lifestyle.clothing"> And I needed a pair of shoes, </label>and in short, I
    haven't watched every penny I've spent. So I have overdrawn the
    200-franc limit, as all told this trip has cost me 90 guilders.
    And now I think that Father is rather hard up himself for the
    moment, and I do not know what to do. Personally, I should like
    to stay here longer, even renting a room here, for instance at
    Scheveningen for a few months (and perhaps even longer); but
    the way things are, perhaps it is better for me to go back to
    Etten. I think Scheveningen and its types and figures so
    splendid. But the models are very expensive - 1.50 or 2
    guilders a day, some even more. But here one comes in contact
    with painters, etc.</p>

    <p>When I wrote Father this week for money, he thought it so
    very excessive that I had spent 90 guilders. But you will
    understand, I think, that this is not unreasonable, for
    everything is so expensive. But I hate to have to account to
    Father for every cent I spend, the more so because it is told
    to everybody, not without enlargements and exaggerations.</p>

    <p>So I must say, Theo, that just now I am rather hard up here.
    And I am writing to tell you so. I have no money to stay, I
    have no money to go back. I shall wait here for a few days at
    all events. And I will do as you wish.</p>

    <p>Do you think it better for me to stay here a little longer?
    I should be very glad to, and I would not go back until I had
    made some progress.</p>

    <p>If you want me to go back at once, I will, but I must find a
    good room somewhere, somewhat larger than the little studio at
    home; then I can get along alone for some time, and go back to
    The Hague after a while.</p>

    <p>At all events, Theo, through Mauve I have got some insight
    into the mysteries of the palette and of watercolouring. And
    that will repay me for the 90 guilders the trip has cost. Mauve
    says that the sun is rising for me, but is still behind the
    clouds. Well, I have nothing to say against that.</p>

    <p>Sometime I will tell you more about how kind and considerate
    Mauve has been to me.</p>

    <p>So I shall wait a few more days for your answer. But if it
    does not come within three or four days, I shall ask Father for
    money to go back at once.</p>

    <p>I have several things to tell, which will possibly interest
    you, about the manner of drawing after the model at Etten; but
    as I said before, I will write you about it again soon.
    Enclosed I send you little sketches after the two watercolours.
    <label content="business.selling">I confidently hope that I shall be able to make something
    saleable in a relatively short time. Yes, <i>I even think that
    these two would be saleable in case of need</i>. Especially the
    one which Mauve has brushed a little. But I would rather keep
    them myself for a time in order to remember better some things
    about the way in which they were done.</label></p>

    <p>What a splendid thing watercolour is to express atmosphere
    and distance, so that the figure is surrounded by air and can
    breathe in it, as it were. Now would you like me to make
    another set of watercolours for you here? I ask no better, but
    lodgings here, and the models and the paint and paper, etc.,
    etc. - everything costs money, and I have nothing left. So at
    all events send me word by return mail, and if you wish me to
    stay, send me some money if possible.</p>

    <p>I think I shall make better progress now that I have learned
    something practical about colour and the use of the brush.</p>

    <p>And you can imagine that I hope Mauve will never have cause
    to regret his kindness. We will try to push ahead with some
    force. Well, adieu. At all events I count on your writing by
    return mail (address A. Mauve, Uilenboomen 198). Believe me,
    with a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
