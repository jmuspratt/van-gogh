  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>In my opinion your letter must be answered on the spot. In
    the first place I want you to know that it interests me very
    much - more than any other letter I have received from you - I
    learned more from it than you yourself meant to write down.</p>

    <p>I learned from it that my friend Rappard has taken a great
    step forward, or will do so shortly. Why? Oh, it doesn't matter
    right now, but I have my reasons for believing that you have
    reached a point of revolution and reform. &Ccedil;a ira! Within
    a short time there will be fire and enthusiasm in you.
    &Ccedil;a ira! But for the moment not another word about it in
    this letter.</p>

    <p>But if by chance you should be surprised at what I have told
    you, I hope to be able to tell you more soon in person. For in
    any case I expect to see you soon, whether you come by way of
    Breda or Rozendaal.</p>

    <p>In the first place, on my parents' behalf I invite you to
    come and stay with us one of these days, for a longer or
    shorter time. So it is not necessary for you to ask if it is
    convenient, you will only have to write: I shall come on this
    or that day by this or that train.</p>

    <p>If it is impossible for you to come and stay a few days,
    then I count on your skipping a train, either at the station at
    Breda or at Rozendaal, and on your letting me know by letter or
    postcard the hour and place of your arrival. Then I shall be on
    the spot according to your information. And then I shall bring
    along a number of drawings, the large one, &ldquo;Worn
    out,&rdquo; and several others that you do not know at all. I
    need not tell you that I hope that on the same occasion you on
    your part will show me some of your watercolours, as I am
    anxious to see them.</p>

    <p>Look, we really must arrange to meet somehow one of these
    days. There is only one thing which might prevent me from
    coming to the station on the day of your passing through, but
    it is most unlikely that it should happen just on that very
    day. It is like this: Mauve is going to Prinsenhage for a day,
    and after that he will come and spend a day here. We hope it
    will happen soon, but we don't yet know which day it will be.
    And when Mauve is here, I go where Mauve goes. Suppose you were
    staying here when Mauve came, would you think that so
    unpleasant? I don't think you would; I don't know whether you
    know Mauve personally, but I think meeting him or meeting him
    again would be a good thing indeed. Mauve gave me courage when
    I needed it not long ago. He is a man of genius.</p>

    <p>Now you are thinking seriously of going to Brussels until
    Christmas to paint from the nude.</p>

    <p>Well, in your case I can well understand it, and especially
    in your present mood I shall see you go with an easy mind. Ce
    que doir arriver arrivera - what must happen will happen.</p>

    <p>Whether you go to Brussels or not, some new flame will be
    kindled in you. &Ccedil;a ira, and your going to Brussels or
    not will make little difference, but the caterpillar will
    become a butterfly; in this I am speaking like a fellow
    adventurer.</p>

    <p>I feel sure you need not think that a few days' stay at
    Etten would mean a neglect of duty; on the contrary, you may
    take it for granted that it will be devoting yourself to duty,
    for neither you nor I should be idle here.</p>

    <p>You can do some figure drawing here too if you want to. I am
    not sure whether I told you that my uncle at Prinsenhage saw
    the little sketches in your letter and thought them very good,
    and noticed with pleasure that you are making progress in
    figure drawing as well as in landscape.</p>

    <p>I am of the opinion, Rappard, that in the beginning you
    should work from <i>the clothed</i> model. Most certainly one
    must have a sound knowledge of the nude, but in reality we have
    to do with figures with clothes on. Unless you intend to go the
    way of Baudry, Lefebyre, Henner, and so many others who
    specialize in the nude. Of course in that case you should study
    the nude almost exclusively; in that case the more you confine
    yourself to it and concentrate on it, the better. But in point
    of fact, I do not think you will take this road. You have too
    much liking for other things. You think a poor woman gathering
    potatoes in a field, a digger, a sower, a little lady in the
    street or at home, too beautiful not to feel the impulse to
    attack them in quite a different manner than you have done up
    to now. You have too much feeling for colour, too keen a
    perception of tone, you are too much of a landscapist to follow
    in Baudry's footsteps. The more so because I believe that you,
    Rappard, will ultimately decide to settle down in Holland too.
    You are too much of a <i>Dutchman</i> to become a Baudry. But I
    certainly think it excellent that you paint such beautiful
    studies from the nude as the two big ones I know - the
    reclining pose and the brown seated figure - and I wish I had
    done them myself. I am telling you my thoughts unreservedly,
    and you on your part must always tell me yours unreservedly
    too. Your remark about the figure of the Sower - that he is not
    a man who is sowing, but one who is posing as a sower - is very
    true [F857, JH 032].</p>

    <p>However, I look upon my present studies purely as studies
    after the model, they have no pretension to being anything
    else.</p>

    <p>Only after a year or a couple of years shall I have gained
    the ability to do a sower who is sowing; there I agree with
    you.</p>

    <p>You tell me, Rappard, that you have done hardly anything for
    a fortnight. Surely I know these &ldquo;fortnights&rdquo;; I
    had them myself last summer. I did not work at drawing directly
    - but indirectly I did; what I did was go through one of those
    periods of metamorphosis.</p>

    <p>I saw Mesdag's &ldquo;Panorama.&rdquo; I was there with the
    painter De Bock, who collaborated on it, and he told me of an
    incident that happened after the Panorama was finished and that
    I thought quite funny.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you know the painter Destr&eacute;e. Between you and
    me and the lamppost: the incarnation of mealy-mouthed
    arrogance. Well, one day this gentleman came up to De Bock and
    said to him, very haughtily, very blandly, very
    condescendingly, &ldquo;De Bock, I was invited to paint that
    Panorama too, but because it was so inartistic, I
    refused.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>To which De Bock answered, &ldquo;Mr. Destr&eacute;e, what
    is easier, to paint a Panorama or to refuse to paint a
    Panorama? What is more artistic, to do a thing or not to do
    it?&rdquo; I thought this answer very much to the point</p>

    <p>I have good news from my brother Theo - he sends his kind
    regards. Do not neglect to keep up your acquaintance with him
    by writing him once in a while. He is a clever, energetic
    fellow, and I am very sorry he isn't a painter, although it is
    a good thing for the painters that there are such persons as
    he. This you will find out if you keep up your acquaintance
    with him.</p>

    <p>And now I shall say, &ldquo;See you soon.&rdquo; Shall I?
    And believe me, with a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I am looking for a poem, I think by Tom Hood, &ldquo;The
    Song of the Shirt&rdquo;; do you happen to know it, or do you
    see your way to hunting it up for me? If you know it, I should
    like to ask you to write it out for me.</p>

    <p>After I had closed this letter I opened it again to tell you
    that, although I quite understand your having made your plans,
    yet I want you to consider whether you will positively carry
    them out after all.</p>

    <p>Speaking my mind unreservedly, I say to you, Rappard, stay
    here. But of course there may be reasons of which I am ignorant
    but which are weighty enough to make you decide on that
    plan.</p>

    <p>Therefore, speaking only from an artistic point of view, I
    tell you that in my opinion you as a Dutchman will feel most at
    home in the Dutch intellectual climate, and will get more
    satisfaction from working after the character of this country
    (whether it be figure or landscape) than by concentrating on
    and specializing in the nude.</p>

    <p>Although I like Baudry and others, such as Lefebvre and
    Henner, too - I greatly prefer Jules Breton, Feyen-Perrin,
    Millet, Ulysse Butin, Mauve, Artz, Isra&euml;ls, etc., etc.</p>

    <p>And I am speaking in this way because I am positive that
    fundamentally this is your opinion too. And though you have
    seen a lot, it is certain that I at least have not seen less
    than you of different kinds of art. Particularly seeing that I,
    though loosely speaking only a beginner in the art of drawing,
    am a pretty good judge of art in general, you should not take
    my opinion too lightly the few times I give it. And as I see
    it, both you and I cannot do better than work after nature in
    Holland (figure and landscape). Then we are ourselves, then we
    feel at home, then we are in our element. The more we know of
    what is happening abroad, the better, but we must never forget
    that we have our roots in the Dutch soil.</p>

    <p>If I am not mistaken, you have made good progress with your
    work for Mr. Lantsheer; at least I am pleased to hear that he
    spoke that way about your picture at Arti. He has a clear eye
    for art, and there are not many who have so much knowledge and
    good taste.</p>
