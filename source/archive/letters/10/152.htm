  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I was very pleased to get your letter just now, and as I
    intended to write to you anyhow in the next day or so, I am
    replying right away.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">I'm so glad you've sent the Ingres paper. I've still got
    some left, but not the right colour.</label></p>

    <p>I was happy to hear what Mr. Tersteeg said about my
    drawings, and certainly no less glad that you saw progress
    yourself in the sketches I sent you. If it is indeed so, I mean
    to work to such an effect that neither you nor Mr. T. will have
    any reason to take back your more favourable opinions. I shall
    do my very best not to let you down.</p>

    <p>The artist always comes up against resistance from nature in
    the beginning, but if he really takes her seriously he will not
    be put off by that opposition, on the contrary, it is all the
    more incentive to win her over - at heart, nature and the
    honest draughtsman are as one. (Nature is most certainly
    &ldquo;intangible,&rdquo; yet one must come to grips with her
    and do so with a firm hand.) And having wrestled and struggled
    with nature for some time now, I find her more yielding and
    submissive, not that I have got there yet, no one is further
    from thinking that than I am, but things are beginning to come
    more easily.</p>

    <p>The struggle with nature is sometimes a bit like what
    Shakespeare calls &ldquo;the taming of the shrew&rdquo; (which
    means wearing down the opposition, bon gr&eacute; et mal
    gr&eacute; [willy-nilly]). In many fields, but especially in
    drawing, I think that &ldquo;serrer de pr&egrave;s vaut mieux
    que l&acirc;cher&rdquo; [persistence is better than
    surrender].</p>

    <p>I have come to feel more and more that figure drawing is an
    especially good thing to do, and that indirectly it also has a
    good effect on landscape drawing. If one draws a pollard willow
    as if it were a living being, which after all is what it really
    is, then the surroundings follow almost by themselves, provided
    only that one has focused all one's attention on that
    particular tree and not rested until there was some life in
    it.</p>

    <p>Enclosed are a few small sketches. I'm doing quite a bit of
    work on the Leurs road these days. <art id=866>Working with watercolour and
    sepia</art> now and then too, but that isn't coming off too well
    yet.</p>

    <p>Mauve has gone to Drenthe. We've agreed that I'll go and see
    him there as soon as he writes, but perhaps he'll come and
    spend a day at Prinsenhage first.</p>

    <p>I went to see the Fabritius in Rotterdam on my last trip,
    and I'm glad you had a chance to see that Mesdag drawing among
    other things. If the drawing by Mrs. Mesdag you mention is of
    yellow roses on a mossy ground, then I saw it at the exhibition
    and it is indeed very beautiful and artistic.</p>

    <p>What you say about De Bock is, I think, true in every
    respect. I take the same view of him, but could not have put it
    as well as you did in your letter. If he could and wanted to
    concentrate, he would certainly be a better artist than he is.
    I told him straight out, &ldquo;De Bock, if you and I were to
    apply ourselves to figure drawing for a year, then we would
    both end up quite different from what we are now, but if we do
    not apply ourselves and simply carry on without learning
    anything new, then we won't even stay as we are but will lose
    ground. If we don't draw figures, or trees as if they were
    figures, then we have no backbone, or rather one that's too
    weak. Could Millet and Corot, of whom we both think so much,
    draw figures, or couldn't they? I think those Masters tackled
    just about anything.&rdquo; And he agreed with me about this,
    in part at least.</p>

    <p>In fact, I think he's been working very hard on the
    Panorama, and even though he refuses to admit it, that too will
    have a generally favourable effect on him.</p>

    <p>He told me a very funny thing about the Panorama, which made
    me feel very warmly toward him. You know the painter
    Destre&eacute;? He went up to De Bock with a very superior air,
    and said to him, with great disdain, of course, yet in an
    unctuous and insufferably patronizing way, &ldquo;De Bock, they
    asked me to paint that Panorama, too, but seeing it was lacking
    in any artistic worth I felt I simply had to refuse.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>To which De Bock retorted: &ldquo;Mr. Destre&eacute;, which
    is easier, painting a Panorama, or refusing to paint one? Which
    is more artistic, doing it or not doing it?&rdquo; I'm not sure
    if those were his precise words, but that was certainly the
    gist of it, and I thought it straight and to the point.</p>

    <p>And I respect it as much as I respect your way of dealing
    with the older and wiser members of your society, whom you have
    left to their own old age and wisdom while you yourself have
    got on with things in your younger and more energetic way. That
    is true philosophy and makes us act as De Bock and you do when
    the need arises; it can be said of such philosophy that it is
    practical as well, in the same way as Mauve says,
    &ldquo;Painting is drawing as well.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I've filled up my paper, so I shall end and go out for a
    walk. My warmest thanks for all your efforts on my behalf, a
    handshake in my thoughts, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
