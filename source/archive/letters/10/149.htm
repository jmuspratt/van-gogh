  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just come back from a trip to The Hague. I am home
    alone tonight, as Father and Mother are still at Prinsenhage. So
    it is a good opportunity to tell you about everything.</p>

    <p>I left here Tuesday, and now it is Friday night.</p>

    <p>At The Hague I went to see Mr. Tersteeg, Mauve and De Bock.
    Mr. Tersteeg was very kind, and said he thought I had made
    progress. As I had again copied the whole series of Exercices
    au Fusain, 1 - 60, I brought them with me, and it was
    especially in reference to them that he made the remark; he at
    least attaches some value to my making them, also to my
    occasionally copying a figure by Millet, Boughton or others,
    which most people do not approve of at all.</p>

    <p>So then I got some satisfaction from that work, too.</p>

    <p>I spent an afternoon and part of an evening with Mauve, and
    saw many beautiful things in his studio. My own drawings seemed
    to interest Mauve more. He gave me a great many hints which I
    was glad to get, and I have arranged to come back to see him in
    a relatively short time when I have some new studies. He showed
    me a whole lot of his studies and explained them to me - not
    sketches for drawings or pictures, but real studies, things
    that seemed of little importance. He thinks I should start
    painting now.</p>

    <p>I enjoyed meeting De Bock; I was at his studio. He is
    painting a large picture of the dunes which has much that is
    fine in it. But in my opinion the fellow must practice drawing
    figures in order to produce even finer things. It seems to me
    he has a real artist's temperament and that we have not heard
    the last of him. He raves about Millet and Corot, but didn't
    these two work hard on figures - yes or no? Corot's figures
    aren't so well known as his landscapes, but it cannot be denied
    that he has done them. Besides, Corot drew and modelled every
    tree trunk with the same devotion and love as if it were a
    figure. And a tree by Corot is something quite different from
    one by De Bock. One of the best things I saw of De Bock's was a
    copy of a Corot. It's unlikely that it would be taken for an
    original, but it was very seriously done - more seriously than
    many a false Corot less noticeably different from the real
    thing.</p>

    <p>Then I went to see Mesdag's Panorama with him; it is a work
    that deserves all respect. It reminded me of a remark, I think
    by Burger (or Thor&eacute;) about <art id=anatless>The Anatomy Lesson by
    Rembrandt:</art> le seul d&eacute;faut de ce tableau est de ne pas
    avoir de d&eacute;faut. [This picture's only fault is that it
    has no fault.] The three drawings by Mesdag at the exhibition
    had perhaps more faults, but aroused immediate sympathy, at
    least it was so with me.</p>

    <p>Speaking of the exhibition, there was a splendid drawing by
    Isra&euml;ls, &ldquo;Sewing Class at Katwijk&rdquo;; Mauve,
    &ldquo;A Plough&rdquo; - splendid - &ldquo;Sheep in the
    Dunes,&rdquo; and then a single figure - a labourer resting in
    the field at twilight. Artz had three drawings there if I
    remember correctly: a scene in an almshouse, old men and women
    eating porridge - very important, very well and seriously done;
    also two studies of heads, full of character - a man and woman
    from Scheveningen. Among Weissenbruch's was a drawing of water
    lilies, so simple, so full of style, of understanding and love,
    that many drawings by others were lost beside it. But this
    exhibition shows clearly that there are many clever landscape
    painters among the younger artists.</p>

    <p>Including Duch&acirc;tel [Du Chattel] and Neuhuys. Albert
    Neuhuys had a large figure drawing which was splendid, a girl
    and two children.</p>

    <p>Clara Montalba's work was new to me. Hers is a peculiar
    talent - in some respects it reminds me of Rochussen.</p>

    <p>At Mr. Tersteeg's I also saw many fine things by Valkenburg,
    Neuhuys, etc., etc. J. Maris had beautiful things at the
    exhibition, for instance, two little girls in white at a piano
    and a mill in the snow. I met Willem Maris at De Bock's. What a
    beautiful sketch the latter has by him, a road in winter with a
    little figure under an umbrella.</p>

    <p>By chance Bosboom saw my studies and gave me some hints
    about them. I only wish I had more opportunity to receive such
    hints. Bosboom is one of those people who has the ability to
    impart knowledge to others and make things clear to them. There
    were three or four good drawings of his at the exhibition.</p>

    <p>I stayed in The Hague until Thursday morning, then I went to
    Dordrecht because from the train I had seen a spot I wanted to
    draw - <art id=850>a row of windmills</art>. Though it was raining, I managed to
    finish it, and so at least I have a souvenir from my little
    trip.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">At Stam's I found Ingres paper twice as thick as the
    ordinary kind, one can work better on it. But alas, it's white.
    Would there be any chance of your sending some of that same
    kind, but the colour of unbleached muslin or linen? Like a few
    of the sheets that were in that lot you bought me before, and
    like those on which the Exercices au Fusain are printed. Before
    beginning to draw on the white paper, one must first wash the
    whole page with a flat tone.</label></p>

    <p>So I have been to The Hague; perhaps it was the beginning of
    a renewed and closer acquaintance with Mauve and others. I hope
    so. A handshake in thought; my warm thanks for your faithful
    help in this matter - because of the expenses perhaps I never
    would have gone, or at least postponed it.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>De Bock was very pleased with the drawings by Millet which
    he bought from you.</p>
