  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I enclose a little note because the others are writing to
    you and I thought you would like to hear what I am actually
    doing.</p>

    <p>Every day that it does not rain, I go out in the fields,
    generally to the heath. I make my studies on a rather large
    scale, like the few you saw at the time of your visit; so I
    have done, among other things, a <art id=875>cottage on the heath</art>,
    and also that <art id=842>barn with a thatched roof</art> on the road to
    Roozendaal, which locally they call the Protestant barn.</p>

    <p>You will perhaps remember what I mean.</p>

    <p>Then <art id=843>the mill right opposite it</art>, in the meadow,
    and the elm trees in the churchyard.</p>

    <p>And another of woodcutters, busy on a wide patch of ground
    where a large pine tree has been cut down. I also try to draw
    the implements, such as a wagon, plough, harrow, wheelbarrow,
    etc., etc.</p>

    <p>The one with the woodcutters turned out best of all, and I
    think you would like it.</p>

    <p>I have had a letter from Rappard; perhaps he will come here
    some time this summer.</p>

    <p>A handshake in thought, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
  </body>
