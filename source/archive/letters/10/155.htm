  <body>
    <p>Old boy,</p>

    <p>I cannot make out from the letter Father and Mother received
    today what you think of my last two letters. But since you did
    not mention their receipt or enclose a letter for me, I suppose
    I shall soon get one from you. And in this case I think it much
    better if you write after reading my two - or including this
    one, my three - letters which, though written singly,
    complement each other, than if you had immediately answered the
    first one only. How cold and harsh my first letter must have
    sounded, and I suppose you must have thought me very obstinate
    and obdurate then. But was I wrong in this, and you will
    reproach me for not laying before you my most intimate and
    tender feelings - since you, oh man of business, would have
    received them during your daily fever of affairs, when not
    exactly in the mood to appreciate love stories? So I thought,
    No, first we must awaken him, and only then sow the seeds of
    soft words in him. We must first prepare the soil for that man
    who &ldquo;hammers away at business.&rdquo; Therefore, the
    first letter was as cold as a ploughshare. But as to the
    second, was I wrong in asserting that it would be more serious
    and more intimate? And now that we are speaking more
    intimately, we shall continue to.</p>

    <p>But &ldquo;in the meantime,&rdquo; just another little bit
    of the ploughshare. Here it comes&hellip; Though you have gone
    pretty far in the world without a &ldquo;she, and no
    other,&rdquo; though you stand firmly in your shoes without a
    she, and no other, though you know how to bring off business
    deals without a she, and no other, though you are a man of will
    power, energy and character without a she, and no other, though
    you have knowledge of men and experience without a she, and no
    other, though you have high spirits, buoyancy and courage
    without a she, and no other, though you dare to take sides and
    hate halting between two opinions without&hellip;</p>

    <p><i>Yet</i> you will get further in the world, stand more
    firmly in your shoes, be a man of more will power, energy and
    character, obtain more knowledge of men and experience, have
    higher spirits, more buoyancy and courage, take sides more
    decidedly, be more averse to halting between two opinions, to
    wavering, oscillating, etc., than you have until now as soon as
    you have somebody, to whom &ldquo;she, and no other&rdquo;
    <i>then</i> applies. In short, you will be more yourself with
    an honestly meant and deeply felt &ldquo;she, and no
    other&rdquo; than <i>without</i> the same.</p>

    <p>This little bit of the ploughshare is still going on - don't
    get cross at it.</p>

    <p>Your letter to Father was rather melancholy and, to tell you
    the truth, I did not understand it and did not know what to
    make of it. Is there anything serious, yes or no? And some
    expressions astonished me, first, because it was you who used
    them and, second, because you wrote them to Father and
    Mother.</p>

    <p>For you, more than anyone else, keep all your &ldquo;grandes
    et petites mis&egrave;res de la vie humaine&rdquo; to yourself;
    and <i>if</i> you did speak about them, it would be to those
    whom you knew to be strong in the things in which you might
    feel more or less weak. I believe that if you felt yourself
    weak in anything, you would only confess that weakness to
    someone whom you knew would be able to cure you of it. Besides,
    only this summer you told me yourself that you thought it
    better not to speak about the difficulties in life, but to keep
    them to yourself in order not to lose your buoyancy, as you put
    it. I thought this a very impressive resolve, though, indeed, I
    was far from sympathizing with it; I know only too well that my
    need for sympathy has often induced me to seek it from people
    who, instead of strengthening, unnerved me.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">Father and Mother are very good at heart, but have little
    understanding of our inner feelings, and as little
    comprehension of your real circumstances as of mine. They love
    us with all their hearts - you especially - and we both, I as
    well as you, love them very much indeed; but alas, in many
    cases they cannot give us practical advice, and there are times
    when, with the best of intentions, they do not understand us.
    It is not their fault, but the difference in age and the
    difference in opinion and the difference in
    circumstances&hellip; But that our home is and will remain our
    resting place come what may, and that we must appreciate it and
    on our side respect that home, there I quite agree with you -
    though perhaps you did not expect such a candid declaration
    from me.</label></p>

    <p>However, there is a resting place better, more necessary,
    more indispensable than our home with our parents, however
    good, however necessary, however indispensable it may be - and
    that is our own hearth and home, with our respective
    &ldquo;she, and no other.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There you are, oh man of business, closing profitable deals,
    your biggest deal - your own home with your own &ldquo;she, and
    no other.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In my opinion this is the point you would do well to bear in
    mind, the stimulant which more than any other
    &rdquo;tonic&rdquo; will keep alive your courage, strength,
    energy and love of life, and renew them more and more every
    day. Some expressions in your letter of today induce me to say
    now, Suppose there might be some special reason why you should
    be more than ever on the qui vive, and act more energetically
    and intelligently, suppose they try to undermine your position,
    or there is some other trouble or moment of danger. Do not
    forget you are twenty-six, and in &ldquo;la saison du
    renouveau&rdquo; [the season of renewal]. Close the biggest
    deal of your life! Renew yourself radically by being
    principally on the <i>qui vive</i> in that you look at girls
    more seriously and attentively, and be very careful to find out
    if <i>your</i> &ldquo;she, and no other&rdquo; is not among
    them.</p>

    <p>This is the end of the ploughshare.</p>

    <p>You remember perhaps that this summer we spoke about women,
    both with a kind of desolation. That we felt, or thought we
    felt, &ldquo;La femme est la d&eacute;solation du
    juste.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And - and - I felt, perhaps you did too, rather like
    Monsieur le Juste above - I am not able to decide whether this
    saying is true or untrue, because since this summer I have
    begun to doubt, if I ever knew distinctly, &ldquo;qu'est-ce que
    c'est qu'une femme, et qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un
    juste?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And I have resolved to examine these two problems, the
    result being that I often say to myself, Tu ne sais pas encore
    ce que c'est qu'une femme. Tu ne sais pas encore ce qu'est
    qu'une juste, si non toutefois que tu n'en es pas encore
    un&rdquo; [You don't yet know what a woman is. You don't yet
    know what a just man is, except that you aren't one yet for
    sure].</p>

    <p>All of which is quite different from my opinion of this
    summer. Not I, but Father Michelet says to all young men like
    you and me:</p>

    <p>Il faut qu'une femme souffle sur toi pour que tu sois homme.
    Elle a souffl&eacute; sur moi, mon cher!</p>

    <p>Faut-il de m&ecirc;me et par rencontre qu'un homme souffle
    sur une femme pour qu'elle soit femme?</p>

    <p>Je le pense tr&egrave;s certainement.</p>

    <p>[A woman must breathe on you for you to be a man. She has
    breathed on me, dear chap!</p>

    <p>On the other hand, must a man breathe on a woman for her to
    be a woman?</p>

    <p>I most certainly think so.]</p>

    <p>So, man of business, there is a love story for you! Do you
    think it very dull and very sentimental? When I had firmly
    resolved not to leave her, even if it should arouse her
    displeasure at first, not to turn away from her, when I clung
    only to that &ldquo;she, and no other&rdquo; and &ldquo;aimer
    encore&rdquo; then I felt a certain calm and firmness come over
    me.</p>

    <p>Then my melancholy left me, then all things became new for
    me, then also my energy increased.</p>

    <p>I know there are persons who think I ought to resign myself,
    and that it is against the rules not to consider myself beaten;
    but if they say of my proposal this summer, &ldquo;If you sing
    before breakfast, you will cry before night,&rdquo; then you
    know the verse,</p>

    <p>He lost his feather in a fight</p>

    <p>But knew they'd grow again all right,</p>

    <p>Far finer than before.</p>

    <p>However, now it is one of the little miseries of human life
    for me that I cannot go to see her once in a while or write to
    her, and that some people, who might have a good influence in
    undermining that &ldquo;never, no, never,&rdquo; on the
    contrary, feed that &ldquo;never, no, never.&rdquo; I wish that
    she found no sympathy anywhere for her &ldquo;never, no,
    never&rdquo; and that everyone would join in efforts to
    bankrupt the &ldquo;never, no, never.&rdquo; That they would
    quite reduce it to a warning monument for other &ldquo;never,
    no, never&rdquo; - saying ladies and for the encouragement of
    those who say, &ldquo;Aimer encore.&rdquo; But we have not come
    that far.</p>

    <p>I should like it very much if you could persuade Father and
    Mother to be less pessimistic and to have more good courage and
    humanity, for they are awfully pessimistic, and call what I did
    this summer &ldquo;premature and indelicate&rdquo; (till I
    requested them quite firmly and definitely not to use such
    expressions any more).</p>

    <p>A word from you perhaps influences them more than anything I
    can say, and it would be so much better, for them as well as
    for me, to let me go my way quietly.</p>

    <p>They want me to stop all correspondence, for instance, with
    Uncle and Aunt; of course I cannot promise such a thing, and
    even if I did stop writing awhile, I would certainly start
    again with new vigour later.</p>

    <p><i>She</i> refuses to read my letters but - but - but the
    frost and the winter cold are <i>too</i> bitter to last very
    long.</p>

    <p>I think it much more natural and sensible that when I spoke
    to her for the first time about these things, she at once
    uttered that &ldquo;never, no, never&rdquo; so energetically.
    That very thing convinces me that there was some fatal disease,
    and I hope I have touched the core of the fatal disease of
    burying herself too much in the past; now a crisis of
    indignation follows, but the surgeon laughs up his sleeve and
    says, &ldquo;Touch&eacute;!&rdquo; This is just between
    ourselves, however, Theo - she must not know that I laughed up
    my sleeve over the result of the knife's thrust. Toward her I
    am of course more or less repentant: &ldquo;Did I hurt you? Oh,
    how brusque and rough I was! How could I be so?&rdquo; That is
    my attitude toward her. A very repentant and humble letter to
    Uncle; but still I told him, &ldquo;she, and no other.&rdquo;
    You will not betray me, brother? To act as if nothing had
    happened between us is all nonsense and humbug. None of that.
    Boy, I am so glad with my &ldquo;never, no, never,&rdquo; I
    should like to shout with glee; but I must not show it, and
    must attack her again in some other way. But how to approach
    her, how to come near her? I must do it someday quite
    unexpectedly and take her unawares. For if I do not stick with
    it, then the fatal evil of burying herself in the past will
    come back with sevenfold strength, and yet &ldquo;aimer
    encore&rdquo; is such a good thing, and worth all the efforts
    of one's soul.</p>

    <p>Now, I have been complaining a little about Father and
    Mother, but except that they do not understand the least bit of
    it and do not understand anything of the &ldquo;aimer
    encore&rdquo; and could only call it &ldquo;untimely and
    indelicate&rdquo; until I put a stop to that - after all, they
    are very good to me and kinder than ever. But I would rather
    they could understand more of my thoughts and opinions on many
    things. Theirs is a system of resignation in many matters to
    which I cannot resign myself. Now I think a letter from you,
    speaking lightly about that &ldquo;never, no, never,&rdquo;
    would perhaps be very effective. One word from Mother this
    summer would have given me the opportunity of saying many
    things to <i>her</i> which could not be said in public. But
    Mother very decidedly refused to say that word; on the
    contrary, she cut off every opportunity for me.</p>

    <p>And she came to me with a face full of pity and with many
    comforting words, and I am sure she had prayed a beautiful
    prayer for me, that I might receive strength for
    resignation.</p>

    <p>But until now that prayer has found no hearing; on the
    contrary, I have received strength for action.</p>

    <p>You understand that a man who wants to act cannot quite
    approve of the fact that his mother prays for his resignation.
    And that he also thinks her words of comfort a little out of
    place as long as he does not despair, but, on the contrary,
    says from the bottom of his heart, &ldquo;Je n'accepte point le
    joug du d&eacute;spoir&rdquo; [I won't accept the yoke of
    despair]. I wish she had not prayed for me, but had given me
    the chance of having an intimate conversation with <i>her</i>.
    And instead of agreeing with that &ldquo;never, no,
    never,&rdquo; she might have taken my part with a little more
    sympathy when Kee spoke to her in confidence and poured out her
    heart to her. I tell you these things to convince you that an
    energetic word from you to Father and Mother would be of great
    help to me. For it is true, is it not, brother, that we are not
    only brothers, but friends and congenial spirits?</p>

    <p>Since I really love, there is more reality in my drawings,
    and I sit writing to you now in the little room with quite a
    collection around me of men, women and children from the
    &ldquo;Heike,&rdquo; etc. Mauve is ill, but Father and Mother
    have invited him to come here to recover as soon as he can
    undertake the journey.</p>

    <p>Adieu. Write soon, a handshake in thought, believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
