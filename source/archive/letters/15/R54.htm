    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half June 1885</p>

    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I had a talk with Wenkebach today - and as you had said a
    few words to him about it and he seemed to know something about
    the affair, I spoke about it - without going into details,
    however; but I said this much, that I would gladly consider it
    a misunderstanding, but that I should never admit the justice
    of your reproaches about my work. What I am quite willing to
    admit is that often - which will be the case with most of us -
    very often, if you like - I do things wrong before I manage to
    do them better. All right.</p>

    <p>Details of your remarks are very accurate; all of it
    - <i>no</i>!</p>

    <p>In point of fact Wenkebach thought you would reverse your
    judgment. I particularly pointed out to him that, if my
    figures have changed, I have done this in order to give them
    more form and fullness, and that, when I formerly put down a
    firmer line, the result of this very thing was that the figure
    remained <i>flat</i> - something I have come to hate more and
    more.</p>

    <p>But perhaps it's just as well that this has happened, for I
    don't think there's much chance of your getting to such a point
    &ldquo;that your belief,&rdquo; as you called it, &ldquo;is
    shaken&rdquo; a second time.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.people">I have had the very same kind of trouble for a great number
    of years with a great number of people. When I protested
    against it once in a while and said that I didn't deserve it,
    things got worse and worse, and they wouldn't listen to another
    word about it. My parents and my whole family. Tersteeg, and
    along with him a lot of fellows who knew me when I was with
    Goupil &amp; Co., went so far in their disapproval of
    <i>all</i> my doings that these last years, instead of wasting
    any more time on attempts to convince them, I, who have no time
    to waste, have simply given them the cold shoulder in my turn -
    <i>and let them say, think, do whatever they like without
    minding it the least little bit</label></i>.</p>

    <p>This disagreement with you is <i>not</i> exceptional, though
    you may think so. You have let yourself be overawed by public
    opinion in this. And if you now feel this a little yourself,
    and think it over, then I repeat, it is quite a good thing that
    we have quarreled.</p>

    <p>But I am a bit obstinate in this matter, for I don't want
    this thing to go on rankling, and I don't want a
    <i>dragging</i> friendship.</p>

    <p><i>Either</i> cordial and sincere <i>or</i> finished.</p>

    <p>So this is my last word: I want you to take back, frankly
    and without reservation, what you wrote in your last letters -
    beginning with the one I sent back to you.</p>

    <p>This is not only to my interest, but also to yours, for by
    doing so you will erase an action which, though it may be
    understandable, was not quite manly. By doing so you will erase
    a misunderstanding which you cannot stick to in good faith, and
    your continuing to cling to it would be obdurate spitefulness;
    so, on the condition that you withdraw those letters
    unreservedly, we'll renew our friendship, which may well become
    firmer and better as a result of this quarrel.</p>

    <p>Please reply to this.</p>

    <p>As regards my family - on the occasion of my father's death,
    realizing that my difference of opinion with him would probably
    have been perpetual, I simply said - for the sake of clarity -
    that my views about <i>practical matters</i> and my way of life
    differed too much from theirs to enable us to come to a lasting
    agreement. That I absolutely insisted on behaving according to
    my own views, however strictly on my own. And that I
    relinquished my share in the inheritance; inasmuch as during
    the last years I had lived in great discord with my father, I
    felt I did not have a right to anything that was his, and for
    that matter I did not covet it. You will agree with me that
    this puts a definite stop to all disagreements with my family.
    So there is an <i>end</i> of them, and otherwise I am on quite
    good terms with those at home. If I took such vigorous measures
    in one matter, then please remember that, however gladly I
    shall make up with you, I am very far from admitting the
    justice of your grievances, and my condition remains:
    withdrawal of your letters without reservation, for though some
    of the details in them are right, I don't deserve their general
    contents.</p>

    <p>Greetings.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
