    <p>[First letter after the sudden death of their Father.]</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I felt the same as you did when you wrote that you could not
    work as usual the first days; it was the same with me.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.death">Indeed, those were days we shall not easily forget. And yet
    the total impression was not terrible, only solemn. Life is not
    long for anybody, and the problem is only to make something of
    it.</label></p>

    <p>Today I painted better again; the first two heads turned out
    badly, <art id=0160>today's is a young girl's, almost a child's head. As to
    colour, it is a contrast of bright red with pale green against
    the flesh colour of the little face, there is already a head
    like it among those you took with you</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">I should like to hear whether those rolled-up things arrived
    safely. If I thought that C. M. was in earnest when he asked
    for children's heads, I might send him the one I did today,
    but&hellip;I can't say I feel much inclination to enter into
    correspondence with him unless he asks for something more
    definitely. But the fact he was in the studio can do no
    harm.</label></p>

    <p>I should not mind beginning another still life of those
    honesties and dry leaves against blue, because he also said
    something about that.</p>

    <p>Of course I intend to go on working hard, but it is
    absolutely necessary for me to settle my colour bill as soon as
    possible. Every year about this time I have been able to pay
    off the bill and buy some new painting materials. And this year
    I have painted so much during the last months that I really
    need them more than ever.</p>

    <p>I did not want to talk much about it or contradict you much
    when you were here, but when you said that I should change
    someday and that I should not always stay here, any more than
    Mauve had always stayed in Bloemendaal, it may be true, but I
    personally see no good in moving, because I have a good studio
    here and the scenery is very beautiful.</p>

    <p>Don't forget I am positively convinced that a painter of
    rural life can do no better than take Barbizon as an
    example.</p>

    <p>To dwell and to live in the very midst of what one paints,
    for in the country nature has a new and different aspect every
    day.</p>

    <p>In short, the two reasons for living in the country are:
    that one can work more there and that one has less
    expenses.</p>

    <p>There are, let's say, some three months between now and the
    time you come again this summer.</p>

    <p>If I work hard every day, by that time I can have another
    twenty studies for you, besides twenty more to take with you to
    Antwerp one day if you like.</p>

    <p>But it is absolutely necessary that I pay my colour bill as
    soon as possible. You know that I didn't say a single word to
    you about it either in February or in March. But they have not
    been easy months for me, I can tell you.</p>

    <p>The weather has gotten colder here again. As soon as we have a
    few fine days, I shall try to make a sketch of the churchyard.
    The head I painted today is, I think, as good as the one with
    the big white cap you have; it is somewhat like this sketch,
    and might serve as a pendant to it.</p>

    <p>[Here Vincent <art id=478_V-T_3970>sketched two heads</art>.]

    <p>If you mounted these two on gilt Bristol, they would perhaps
    look well in gold, better than without it.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake, and still thinking often of your
    visit,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
