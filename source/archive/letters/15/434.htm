  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I will tell you what Doctor Van der Loo said about Mother in
    a few words.</p>

    <p>He says:</p>

    <p>1. that there is nothing the matter with her;</p>

    <p>2. that she may live another ten years or so;
    <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>3. that she would have to contract some disease or other to
    die earlier.</p>

    <p>And finally he seems to think it quite natural that at times
    she should be a little bit dazed, but he did not attach much
    importance to it.</p>

    <p>So she can do whatever she likes, and does not need to be
    very careful in the matter of making trips or moving.</p>

    <p>So much the better in any case. At any rate it is
    reassuring. For, speaking for myself, I believe what he says,
    and taking into consideration the excellent care Wil takes of
    Mother, there is not much chance of her contracting a
    disease.</p>

    <p>I wanted to inform you of this promptly. It sets my mind at
    rest too.</p>

    <p>I must say I am longing for Antwerp now. Probably the first
    thing I shall do there will be to go and see the pictures by
    Leys in his <i>dining hall</i>, if it is open to the public.
    You know that &ldquo;Walk on the Ramparts,&rdquo; and those
    which Bracquemond etched, &ldquo;The Table&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;The Servant Maid.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I imagine it will be beautiful there this winter, especially
    the docks with snow.</p>

    <p>Of course I shall take a few pictures with me, and they will
    be those that I would otherwise have sent to you one of these
    days.</p>

    <p>A big mill on the heath in the evening, and a view of the
    village behind a row of poplars with yellow leaves, a still
    life, and a number of drawings of figures.</p>

    <p>At present I am rather in a fix with my work here. It is
    freezing hard, so working out-of-doors is impossible. It is
    better to take no models at all as long as I live in this
    house, at least until I come back. Then I save my colours and
    canvas so as to have ammunition there. <i>So the sooner I can
    go, the better</i>.</p>

    <p>The other day I had a letter from Leurs about my pictures.
    He wrote that Tersteeg and Wisselingh had seen them, but did
    not care for them.</p>

    <p>All the same I maintain that I shall bring people to have
    other ideas, although Tersteeg and Wisselingh may be
    indifferent. I have just read a few books in the style of the
    Souvenirs of Gigoux, which my friend in Eindhoven had ordered,
    and in which I found very interesting things about the men of
    that period, beginning with Paul Huet. And which encourage me
    to think that I have not attacked nature in the wrong way, nor
    the technique of painting, though I readily admit that I shall
    and must change a lot more. As to the heads which I sent you,
    there must be some good ones among them. I am almost sure of
    it. So let's go on quietly.</p>

    <p>I don't think this winter will be tedious. Of course it will
    be especially a question of hard work. But there is something
    curious in the very feeling that one has to enter the fight. <label content="art.materials">I
    am taking a good supply with me of the colours that I can get
    brayed here myself, but it will certainly be a good thing if I
    can get some colours of a better quality there.</p>

    <p>I am also taking along at least forty small stretchers, of
    the size of those study heads which you have. And drawing
    material and paper, so that whatever happens, I shall always
    have something to do.</label></p>

    <p>As I have been working absolutely alone for years, I imagine
    that, though I want to and can learn from others, and even
    adopt some technical things, I shall always see with my <i>own
    eyes</i>, and render things originally. However, it is quite
    certain that I shall try to learn some more. And, if possible,
    especially the nude. But I am afraid I shall not succeed in
    getting good models, as <i>many as I like</i> and good ones,
    but shall have to find the money for it by making other things,
    either landscapes or city views or portraits, as I said, or
    even signboards and decorations. Or, what I did not mention in
    my previous letter among the &ldquo;jobs on the side&rdquo;
    that would be possible, by giving painting lessons, letting
    them begin by painting still life, which I think is a different
    method from that of the drawing masters. I have tried it on
    those acquaintances of mine in Eindhoven, and I should dare to
    repeat it.</p>

    <p>I shall certainly leave immediately, as soon as I get the
    monthly allowance from you. And if you should by chance be able
    to send it a week earlier, I would also start a week earlier.
    But of course I do not count on this. I am glad I have now been
    to see the Amsterdam museum, for since then I have noticed that
    what I saw there has been useful in my work.</p>

    <p>Write soon if you have time. As I am busy packing my things,
    my thoughts are of course more there than here.</p>

    <p>I painted continuously here <i>to learn painting</i>, to get
    firm notions about colour, etc., without having much room in my
    head for other things.</p>

    <p>But when I got off to Amsterdam for a few days, I enjoyed
    seeing pictures again immensely.</p>

    <p>For sometimes it is damned hard to stand completely outside
    the world of painters and pictures, and to have no contact with
    others. Since then I have felt the longing to go back to them,
    at least for a time. Having been entirely out of it for a few
    years and having wrestled with nature sometimes helps, and one
    may get a new store of courage and also of health by it, of
    which one can never have too much, for a painter's life is
    often hard enough.</p>

    <p>As to my work, I shall have to act according to
    circumstances. I mean, if I can get in touch with an art
    dealer, I must try and get him to show some things of mine. But
    all is not lost that is delayed, and especially if I may
    succeed in making new studies of heads or figures, I will soon
    show you some of them.</p>

    <p><art id=0045>The one landscape I am taking with me, and if possible both,
    but the one with the yellow leaves,</art> I believe you would like
    too. I am enclosing a hasty scratch of it.</p>

    <p>The horizon is a dark streak against a light streak of sky
    in white and blue. In that dark streak, little patches of red,
    bluish and green, or brown, forming the silhouette of the roofs
    and orchards, the field greenish. The sky higher up, gray, with
    the black saplings and yellow leaves against it. The foreground
    all covered with yellow leaves, in which are two little black
    figures and a blue one. To the right, a birch trunk, white and
    black, and a green trunk with red-brown leaves.</p>

    <p>Good-by. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
