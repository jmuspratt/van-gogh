  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>My warmest good wishes for good health and peace of mind on
    your birthday. I should have liked to send <art id=0078>the painting of the
    Potato Eaters for this day, but although it's coming along
    well, it isn't quite finished yet</art>.</p>

    <p>Though the actual painting will have been completed in a
    comparatively short time, and largely from memory, it has taken
    a whole winter of painting studies of heads and hands.</p>

    <p>And as for the few days in which I have painted it now -
    it's been a tremendous battle, but one for which I was filled
    with great enthusiasm. Even though at times I was afraid it
    would never come off. But painting, too, is
    &ldquo;agir-cr&eacute;er.&rdquo; [acting-creating.]</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">When weavers weave that cloth which I think they call
    cheviot, or those curious multicoloured Scottish tartan
    fabrics, then they try, as you know, to get strange broken
    colours and greys into the cheviot - and to get the most vivid
    colours to balance each other in the multicoloured chequered
    cloth - so that instead of the fabric being a jumble, the
    <i>effet produit</i> [overall effect] of the pattern looks
    harmonious from a distance.</p>

    <p>A grey woven from red, blue, yellow, off-white and black
    threads - a blue broken by a green and an orange, red or yellow
    thread - are quite unlike <i>plain</i> colours, that is, they
    are more vibrant, and primary colours seem <i>hard</i>, cold
    and <i>lifeless</i> beside them.</p>

    <p>Yet the weaver, or rather the designer, of the pattern or
    the colour combination does not always find it easy to make an
    exact estimate of the number of threads and their direction -
    no more than it is easy to weave brush strokes into a
    harmonious whole.</label></p>

    <p>If you could see the first painted studies I did on my
    arrival here in Nuenen side by side with the canvas I am doing
    now, I think you would agree that things are livening up a bit
    as far as colour is concerned.</p>

    <p>I feel certain that you too will get involved with the
    question of colour analysis one day. For as an art connoisseur
    and critic, it seems to me, one must also <i>be sure</i> of
    one's ground and have firm <i>convictions</i> - for one's own
    pleasure at least, and in order to <i>substantiate one's
    opinion</i>. And one should also be able to explain it in a few
    words to others who sometimes turn to someone like yourself for
    information when they want to know a little more about art.</p>

    <p>But now I have something to say about Portier. Of course I
    am not wholly indifferent to his private opinion and I also
    appreciate his saying that he does not take back anything of
    what he has said. Nor do I mind that he apparently failed to
    hang these first <i>studies</i>. But - if he wants me to send
    him a painting intended for him, <i>then he can only have it on
    condition that he shows it</i>.</p>

    <p>As for the Potato Eaters - it is a painting <i>that will do
    well in gold</i> - of that I am <i>certain</i>. But it would do
    just as well on a wall papered in a deep shade of ripe corn.
    However, it simply <i>mustn't be seen</i> without being <i>set
    off</i> in this way. It will <i>not</i> appear to full
    advantage against a <i>dark</i> background and especially not
    against a <i>dull</i> background. And that is because it is a
    glimpse into a very grey interior. In <i>real life</i> it is
    also set in a gold frame, as it were, because the hearth and
    the light from the fire on the white walls would be nearer the
    spectator - they are situated outside the painting, but in its
    natural state the whole thing is projected backwards.</p>

    <p>Once again, it must be <i>set off</i> by putting something
    coloured a deep gold or copper round it. Please bear that in
    mind if you want to see it as it should be seen. Associating it
    with a gold tone lends brightness to <i>areas where you would
    least expect it</i>, and at the same time does away with the
    <i>marbled</i> aspect it assumes if it is unfortunately placed
    against a dull or black background. The shadows are painted
    with blue and the gold colour sets this off.</p>

    <p>Yesterday, I took it to a friend of mine in Eindhoven who is
    doing some painting. In about 3 day's time I'll go back over
    there and give it some egg-white and finish off a few
    details.</p>

    <p>This man, who is trying very hard himself to learn how to
    paint and to handle colour, was particularly taken with it. He
    had already seen the study on which I had based the lithograph
    and said that he would never have believed I could improve the
    colour and the drawing to such an extent. As he, too, paints
    from the model, he is well aware of what there is to a
    peasant's head or fist, and as for the hands, he said that he
    now had a quite different understanding of how to do them.</p>

    <p><art id=0082>The point is that I've tried to bring out the idea that
    these people eating potatoes by the light of their lamp have
    dug the earth with the self-same hands they are now putting
    into the dish, and it thus suggests <i>manual labour</i> and -
    a meal honestly <i>earned</i></art>. I wanted to convey a picture of
    a way of life quite different from ours, from that of civilized
    people. So the last thing I would want is for people to admire
    or approve of it without knowing why.</p>

    <p>I've held the threads of this fabric in my hands all winter
    long and searched for the definitive pattern - and although it
    is now a fabric of rough and coarse appearance, the threads
    have none the less been chosen with care and according to
    certain rules. And it might just turn out to be a <i>genuine
    peasant painting</i>. <i>I know that it is</i>. But anyone who
    prefers to have his peasants looking namby-pamby had best suit
    himself. Personally, I am convinced that in the long run one
    gets better results from painting them in all their coarseness
    than from introducing a conventional sweetness.</p>

    <p>A peasant girl, in her patched and dusty blue skirt and
    bodice which have acquired the most delicate shades from the
    weather, wind and sun, is better looking - in my opinion - than
    a lady. But if she dons a lady's clothes, then her authenticity
    is gone. A peasant in his fustian clothes out in the fields
    [is] better looking than when he goes to church on Sunday in a
    kind of gentleman's coat.</p>

    <p>And similarly, in my opinion, it would be wrong to give a
    painting of peasant life a conventional polish. If a peasant
    painting smells of bacon, smoke, potato steam, fine - that's
    not unhealthy - if a stable reeks of manure - all right, that's
    what a stable is all about - if a field has the smell of ripe
    corn or potatoes or of guano and manure - that's properly
    healthy, especially for city dwellers. Such pictures might
    prove <i>helpful to them</i>. But a painting of peasant life
    should not be perfumed.</p>

    <p>I am eager to know whether you will find something in it to
    please you - I hope so.</p>

    <p>I'm glad that just as Mr. Portier has said that he'll handle
    my work, I've got something more important for him than
    studies. As for Durand Ruel - though he didn't consider the
    drawings worth bothering with, do show him this painting. Let
    him think it ugly, I don't mind - but let him have a look at it
    all the same, let people see that we put some effort into our
    endeavours. No doubt you'll hear &ldquo;quell
    cro&ucirc;te!&rdquo; [what a daub!] Be prepared for that, as I
    am prepared myself. Yet we must go on providing something
    <i>genuine</i> and <i>honest</i>.</p>

    <p>Painting peasant life is a serious business, and I for one
    would blame myself if I didn't try to make pictures that give
    rise to serious reflection in those who think seriously about
    art and life.</p>

    <p>Millet, De Groux, so many others, have set an example of
    <i>character</i> by turning a deaf ear to such taunts as
    &ldquo;sale, grossier, boueux, puant&rdquo; [nasty, crude,
    filthy, stinking], etc., etc., so it would be a disgrace should
    one so much as waver. No, one must paint peasants as if one
    were one of them, as if one felt and thought as they do. Being
    unable to help what one actually is. I very often think that
    peasants are a world apart, in many respects one so much better
    than the civilized world. Not in all respects, for what do they
    know of art and many other things?</p>

    <p>I still have a few smaller studies - but you will appreciate
    that I'm being kept so busy by the larger one that I've been
    able to do little else. As soon as it is completely finished
    and dry, I shall forward you the canvas in a small packing
    case, adding a few smaller items. I think it would be as well
    not to delay the dispatch too long, which is why I'll make
    haste with it. The second lithograph of it will probably have
    to be abandoned in that case, though I realize that Mr.
    Portier, for instance, must have his opinion endorsed if we are
    to count on him once and for all as a friend. It is my sincere
    hope that we may.</p>

    <p>I have been so absorbed in the painting that I almost forgot
    that I am moving house, something that has to be attended to as
    well. My worries won't be any the less, but the lives of all
    painters in this genre have been so full of cares that I
    shouldn't want to have things any easier than they did. and
    since they managed to get their paintings done anyway, I, too,
    may be <i>held back</i> by material difficulties, but not
    <i>destroyed</i> or <i>undermined</i> by them. So there you
    are.</p>

    <p>I believe that <i>The Potato Eaters</i> will turn out well -
    as you know, the last few days are always tricky with a
    painting because before it's completely dry one can't use a
    large brush without running a real risk of spoiling it. And
    changes must be made very coolly and calmly with a small brush.
    That's why I took it to my friend and asked him to make certain
    I didn't spoil it, and why I'll be going to his place to apply
    those finishing touches.</p>

    <p>You'll certainly see that it has originality. Regards, I'm
    sorry it wasn't ready for today - best wishes once again for
    your health and peace of mind, believe me, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I'm still working on some smaller studies that will go off
    at the same time. Did you ever send that copy of the Salon
    issue?</p>
