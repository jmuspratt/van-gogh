  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your registered letter of yesterday and the
    enclosure. I am writing at once in reply and enclose <art id=1126>a small
    scratch</art>, based more closely than the one before on <art id=0078>my last
    study. I haven't been able to get as far with it as I would
    have liked. I worked on it continually for three days from
    morning till night, and by Saturday night the paint had begun
    to get into a state which prevented further work until it had
    dried out completely.</art></p>

    <p>I went to Eindhoven today to order a small lithographic
    stone, as this is to become the first of a series of
    lithographs, on which I intend to start again. When you were
    here I asked you about the costs of reproduction by the G.
    &amp; Co. process. I think you said it would be 100 francs.
    Well, the old-fashioned, almost neglected, ordinary
    lithographic process is quite a lot cheaper - especially in
    Eindhoven, perhaps. I get the use of the stone, graining, paper
    and the printing of 50 copies for <i>3 guilders</i>.</p>

    <p>Anyway, I intend to do a series of subjects from peasant
    life - <i>les paysans chez eux</i> [peasants at home].</p>

    <p>Today I went for a splendid walk for a few hours with an
    acquaintance of mine whose first watercolour of a figure I
    showed you.</p>

    <p>I don't say that the scenery isn't even more stirring and
    more dramatic, say in Brittany, in Katwijk or in the Borinage -
    yes indeed, but even so, the heath and the villages here are
    very beautiful as well, and once there, I find an inexhaustible
    source of subjects from peasant life - and the only thing that
    matters is to get down to it, to work.</p>

    <p>I've a great mind to do some watercolours and drawings again
    as well - and when I'm in my studio, I'll be able to make time
    for that in the evenings.</p>

    <p>I was tremendously pleased that you sent me the 100 francs.
    As I said, it was absolutely essential that I pay several
    things off - and that was on my mind. Not that people were
    bothering me for it, but I knew they needed the money. And that
    is why I wrote that I might have to keep something back when
    the estate is settled. But that won't be necessary now -
    although I can tell you that this year is bound to be very
    grim. But I keep thinking of what Millet said, &ldquo;Je ne
    veux point supprimer la souffrance, car souvent c'est elle, qui
    fait s'exprimer le plus &eacute;nergiquement les
    artistes.&rdquo; [I would never do away with suffering, for it
    is often what makes artists express themselves most
    forcefully.]</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">I think I'll be moving by the first of May - although I'm
    getting on well of course with Mother and our sisters, I can
    still see and sense it is pour le mieux [for the best] this way
    - since in the long run it would hardly be feasible to live
    together. Which I can put down neither to them personally nor
    to myself personally so much as to the incompatibility of the
    ideas of people who seek to maintain a certain social standing
    and a painter of peasant life who gives the matter no
    thought.</label></p>

    <p>When I say that I am a painter of peasant life, that is a
    fact, and it will become increasingly apparent to you in the
    future that I feel at ease as one. It was not for nothing that
    I spent so many evenings musing by the fire in their homes with
    the miners and the peat cutters and the weavers and the
    peasants - unless I was working too hard for that.</p>

    <p>By continually observing peasant life, at all hours of the
    day, I have become so involved in it that I rarely think of
    anything else.</p>

    <p>You write that the public attitude - that is, indifference
    to Millet's work, as you have just had occasion to observe at
    the exhibition - is not encouraging, either for artists or for
    those who have to sell paintings. I quite agree - but Millet
    himself felt and knew this - and on reading Sensier I was very
    struck by something he said at the beginning of his career,
    which I don't remember <i>word for word</i>, only the purport
    of it, namely, &ldquo;that (i.e. that indifference) would be
    bad enough if I had need of fine shoes and the life of a
    gentleman, but - puisque j'y vais en sabots - je m'en
    tirerai.&rdquo; [As I go about in clogs, I'll manage]. And so
    it turned out.</p>

    <p>What I hope never to forget is that &ldquo;il s'agit d'y
    aller en sabots&rdquo; [what matters is going about in clogs],
    that is, being content with the kind of food, drink, clothes
    and sleeping arrangements with which the peasants are
    content.</p>

    <p>That is what Millet did and indeed <i>he wanted nothing
    else</i> - and to my mind this means that he set an example to
    painters <i>as a human being</i>, which Isra&euml;ls and Mauve,
    for instance, who live rather luxurious lives, have <i>not</i>,
    and I repeat Millet is <i>father Millet</i>, that is,
    counsellor and mentor <i>in everything</i> to the younger
    painters. Most of <i>those whom I know</i>, but then I don't
    know all that many, would not subscribe to this view. For my
    part, I do, and fully believe in what he says.</p>

    <p>I'm talking at some length about this dictum of Millet's
    because you write that when <i>city-dwellers</i> paint
    peasants, their figures, <i>splendidly</i> done though they may
    be, cannot but remind one of the faubourgs [suburbs] of Paris.
    I used to have the same impression too (although in my opinion
    B. Lepage's woman digging potatoes is certainly no exception),
    but isn't this because the painters have so often failed to
    immerse themselves <i>personally</i> in peasant life? Millet
    said on another occasion, Dans l'art il faut y mettre sa peau
    [one has to put one's all into art].</p>

    <p>De Groux - that is one of his qualities - painted
    <i>peasants</i> properly. (And they, the State, demanded
    historical pictures from him! Which he also did well, but how
    much better he was when he was allowed to be <i>himself</i>.)
    It will always be a shame and disgrace that De Groux is not yet
    as fully appreciated by the Belgians as he deserves. De Groux
    is one of the <i>best Millet-like masters</i>. But although he
    neither was nor is acknowledged by the public at large, and
    although, like Daumier and Tassaert, he remains in obscurity,
    there are people, <i>Mellery</i>, for example, to name but one,
    who are working along his lines again today.</p>

    <p>I saw something recently by Mellery in an illustrated paper,
    a <i>bargee's</i> family in the little cabin of their boat -
    husband, wife, children - round a table.</p>

    <p>As far as <i>popular</i> support is concerned - years ago I
    read something on the subject in Renan which I have always
    remembered and which I shall always continue to believe - that
    anyone who wishes to accomplish something good or useful must
    not count on or seek the approval or appreciation of the
    general public, but, on the contrary, must expect only a very
    few warm hearts to sympathize and go along with him - and then
    only <i>perhaps</i>.</p>

    <p>If you come across the &ldquo;Chat noir&rdquo; people, you
    might show them this small sketch <i>to be going on with, but I
    can do a better one if they like, for this one was done in a
    great rush</i> and is simply meant to give you a clearer idea
    of the effect and the composition than the first one. Regards
    and thanks, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>You needn't tell the &ldquo;Chat noir&rdquo; that I also
    intend to make a lithograph of this subject for myself. That
    lithograph won't be for publication, anyway, but is entirely a
    private affair. For that matter, I <i>don't</i> much care if
    they don't want to have it - because I shall certainly make
    lithographs myself of whatever I want to have lithographed.</p>
