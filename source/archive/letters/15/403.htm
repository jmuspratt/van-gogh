  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I want to tell you that I am working on <art id=0078>the potato eaters,
    and I have painted new studies of the heads; the hands
    especially are greatly changed</art>.</p>

    <p>What I am trying to do most is to bring <i>life</i> into
    it.</p>

    <p>I wonder what Portier will have to say about it when it is
    finished.</p>

    <p>The Lhermittes are superb. I am quite enthusiastic about
    them.</p>

    <p>They are full of sentiment, calculated both in general and
    in detail, but especially broadly conceived and treated
    vigorously. I do hope that you will watch for the new months of
    the series being published. Tell me, please, what the best way
    to send a picture of a somewhat larger size is and which
    address it must be sent to.</p>

    <p>I will not send the potato eaters unless <i>I know for
    sure</i> there is <i>something</i> in it.</p>

    <p>But I am getting on with it, and I think there are
    completely different things in it than you can ever have seen
    in my work. At least, so distinctly.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I mean from life especially. I paint this <i>from memory on
    the picture itself</i>. But you know yourself how many times I
    have painted these heads!</p>

    <p>And then I drop in every night to correct some details on
    the spot.</p>

    <p>But in the picture I give free scope to my own head in the
    sense of thought or imagination, which is not so much the case
    in <i>studies</i>, where no creative process is allowed, but
    where one finds food for one's imagination in reality, in order
    to make it exact.</label></p>

    <p>But you know I wrote to Mr. Portier, &ldquo;Jusqu'&agrave;
    pr&eacute;sent je n'ai fait que des <i>&eacute;tudes</i>, mais
    les <i>tableaux</i> vont venir&rdquo; [Up to now I have only
    made <i>studies</i>, but the <i>paintings</i> will come]. And I
    will stick to that.</p>

    <p>I intend to send soon a few more studies from nature
    too.</p>

    <p>It is the <i>second</i> time that a saying of Delacroix's
    has meant so much to me. The first time it was his theory about
    colours, but later I read a conversation he had with other
    painters about the making, namely the <i>creation</i> of a
    picture.</p>

    <p>He pretended that the best pictures are made from memory.
    Par coeur! He said. And about that conversation I read that,
    when all those worthy people were going home in the evening,
    Delacroix, with his usual vivacity and passion, loudly called
    after them in the middle of the boulevard, Par coeur! Par
    coeur! Probably to the great astonishment of the respectable
    passers-by. Just like Jacque who, after he had spent the
    evening with a friend, kept on sending him messages by his boy,
    after midnight, and all through the night, &ldquo;J'ai encore
    par la pr&eacute;sente l'honneur de vous assurer que votre M.
    Ingres n'est qu'un imaginier, et que Daumier le surpasse
    infinitement&rdquo; [Herewith I have the honour to assure you
    once again that your Mr. Ingres is only an image maker, and
    that Daumier surpasses him infinitely], or something like
    that.</p>

    <p>I will not send the picture before I have heard from you, in
    fact it is not quite finished yet.</p>

    <p>But the most difficult things - the heads, the hands, and
    the ensemble - are finished. Perhaps you will now find in it
    what you wrote some time ago, that though it is personal, yet
    it will remind you of other painters - with a certain family
    resemblance. Which you did not find in my studies then, but I
    think if you compare my studies with the other studies, there
    would also be a resemblance.</p>

    <p>Once more thanks for the Lhermittes, and the other
    illustrations; Le Chat Noir wasn't as good as I expected,
    though the title is good. I was glad to find some particulars
    about the life of Jules Dupr&eacute; in the Vie Moderne. I
    sometimes think that perhaps Mistigris (le plus malin des
    paysagistes) in Balzac's Com&egrave;die Humaine might have been
    Dupr&eacute; in his youth. But I do not know whom Balzac meant,
    and in fact the person plays no prominent part in the book. Do
    you know who also often works in that way of draawing with
    ellipses which Gigoux mentioned? Henri Pille. &ldquo;Ne pas
    prendre par la ligne, mais par le milieu&rdquo; - is an
    important truth. Meunier, Mellery and Rappard also often draw
    in that way, and Alleb&eacute;.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
