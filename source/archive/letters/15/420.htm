  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>That colour dealer writes me that I can send him the
    pictures. But he wants me to send them as soon as possible,
    because there are many foreigners in The Hague just now. He is
    perfectly right there.</p>

    <p>Now I must beg you to try to send me enough money to have a
    box made and to pay the carriage. Deduct it from the next
    month's allowance if you like, but I haven't got a cent and I
    want to send the pictures at once.</p>

    <p>Your visit has really left me no comforting impression; more
    than ever I believe that more difficulties are threatening you
    in the coming years than you suppose.</p>

    <p>I go on insisting that it is fatal that your energy has
    manifestly taken another direction, instead of being turned to
    making a success of painting for both of us. And yet it is only
    a very short time ago that you wrote you had more confidence
    now, and that my work was good.</p>

    <p>You take it as though I were misbehaving toward you, or were
    your enemy, because at present I object to quite a number of
    things. And I am very uneasy about the future. For all that, I
    cannot speak otherwise than I did.</p>

    <p>In my opinion you don't in the least belong among the rising
    men. Resent this if you like, and in the future treat me just
    as you like because of it.</p>

    <p>I will take back my objections as soon as I see quite
    different things in you - but that I made them on the occasion
    of your visit - <i>yes</i>.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">Though you say <i>today</i>, &ldquo;I am selling to the tune
    of 500,000 fr. a year&rdquo; - this does not impress me the
    least little bit, as I am too much convinced of the difficulty
    of keeping it up for one-half, or one-fifth, and of delivering
    the goods in the years to come.</label></p>

    <p>It is too high up in the air for my taste, too little on
    solid ground. And, after all, art itself is solid enough, that
    isn't the trouble. But being a counting house is a
    <i>passing</i> thing, &ldquo;&ecirc;tre un comptoir <i>cela
    passe</i>,&rdquo; is not a phrase of my own but of somebody
    whose sayings have come terribly true.</p>

    <p>I wish you were or would become a painter.</p>

    <p>I say this straight out, more emphatically than before,
    because I really believe that the great art-dealing business is
    in many respects a speculation like the bulb trade was. And the
    situations in it, dependent on chance and freaks of
    fortune.</p>

    <p>Make a mistake in a calculation - even supposing it is only
    an insignificant slip - and what will become of the enormous
    figure of your present turnover? This figure is wholly
    dependent on a whim of Messrs. Goupil &amp; Co.'s.</p>

    <p>And <i>connoisseurship</i>, the clean aspect of it without
    <i>claptrap</i>, is more nearly related to the practice of art
    than you would be inclined to think. Dealing in pictures is
    quite different when one is entirely on one's own from doing
    business in the employ of big distributors. And the same is
    true of a lot of other things.</p>

    <p>So, in short - work hard - but at the same time try to work
    sensibly. The trouble you have taken along with me - for
    furnishing money is taking trouble too, and I don't in the
    least try to get away from it - this trouble anyway has been an
    act of personal initiative, of personal will and energy - but
    what shall I have to say and think of it if there is nothing to
    compensate for the gradual but undeniable weakening of
    financial aid?</p>

    <p>In my opinion, at least, now is just the moment to try to do
    something with my work. I have looked for addresses in Antwerp,
    too, and expect to hear more definitely from there shortly.
    Then I could probably send something there, too. But if you
    should know of anything, help me carry it through.</p>

    <p>You told me yourself, &ldquo;<i>Where there's a will there's
    a way</i>.&rdquo; Well, I am going to take you at your word a
    little, at least as to your really wanting us to make
    <i>progress</i> together.</p>

    <p>If I were to demand extravagant things and you refused -
    well, all right then - but when it is a question of the most
    urgent, the very simplest necessities of life, and it is
    increasingly and ever more badly becoming downright starvation,
    only then do I think you go too far in your economizing, and
    that in this respect it is far from useful.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>A few more words about Serret and Portier. Tell them the
    simple <i>facts</i>, namely <i>that</i> I did have some studies
    ready, but <i>that</i> I had to pay a colour dealer who was
    getting troublesome just now. <i>That</i> in order to put a
    stop to it I wrote him that his colours were invested in my
    studies, and that in consequence I requested him to do his best
    to sell something for me instead of bothering me. <i>That</i> I
    must follow this up and send him some things.</p>

    <p><i>That</i> as to the drawings I said I should show Serret,
    I need them myself, as I am in a hurry to do new things. But to
    a certain extent I attach importance to his knowing that I
    really had them when you came here, and to your telling him
    that you saw them in my house - and after that tell him exactly
    what you think.</p>

    <p>I will not influence your own opinion.</p>

    <p>However, that I feel sad at your approving of things as they
    are - yes, that is a fact.</p>

    <p>But I do not refuse to take such measures - and even if such
    a colour-selling gentleman should want to sell up my poor
    sticks, he would be welcome to fill my cup to the brim. It is
    certain that the colour-dealing gentlemen are quite capable of
    being ruthless.</p>

    <p>However, I am more than tired of talking about it - I've
    said my say - and you - you may take my hint as you think
    proper.</p>

    <p>If those fellows want to attack me, and sell me up, seeing
    that they emphatically threatened to resort to legal measures
    to collect their money, and this in a matter of less than 30
    guilders, then I shall not be able to resist them, and I shall
    let them have their way, but it will happen as it were under
    your very nose, as it is only a short while ago that you were
    here.</p>

    <p>That I am <i>unable</i> to stop working at the height I have
    risen to now, that is a fact - every day I need colours, etc.,
    I must push on, and if I want to pay for what I need today,
    yesterday's arrears will have to wait.</p>

    <p>For your further guidance, here is a survey of my
    circumstances for the remainder of the current year, precise
    and in detail.</p>

    <p>I have to pay three dealers, who are all three troublesome;
    I owe one 45 guilders; the second, 25 guilders; the third, 30
    guilders <sup>1</sup>. These amounts are exactly what remain of
    the bills - which were, of course, much bigger - incurred in
    the course of one year, and which I am paying off cash down as
    much as is possible for me with the utmost exertion.</p>

    <p>Accordingly, deficit 100 guilders</p>

    <p>Add rent for November 25 guilders</p>

    <p>-----------------</p>

    <p>125 guilders or 250 fr.</p>

    <p>Now suppose I get from you in September, October, November
    and December 4 X 150 fr. = 600 fr. Then 350 fr. remain for me
    until New Year's. <i>Add to this that for the current month I
    am left with literally nothing</i>, and that I must live during
    this month.</p>

    <p>So from August until the first of January, i.e. <i>nearly
    five months</i>, I shall have to live <i>and paint</i> on 350
    fr.</p>

    <p>Which I <i>can</i> do on 150 fr. a month, although <i>not
    comfortably</i>, but all right, it can be done by way of a
    minimum.</p>

    <p>But in the course of four months 250 fr. must be deducted
    for the payment of colours and rent; well, then my work is
    hampered and obstructed to such an extent that I am at my wit's
    end, and I prefer to tell the fellows: <i>Sell the whole lot!
    But let me work</i>!</p>

    <p><i>This</i> month I unhesitatingly threw in all I had in
    order to appease these fellows, but the cares arising from it
    are bad enough.</p>

    <p>And my last word in this matter is that if my work were
    bloodless and rotten, I should think you were right to say,
    &ldquo;<i>There is nothing I can do about it</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But now - seeing that larger and smaller painted studies as
    well as new drawings ought to make it clear to you that we are
    making progress, I am not so sure that &ldquo;there is nothing
    I can do about it&rdquo; must inevitably be your last word.</p>

    <p>Discuss it with Serret, discuss it with Portier - and tell
    them how much I should like to work on, and how small are the
    opportunities I myself have of finding buyers, as the painting
    of rustics does not take me <i>to the cities</i> but <i>to the
    countryside</i> as my field of work.</p>
