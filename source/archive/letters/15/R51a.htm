    <p>[Letter from Van Rappard to Vincent]</p>

    <p>Amice!</p>

    <p>I was greatly pleased to receive a sign of life from you,
    though the sign was not quite the one I should have liked.</p>

    <p>The news of your father's death was so unexpected that I was
    very eager to get some further information - which has not been
    forthcoming, however. As far as I can remember, the reason I
    did not see the news in the first place in the Nieuws van den
    Dag<sup>1</sup> was my careless way of reading newspapers - I
    always skip the ads. At all events I know that very, very
    shortly after receiving the formal notification I called on a
    friend who had already read it in the newspaper!</p>

    <p>Did you think that I was so little interested in your father
    or what happens in your home that an ordinary act of politeness
    would be enough to announce something as poignant as this?</p>

    <p>Then you are very much mistaken.</p>

    <p>In connection with what you sent me this time, I want to
    refer to your last letter, in which you spoke of the art of
    expressing oneself well in words. I want to point out to you
    that, however badly I may do so orally, I can do it well in
    writing, if I take sufficient pains. What I wrote you about
    your manner of working expresses exactly what I mean - although
    I did not exactly take great pains to do <i>that</i>, the only
    result is a somewhat less than beautiful style! I hoped that I
    was mistaken in my opinion of your manner of working, and I
    hope so still; but for this very reason I was deeply sorry to
    see such a complete confirmation of my opinion in what you sent
    me that I myself was terrified by it. <sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>You will agree with me that such work is not meant
    seriously. Fortunately you can do better than that, but why
    then did you see and treat everything so superficially? Why
    didn't you study the movements? Now they are only posing. How
    far from true that coquettish little hand of the woman in the
    background is - and what connection is there between the coffee
    kettle, the table and that hand that is lying on top of the
    handle? What on earth is that kettle doing? - it isn't
    standing, it isn't being lifted up - so what then? And why
    isn't that man to the right allowed to have a knee, a belly and
    lungs? Or are they located in his back? And why must his arm be
    a yard too short? And why must he do without one half of his
    nose? And why must that woman on the left have some sort of
    little tobacco-pipe stem with a little cube at the end for a
    nose?</p>

    <p>And after that, while working in such a manner, you dare
    invoke the names of Millet and Breton? Come on! in my opinion
    art is too sublime a thing to be treated so nonchalantly.</p>

    <p>Adieu, always believe me</p>

    <p>Your friend, A. G. A. v. Rappard</p>

        <p>Vincent had sent him the lithograph of his &ldquo;Potato
        Eaters,&rdquo; the picture he had been working on for many
        months, and which had &ldquo;taken a whole winter of
        painting studies of heads and hands.&rdquo; (see letter 404
        to Theo). The sketch is spoken of for the first time in
        letter 398 written in April 1885, the <i>first stage</i> of
        the picture in letter 399. After the latter the
        <i>lithograph</i> was made. The final composition is
        mentioned in letters 401, 402, 403, 404, 405 and 407.</p>
