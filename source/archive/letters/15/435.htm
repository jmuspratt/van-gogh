  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Very many thanks for the 50 francs and your letter.</p>

    <p>You will be able to understand that I shall leave next
    Tuesday if you consider, firstly, that I am simply longing for
    it, secondly, that I risk getting stuck here with my work
    through lack of models, while working out-of-doors has stopped
    because of the cold.</p>

    <p>As to my feeling the loss of a studio in Antwerp, yes, I
    certainly shall. But I must choose between a studio without
    work here, and work without a studio there.</p>

    <p>I chose the latter. And I did it so gladly that it seems to
    me like a return from exile. For I have been altogether out of
    the painters' world for a long time. And meanwhile my power has
    somewhat ripened, so that I feel more independent of the common
    intrigues, which enables me to pitch certain fellows out. I
    mean that in The Hague I was somewhat weaker with my brush than
    the rest - I don't say in my drawing - and as they asked only
    for painting and colour, I was more easily crushed than will
    prove possible now.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">As for Rubens, I am looking forward to him very much, but do
    you object to my thinking Rubens's conception and sentiment of
    his religious subjects theatrical, often even badly theatrical
    in the worst sense of the word? Look here - take Rembrandt,
    Michelangelo - take the &ldquo;Penseroso&rdquo; by
    Michelangelo. It represents a thinker, doesn't it?</label></p>

    <p>But his feet are small and swift, his hand has something of
    the lightning quickness of a lion's claw and - that thinker is
    at the same time a man of action, one sees that his thinking is
    a concentration, but - in order to jump up and act in some way
    or other. Rembrandt does it <i>differently</i>.
    Especially his Christ in <art id=emmaus>the &ldquo;Men of Emmaus&rdquo;</art> is
    more a soul in a body, which is surely different from a torso
    by Michelangelo, but still - there is something powerful in the
    gesture of persuasion.</p>

    <p>Now put a Rubens beside it, one of the many figures of
    meditative persons - and they become people who have retired
    into a corner in order to further their digestion. That's how
    it is in everything religious or philosophical he does, it is
    flat and <i>hollow</i>; but what he can paint is - women
    - like Boucher and better - there especially he gives one most
    to think about and there he is at his deepest. What he can do -
    combinations of colours - what he can do is - paint a queen, a
    statesman, well analyzed, just as they are. But the
    supernatural - where magic begins, no - unless putting
    something infinite into a woman's expression, which, however,
    is not dramatic.</p>

    <p>I found a passage about Gainsborough which again stimulates
    me to work with one stroke. Look here:</p>

    <p>It is this brusqueness of touch that produces so much
    effect. The spontaneity of his impression is all there, and
    communicates itself to the spectator. For the rest Gainsborough
    had a perfect method of ensuring the completeness of his
    composition. He planned his picture all at once, and carried it
    out harmoniously from top to bottom, without concentrating his
    attention on separate little frag-ments, without obstinately
    worrying over details, for he sought the general effect, and he
    nearly always found it, thanks to his broad vision on the
    canvas, which he looked at as one looks at nature, at a single
    glance.</p>

    <p>I shall send you the book by Ch. Blanc, etc., from Antwerp,
    as soon as I can add a few studies.</p>

    <p>As I don't know where I shall stay, I'll ask that when you
    write on December 1, address your letter c/o G.P.O., unless I
    let you know otherwise.</p>

    <p>For I shall write again one of these days.</p>

    <p>I found the enclosed sonnet by Jules Breton in a
    magazine.</p>

    <p>I repeat, as to my rather sudden departure from here, if I
    hadn't had trouble with the models, I should have spent the
    winter here. But working steadily with models here is not so
    much hampered by the priest's opposition, which in itself would
    have been neutralized by my ignoring it completely, but the
    worst is that though I have the courage to stand my ground,
    people hesitate, and are more frightened than I thought they
    would be.</p>

    <p>And I am not going to undertake it unless I am quite sure
    that they have the courage. Now it might help if I go away for
    a couple of months, and if it doesn't help, then not one of
    those to whom I gave something for it every week last winter
    will earn a penny with it this winter.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
