    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Coming home, you may have found another note I wrote you.
    But whereas in this I asked you to take back some things you
    said, now I ask you not to.</p>

    <p>For even if you should say you had come to think differently
    about things, I should not be able to believe you, as I am of
    the opinion that you are definitely like that - and that <i>it
    is not to be expected</i> that you will actually change your
    mind in the near future. When years have gone by, we shall
    <i>perhaps</i> speak about these matters in quite a different
    way, but <i>probably</i> not even then.</p>

    <p>For the time being I believe we certainly need not revert to
    the subject.</p>

    <p>What you might send next month over and above the 100
    francs, you would get back, so please send 100 francs, which
    for the time being I shall continue to count on according to
    our agreement, but nothing more.</p>

    <p>And it will be my endeavour to find something to replace
    that, and in the long run I suppose I shall succeed.</p>

    <p>Goodbye.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>[Postscript]</p>

    <p>Please do not think <i>I do not want</i> to be good friends
    - but in this case it is not in the nature of things; even if
    one should try, it would be no good - in short, it is a case
    nobody would be able to do much about.</p>

    <p>I believe that your character is now cast in a definite
    mould - mine is too - and the shapes are <i>not</i> identical.
    I cannot say I really take ill of you - neither perhaps do you
    of me - but to go on as if we were of one mind, we should have
    to be like Monsieur Joseph Prudhomme in Monnier's book, <i>and
    I at least utterly refuse to be like that</i>, and for your
    sake I hope you will do the same. So I'm not going to take it
    to heart any longer.</p>
  </body>
