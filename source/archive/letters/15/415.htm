    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half August 1885</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today I had a visit from Wenkebach, a painter from Utrecht,
    who is a friend of Rappard's. He is a landscape painter and I
    have often seen his name mentioned; he received a medal in
    London at the same time as Rappard. He has seen my work, those
    cottages which I am going to send you and also the drawings of
    figures.</p>

    <p><label content="fear.paranoia">I told him I was sorry to say there had been a
    misunderstanding between Rappard and me, which I could hardly
    explain otherwise than that he had been gossiping about my work
    with other people from The Hague, and as he had not seen
    anything of it for a long time, he had involuntarily been
    turned against me.</label> I showed Wenkebach figures which Rappard
    used to like, and at the same time the new ones, and showed him
    that indeed I had changed in some respects and would change
    even more, but that what I made now was certainly not
    inferior.</p>

    <p>Then he said that he did not doubt that Rappard would take
    back what he had written.</p>

    <p>Then I showed him that, as to colour, I certainly do not
    want to <i>always</i> paint dark. Some of my cottages are even
    quite light.</p>

    <p>But that my aim is to proceed from the primary colours -
    red, blue, yellow - and not from grey.</p>

    <p>We had a long discussion about colour, and among other
    things he said he had noticed how Jaap Maris in old
    watercolours also frequently used ruddy, brownish-grey, red
    colours. So that if one puts them beside one of his present
    drawings, they become quite red.</p>

    <p>It is the same with Isra&euml;ls.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I do more harm than good by telling you this,
    because it is only part of the conversation, and I ought to
    tell the whole of it. But we have discussed it before, so you
    will perhaps understand it in its real connection. In order to
    get an <i>honest</i>, <i>sound</i> palette, and <i>to stick to
    it</i>, it is necessary to practice the strongest colour scales
    too, and to continue to use them, especially in these days when
    imitators (not the masters themselves) of the great painters in
    grey want to paint more and more, always and everything
    <i>light</i>.</p>

    <p>So Wenkebach said, for instance, that he liked the <art id=0088>picture
    of the old tower</art> for its technique too; I painted it last year,
    with a lot of bitumen in it. He said he found it quite
    original.</p>

    <p>The same with other old things. That water mill, the plough
    with oxen, <art id-0122>the avenue of autumn trees</art>.</p>

    <p>But what pleased me most of all was that he liked the
    figures.</p>

    <p>He called them Millet-like. But I know for sure that I will
    get them even better if only I have some luck with the money
    and can continue working on them at full speed; but that is
    what rather worries me, and for this month I am
    <i>absolutely</i> cleaned out. I am literally without a
    penny.</p>

    <p>We shall have hard times; it is not all my fault, but only
    by perseverance do we have a chance to reap, after some time,
    what we are sowing.</p>

    <p>And it worries me enough that you have all those money
    troubles; I wish I could lighten them for you somewhat.</p>

    <p>When you come over to Holland, wouldn't it be advisable to
    try Tersteeg once more?</p>

    <p>Tersteeg is a man who <i>dares</i>; once he is convinced, he
    is all right. And the same with Mauve.</p>

    <p>If there were many people who persevered in <i>studying</i>
    the figure, I should say there is little chance of finding
    help.</p>

    <p>But they aren't so very numerous, and yet they aren't less
    necessary than before.</p>

    <p>It is hard for you to keep it up all by yourself, and I
    cannot do anything to lessen the expenses; on the contrary, I
    wish I could take even more models. What is to be done?</p>

    <p>One must not call it engaging in a hopeless struggle, for
    others have won, and we shall win too.</p>

    <p>As to Rappard, I just wrote to him, I want him to retract
    completely what he has written. But you see, Theo, how much
    depends on being consistent in one's work.</p>

    <p>I wrote Rappard that actually we have to fight other things
    than each other, and that at this moment those painting rural
    life and the life of the people must join hands because union
    is strength.</p>

    <p>At any rate, one cannot do it alone; a whole group that is
    of the same mind can do more. You too must be of good courage,
    for perhaps we shall make more friends and then will become
    more animated, and perhaps the mutual discord will change into
    a peasant uprising against the kind of painters one finds on
    every jury nowadays, who, if they could, would even now
    obstruct the ideas which Millet pioneered.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, send me something if you can, even if it's only 10
    francs to help me through these last days of the month.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
