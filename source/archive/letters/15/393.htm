    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You would greatly oblige me by trying to get for me:</p>

    <p>Illustration No.2174, 24th October 1884.</p>

    <p>It is already an old number, but at the office you will
    probably be able to get it. In it there is a drawing by Paul
    Renouard, a strike of the weavers at Lyons. Also one from a
    series of Opera sketches (of which he has also published
    etchings) - called &ldquo;The Harpist,&rdquo; which I like very
    much.</p>

    <p>Then he has also done just recently, &ldquo;The World of the
    Law Courts,&rdquo; which I got from Rappard, you know it
    probably from the &ldquo;Paris Illustr&eacute;&rdquo; by
    Damas.</p>

    <p>But I think the drawing of the weavers the most beautiful of
    all, there is so much life and depth in it that I think this
    drawing might hold its own beside Millet, Daumier, Lepage.</p>

    <p>When I think how he rose to such a height by working from
    the very beginning from nature, without imitating others, and
    how he is none the less in harmony with the very clever people,
    even in technique, though from the very first he had his own
    style, I find him again a proof that by truly following nature
    one's work improves every year.</p>

    <p>And I am daily more convinced that people who do not in the
    first place wrestle with nature <i>never</i> succeed.</p>

    <p>I think that if one has tried to follow attentively the
    great masters, one finds them all back at certain moments, deep
    in reality - I mean that their so-called <i>creations</i> will
    be seen by one in reality, if one has the same eyes, the same
    sentiment as they had. And I do believe that if the critics and
    connoisseurs were better acquainted with nature their judgment
    would be more correct than now, when it is the routine to live
    only among pictures, and to compare them mutually. Which of
    course, as one side of the question, is good in itself, but it
    lacks a solid basis if one begins to forget nature and looks
    only superficially. Can't you understand that I am perhaps not
    wrong in this, and to say more clearly still what I mean, is it
    not a pity that you, for instance, seldom or hardly ever enter
    those cottages, or associate with those people, or see that
    sentiment in landscape, which is painted in the pictures you
    like best. I do not say that you <i>can</i> do this in your
    position, just because one must look much and long at nature
    before one comes to the conviction that the most touching
    things the great masters have painted still find their origin
    in life and reality itself. A basis of sound poetry, which
    exists eternally as a fact, and can be found if one digs and
    seeks deeply enough.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ce qui ne passe pas dans ce qui passe,&rdquo; it
    exists. [&ldquo; The durable within the transitory&rdquo;]</p>

    <p>And what Michelangelo said in a splendid metaphor, I think
    Millet has said without metaphor, and Millet can perhaps best
    teach us to see, and get &ldquo;a faith.&rdquo; If I do better
    work later on, I certainly shall not work <i>differently</i>
    than now, I mean it will be the same apple, though riper; I
    shall not change my mind about what I have thought from the
    beginning. And that is the reason why I say for my part: if I
    am no good now, I shall be no good later on either, but if
    later on, then now too. For corn is corn, though people from
    the city may take it for grass at first, and also the other way
    round.</p>

    <p>In any case, whether people approve or do not approve of
    what I do and how I do it, I for my part know no other way than
    to wrestle so long with nature that she tells me her
    secret.</p>

    <p>All the time I am working at various heads and hands.</p>

    <p>I have also drawn some again, perhaps you would find
    something in them, perhaps not, I can't help it. I repeat, I
    know no other way.</p>

    <p>But I can't understand that you say: perhaps later on we
    shall admire even the things done now.</p>

    <p>If I were you, I should have so much self-confidence and
    independent opinion that I should know whether I could see
    <i>now</i> what there was or was not in a thing.</p>

    <p>Well, you must know those things for yourself.</p>

    <p>Though the month is not quite over, my purse is quite empty.
    I work on as hard as I can, and I for my part think that by
    constantly studying the model, I shall keep a straight
    course.</p>

    <p>I wish you could send me the money a few days before the 1st
    for that same reason, that the ends of the month are always
    hard, because the work brings such heavy expenses, and I don't
    sell any of it. <label content="feelings.ambition">But this will not go on so for ever, for I work
    too hard and too much not to arrive eventually at the point of
    being able to defray my expenses, without being in a dependent
    position.</label> For the rest, nature outside and the interiors of the
    cottages, they are splendid in their tone and sentiment just at
    present; I try hard not to lose time.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
