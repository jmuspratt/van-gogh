     Nuenen, c. 15 May 1885</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I just received Germinal, and started to read it at once. I
    have read about fifty pages, and think it splendid; I once
    travelled through these same parts on foot.</p>

    <p>Enclosed is a sketch of <art id=0141>a head</art>, which I just brought home.</p>

    <p>There was the same one among the last studies I sent you,
    namely <art id=0140>the largest of all. But painted smoothly</art>.</p>

    <p>Now I have not smoothed down the brush stroke and in fact
    the colour is quite different too.</p>

    <p>I haven't yet made a head so much &ldquo;peint avec de la
    terre,&rdquo; and more will follow now.</p>

    <p>If all goes well - if I earn a little more - so that I can
    travel more - then I hope to go and paint the miner's heads
    someday.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">But I shall work on till I am absolute master of my hand, so
    that I can work even more quickly than now, and, for instance,
    bring home about thirty studies within a month. I do not know
    if we shall earn money, but if it is only enough to let me work
    terribly hard, I shall be satisfied; the main thing is to do
    what one wants to do.</label></p>

    <p>Yes, we must do the miners someday.</p>

    <p>What did Portier say about <art id=0082>the potato eaters</art>? I know quite
    well it has its faults, but just because I see that the heads I
    am doing now are becoming more vigorous, I dare maintain that
    the potato eaters will keep its value in relation to future
    pictures, too.</p>

    <p>Last year I often got desperate about the colour, but now I
    work with more confidence. You must tell me what you think
    best, to keep my latest work for Antwerp or to send it as soon
    as possible to you and Portier. It's all the same to me, I have
    now finished seven heads and one watercolour, so I could send a
    small batch again. Goodbye, once more thanks for Germinal, I am
    still reading it as I write this. It is splendid.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
