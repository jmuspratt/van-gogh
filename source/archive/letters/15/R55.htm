  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>The reason it is necessary to put a stop to these bickerings
    is, first of all, that they begin to bear too close a
    resemblance to the dispute between a certain pair of devout
    preachers, who argued with so much ferocity over a difference
    of opinion concerning the exact geographical location of the
    road to salvation that at the very same moment and with the
    very same gesture they threw their respective wigs into each
    other's face. Indeed, the wigs would be appropriate - and -
    how, with the best will in the world, could we go on, seeing
    that we have just arrived at a critical point, and neither you
    nor I possess the indispensable missile in question? -I am
    therefore at my wits' end, and I deeply regret that we have
    started something that we are unable to bring to the
    above-mentioned triumphant end - quite worthy of the cause.</p>

    <p>Our dispute has a decidedly ridiculous side, in my opinion,
    and it is bound to get more and more so, for which reason I
    won't go into the subject any further. It is too absurd.</p>

    <p>Be sensible, and put a stop to it on your part too.</p>

    <p>All the thoughts that occur to one's mind don't come
    straight from one's conscience - whether your <i>conscience</i>
    dictated your letters to you? - whether it was your duty to
    write them? - what drivel is this! - laugh it off.</p>

    <p>But since you <i>thought</i> it was your duty, since you
    <i>thought</i> your conscience urged you to do it, I will let
    the whole business with all its extra adornments go, and so be
    <i>finished</i>.</p>

    <p>The question remains as to whether you are thinking of
    coming here to do a number of studies, and if so, approximately
    when. Then I shall see to it that you can stay at my mother's
    house as usual.</p>

    <p>With greetings,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
