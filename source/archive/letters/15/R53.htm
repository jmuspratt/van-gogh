  <body>
    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half June 1885</p>

    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I just received your letter. It is drier and prosier than
    ever.</p>

    <p>However, since you say in it, &ldquo;I want to answer your
    esteemed letter at once in order not to encourage you in your
    opinion that there is any idea of a rupture, at least on my
    part,&rdquo; I feel impelled to repeat again that you should
    know once and for all that there is at your disposal, or at the
    disposal of any painter whatever who wants to come here to make
    studies, a spare bedroom in the house where I have my studio.
    And I for my part want to advise you, as well as Wenkebach,
    whom I shall probably see tomorrow, to come here once in a
    while, as there are enough beautiful things here. If you are
    inclined to appreciate this, very good; if not, very good just
    the same. But if you come, <i>each goes his separate
    way</i>.</p>

    <p>Here is my explanation of the lithograph. I did it entirely
    from memory and in a single day; I thought a certain
    composition somewhat forced, and was using an altogether
    different process in an attempt to find a new idea to put it
    together. Besides, it was only an experiment and nothing more,
    and I used corrosives on the stone later on.</p>

    <p>Originally - although the faulty drawing of an arm or a nose
    that made you fly into a rage remains - the chiaroscuro was
    much better, as it is in the composition that I painted later.
    And as for the latter, although there are faults in it too,
    there are still things in it that keep me from regretting that
    I painted it.</p>

    <p>I cannot say that your letter of today was the least bit
    useful or necessary to me. Only I assure you that your saying
    your belief in me was shaken and all that leaves me pretty
    indifferent - you are no exception in this as far as certain
    others are concerned.<label content="attitude.people"> I let people <i>say of me and think of me
    whatever they like and treat me just as they like</i> -
    that is their business; I am not obligated to listen to their
    everlasting drivel. My parents, my teachers, Messrs. Goupil
    &amp; Co., and furthermore all kinds of friends and
    acquaintances have said so many unpleasant things to me for my
    own good and with the best intentions that in the end the
    burden has become a little too heavy for me; and since I let
    people talk without paying any attention to it, I have not
    fallen off, my friend - <i>this much I think I know for
    sure</i>.</label></p>

    <p>In reply to your remarks, however, this. It is a fact that
    your work is good; but this does not mean, amice, that you are
    always right in thinking that there are no other ways and
    methods of arriving at something good and sound than yours; I
    should like very much to talk things over with you - but please
    don't gather from this that it would mean consulting you - but
    our discussions are becoming less and less successful. Speaking
    of self-knowledge - who has it? Here again it is a matter of
    &ldquo;<i>la</i> science - <i>nul</i> ne l'a,&rdquo; only <i>de
    la</i> science - everyone greatly needs it for himself, as
    regards his good or bad propensities - and I started with
    myself. But don't think that you never deceive yourself because
    of a lack of it, don't think you never hurt others horribly and
    undeservedly with superficial judgments&hellip;</p>

    <p>I know, <i>everyone</i> does this, and yet we must try to
    put up with each other. But -for <i>you</i> to speak about
    self-knowledge - no, my friend, I am awfully sorry that
    <i>you</i> should touch upon the subject, as I am afraid it is
    the very weakest side of your character, from a human point of
    view. Oh well - but I will try to state clearly <i>what I think
    about when I think about you</i>.</p>

    <p>As far as your work goes - there you are! - I think your
    present work is excellent - but here comes a thought exactly as
    it is in my mind, without concealing anything - I have known
    you for a pretty long time. There was a time - immediately
    <i>before</i> and immediately <i>after</i> your illness - when
    you were much <i>less</i> dry as a human being than you have
    been at other times - fuller, milder, broader, more generous -
    more straightforward and ingenuous.</p>

    <p>Now you are speaking to me and behaving to me exactly as a
    certain <i>abominably</i> arrogant Rappard studying at a
    certain academy did at one time.</p>

    <p>I am sorry that <i>this</i> acquaintance has come back to
    me, and I am still more sorry for the loss of you as a friend,
    which you were in the exceptional period when I found you
    changed and improved; and seeing that I have observed this, I
    can't help thinking, What about his work?? - will that too be
    broader, fuller, nobler <i>for only a short time</i>?? Do you
    know the answer to that?</p>

    <p>I have taken only half a sheet of paper to express this
    thought, but you will see from it that I am afraid at times
    that your work too may lose the nobler quality. I think I am
    stating this idea clearly and simply.</p>

    <p>Whatever my faults of character may be, it is my sincerest
    desire to do well in my efforts as a painter, and I also have
    the sincere desire to treat others well - I have too much heart
    to be <i>as</i> frivolous in my work as you are always
    reproaching me with being. I need not take what you wrote to
    heart, and I don't do so. And as for your saying that I am in
    need of someone who will tell me some home truths, that may be
    true, but it may also be true that I <i>myself</i> am the one
    to tell me some home truths, and that I can do without other
    people, especially if they are as prosy as you are.</p>

    <p>Greetings. But your letter, as a whole, was unfair, even
    though there are details in it that are more or less
    accurate.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>You do not write me anything about your work, nor do I about
    mine.</p>
