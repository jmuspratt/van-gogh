  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Enclosed you will find some interesting pages about
    <i>colour</i>, namely the great principles which Delacroix
    believed in.</p>

    <p>Add to this &ldquo;les anciens ne prenaient pas par la
    ligne, mais par les milieux,&rdquo; that means, starting with
    the circular or elliptical bases of the masses, instead of the
    contour.</label></p>

    <p>I found the exact words for the latter in Gigoux's book, but
    the fact itself had already preoccupied me a long time. I
    believe the fuller of sentiment a thing one makes is, and the
    more true to nature, the more it is criticized and the more
    animosity it rouses, but after all, in the end it will rise
    above the criticism.</p>

    <p>I was very glad to hear Portier's opinion, but the question
    is whether he will stick to it. But I know some of those rare
    people who have &ldquo;foi de charbonnier&rdquo; do exist, and
    don't swing back and forth with public opinion. I am very glad
    that he found &ldquo;personality&rdquo; in it. In fact, I try
    more and more to be myself, caring relatively little whether
    people approve or disapprove of it. I don't mean to say that I
    don't care whether Mr. Portier sticks to his good opinion; on
    the contrary, I will try to make things which strengthen him in
    it.</p>

    <p>By the same mail you will receive a few copies of <art id=1661>a
    lithograph</art>. I should like to make, with a few alterations, a
    definite picture of the sketch I painted in the cottage. And
    that would perhaps be one which Portier could show, or which we
    could send to an exhibition. At least it is a subject which I
    have felt, and such as it is, I myself could point out, as well
    as other critics, its weak points and some <i>absolute
    mistakes</i>. But there is a certain life in it, perhaps more
    than in some pictures that are absolutely faultless.</p>

    <p>I too believe that if Henri Pille had had to decide, Le Chat
    Noir might not have refused it.</p>

    <p>After all I don't care much, for in order to be quite
    independent, I want to learn to make lithographs myself.</p>

    <p>If I make a picture of the sketch, I shall make at the same
    time a new lithograph of it, and in such a way that the
    figures, which, I am sorry to say, are now turned the wrong
    way, come right again.</p>

    <p>Not to make the letter too heavy, for Mother is writing too,
    I'm stopping; I shall write soon again; thanks for your letter.
    With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Translation of the French pages by Delacroix]</p>

    <p>The ancients admitted only three primary colours: yellow,
    red and blue, and the modern painters do not admit any others.
    In fact, these three colours are the only indissoluble and
    irreducible ones. Everybody knows that sunlight is made up of a
    series of seven colours, which Newton called primitive -
    violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red; but it is
    clear that the appellation &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; cannot be
    applied to three of these colours, which are composite, for
    orange is got by mixing red and yellow; green, by mixing yellow
    and blue; and violet, by mixing blue and red. As to indigo, it
    cannot be counted among the primitive colours, for it is only a
    variety of blue. So in accordance with antiquity it must be
    acknowledged that there are only three colours which are truly
    elementary in nature, and which, when they are mixed two at a
    time, produce three more composite colours which may be called
    secondary, to whit: orange, green and violet.</p>

    <p>These rudiments, developed by modern scientists, have led to
    the conjecture of certain laws that form an illuminating theory
    of colours, a theory which Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix commanded
    scientifically and thoroughly, after grasping it instinctively.
    (See his Grammaire des arts de dessin, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed.
    Renouard.) If one combines two of the primary colours, for
    instance yellow and red, in order to produce a secondary colour
    - orange - this secondary colour will attain maximum brilliancy
    when it is put close to the third primary colour not used in
    the mixture. In the same way, if one combines red and blue in
    order to produce violet, this secondary colour, violet, will be
    intensified by the immediate proximity of yellow. And finally,
    if one combines yellow and blue in order to produce green, this
    green will be intensified by the immediate proximity of red.
    Each of the three primitive colours is rightly called
    complementary with regard to the corresponding secondary
    colours. Thus blue is the complementary colour of orange;
    yellow, the complementary colour of violet; and red, the
    complementary colour of green. Conversely, each of the combined
    colours is the complementary colour of the primitive one not
    used in the mixture. This mutual intensification is what is
    called the law of simultaneous contrast.</p>

    <p>When the complementary colours are produced in equal
    strength, that is to say in the same degree of vividness and
    brightness, their juxtaposition will intensify them each to
    such a violent intensity that the human eye can hardly bear the
    sight of it.</p>

    <p>And due to a singular phenomenon, <i>the same colours which
    strengthen each other by their juxtaposition will destroy each
    other when they are mixed</i>. So if one mixes blue and orange
    in equal quantities, the orange will be as little orange as the
    blue is blue, the mixture destroys the two tints, and there
    emerges an <i>absolutely colourless grey</i>.</p>

    <p>But if one mixes two complementary colours in unequal
    proportions, they only partially destroy each other, and one
    gets a <i>broken tone</i>, which will be a variety of grey.
    This being so, new contrasts may be born of the juxtaposition
    of two complementary colours, one of which is pure and the
    other, broken. As the fight is unequal, one of the two colours
    gains the victory, and the intensity of the dominant colour
    does not preclude the harmony of the two.</p>

    <p>Now, if one brings together similar colours in a pure state
    but in different degrees of intensity, one gets another effect,
    in which there will be a contrast through the difference in
    intensity and at the same time harmony through the similarity
    of the colours. Finally, if two similar colours are placed next
    to each other, the one in a pure state, the other broken, for
    instance pure blue and grey-blue, another kind of contrast will
    result, which will be toned down by the analogy. So it is clear
    that there are various means, divergent among themselves, but
    equally infallible, by which to intensify, to maintain, to
    weaken or to neutralize a colour's effect, and this by its
    reaction to the contiguous tones - by its touching what is not
    itself.</p>

    <p>In order to intensify and to harmonize the effect of his
    colours he used the contrast of the complementary and the
    concord of the analogous colours at the same time; or in other
    terms, the repetition of a vivid tint by the same broken
    tone.</p>
