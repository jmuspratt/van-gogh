    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup>. Half June 1885</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I think you will have received the box by now.</p>

    <p>I must tell you that I have another similar subject, <art id=0091>a white
    clay cottage, the size more in the breadth</art>.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I witnessed a large forest fire on a blazing hot
    afternoon. It was a wood in the middle of a bare stretch of
    moor, and those enormous masses of black-and-white smoke that
    went straight up into the air were a peculiar sight. The fire
    was limited to the heath, the fir needles and dry twigs. The
    stems remained standing.</p>

    <p>I am very busy drawing figures, but I shall have to make a
    hundred of them before I paint them, as this will save me time
    and money.</p>

    <p>I think they are getting rounder and fuller than at
    first.</p>

    <p>But I am absolutely without money, and hardly know how to
    get to the end of the month.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">At times it makes me quite melancholy that the result is
    always &ldquo;unsaleable.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But I go on, and harden myself against it.</label></p>

    <p>Others have had to bear it too. Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Hasn't there been a Lhermitte number this May?</p>

    <p>I repeat - work in spite of all <i>indifference</i> is not
    easy to keep up, but what is easy isn't worth much.</p>

    <p>Painting rural life is a thing that will keep its value, and
    the fight won by others <i>continues</i> all the same. And one
    can win it anew. Far from there being too many painters of
    rural life - in my opinion it would be better to have some
    hundreds more.</p>

    <p>It is no bad idea that in France they are decorating the
    town halls with scenes from rural life, like a number of
    pictures at the Salon. I suppose they will carry it still
    further.</p>

    <p>But - it is even better that the pictures of peasants get
    into <i>houses</i> in magazines and other reproductions,
    directly among the people.</p>

    <p>And so my being discouraged is only a passing mood.</p>

    <p>At home I heard that you had written them something about
    Serret, his having said that I could count on his sympathy,
    etc. Is Serret a painter, a dealer or an art lover? Up to now
    I'd never heard of him. I wanted to put Germinal into the box
    with the pictures, but in the end I was afraid it would get
    shoved in between the pictures and damage them. But I shall put
    it in the next box or return it by post; I think it is
    splendid.</p>
