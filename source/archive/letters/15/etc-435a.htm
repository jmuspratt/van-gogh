    <p>In the summer of 1949 I heard the following details in
    Nuenen:</p>

    <p>Johannes de Looyer (born April 14, 1873) and Karel van
    Engeland (born November 10, 1878) told me that as boys they had
    hunted bird's nests for Vincent at 10 cents (twopence)
    apiece.</p>

    <p>Hendricus Dekkers (born January 26, 1875) told me that he
    got 5 cents and for two blackbirds' nests, 10 cents. Once he
    received 50 cents for a swallow's nest. Vincent took him along
    on walks, and talked a lot with him. <label content="lifestyle.appearance">He wore blue linen
    trousers and a smock, and had a little red chin-tuft; he was
    &ldquo;an ugly creature.&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>Vincent had painted his father weaving in the little house
    where Dekkers was living now; he was very quick at drawing.</p>

    <p>The models portrayed in the B. de la Faille pictures are No.
    136: Sien de Groot, No. F 1446: Mieke van Rooy - and one of the
    weavers: Toon Swinkels.</p>
