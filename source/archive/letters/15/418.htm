  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I wish the 4 canvases I wrote to you about had gone. If I
    keep them here for much longer, I might paint them over again
    and I think it's better if you get them just as they come, off
    the heath. The reason I haven't sent them is that I don't want
    to send them to you carriage forward at a time when you say
    that you yourself might be short of cash, and I cannot afford
    the carriage myself.</p>

    <p>I have never seen the little house in which Millet lived -
    but I imagine that these 4 little human nests are of the same
    sort. One is the residence of a gentleman popularly known as
    &ldquo;the mourning peasant&rdquo; - <art id=0089>the other is inhabited by
    a worthy soul who, when I went there, was up to nothing more
    mysterious than digging her potato-clamp, but who must be
    capable of practicing witchcraft - she goes by the name of
    &ldquo;the witch's head,&rdquo; anyway</art>.</p>

    <p>You'll remember that Gigoux's book tells how it came about
    that 17 of Delacroix's pictures were turned down all at the
    same time. That shows - to me at least - that he and others of
    that period were faced with connoisseurs and non-connoisseurs
    alike, who neither understood them nor wanted to buy anything
    by them - but that they, who are rightly called &ldquo;les
    vaillants&rdquo; [the brave] in the book, didn't talk of
    fighting a losing battle but <i>went on painting</i>.</p>

    <p>What I wanted to say again is that if we take that story
    about Delacroix as our starting point, we still have a lot of
    painting to do.</p>

    <p>I find myself faced with the necessity of being that most
    disagreeable of people, in other words of having to ask for
    money. And since I don't think that sales will pick up in the
    next few days, the situation seems rather dire. But I put it to
    you, isn't it better for both of us, apr&egrave;s tout, to work
    hard, no matter what problems that may entail, than to sit
    around philosophizing at a time like this?</p>

    <p>I can't tell the future, Theo - but I do know the eternal
    law that all things change. Think back 10 years, and things
    were different, the circumstances, the mood of the people, in
    short everything. And 10 years hence much is bound to have
    changed again. But <i>what one does</i> remains - and one does
    not easily regret having done it. The more active one is, the
    better, and I would sooner have a failure than sit idle and do
    nothing.</p>

    <p>Whether or not Portier is the right man to do something with
    my work - we need him now at any rate. And this is what I have
    in mind. After, say, a year's work, we shall have put together
    more than we have now, and I know for sure that my work will
    fare better the more I can add to it. People who show some
    liking for it now, who speak of it as he does, and show it from
    time to time are useful, because if I work for, let's say,
    another year and they are able to add a few more things to
    their collection, that will speak for itself even if the
    collectors themselves have nothing to say at all.</p>

    <p>If you happen to see Portier, tell him that, far from giving
    up, I intend sending him much more. You, too, must go on
    showing my work if you meet people. It won't be all that long
    before we have more important things to show.</p>

    <p>You yourself will have seen - and it is something that
    pleases me enormously - that 1-man shows, or shows by just a
    few who belong together, are becoming increasingly popular. I'm
    sure that in the art world this has more avenir [future] than
    other ventures.</p>

    <p>It's a good thing people are beginning to realize that a
    Bouguereau does not do well next to a Jacque - or a figure by
    Beyle or Lhermitte next to a Schelfhout or Koekkoek. Scatter
    Raffaelli's drawings about and judge for yourself if it's still
    possible to get a good idea of that singular artist. He -
    Raffaelli - is different from R&eacute;gamey, but I think he
    has just as much personality.</p>

    <p>If I kept my work with me, I am sure I should go on
    repainting it. Sending it to you and Portier just as it comes
    from the countryside or from the cottages, I may well include
    an example that isn't any good - but some things will have been
    saved that would not have been improved by frequent
    repainting.</p>

    <p>Now supposing you had these 4 canvases and a few smaller
    studies of cottages, someone who saw nothing else of mine would
    be bound to think that I painted nothing but cottages. And
    likewise with the series of heads. But peasant life involves so
    many different things, that when Millet speaks of
    &ldquo;travailler comme <i>plusiers</i> n&egrave;gres&rdquo;
    [working like a bunch of slaves], this is truly what has to be
    done if one wants to assemble a body of work.</p>

    <p>One may laugh at Courbet's saying, &ldquo;Peindre des anges!
    Qui est-ce qui a vu des anges?&rdquo; [Painting angels! Who has
    ever seen angels?] But to that I should like to add, &ldquo;des
    justices au harem, qui est-ce qui a vu des justices au
    harem?&rdquo; [Justice in the harem, who has ever seen justice
    in the harem?] And Benjamin Constant's painting, Des Combats de
    Taureaux, &ldquo;qui est-ce qui en a vu?&rdquo; [Bullfights,
    who has ever seen those?] And so many other Moorish and Spanish
    things, cardinals, and then all those historical paintings they
    keep on doing yards high and yards wide! What is the use of it
    all and what are they doing it for? Within a few years most of
    it looks dull and dreary and more and more boring. But still,
    perhaps they are well painted, they could be that.</p>

    <p>Nowadays, when connoisseurs stand in front of a painting
    like the one by Benj. Constant, or like some reception given by
    some cardinal by I don't know which Spaniard - it's the custom
    to say, with a meaningful air, something about &ldquo;clever
    technique.&rdquo; But as soon as those same connoisseurs are
    confronted by a subject from peasant life or a drawing by, say,
    Raffaelli, they criticize the technique with the same knowing
    air - &agrave; la C. M.</p>

    <p>You may think I'm wrong to comment on this, but I'm so
    struck by the fact that all these exotic pictures were painted
    <i>in the studio</i>. <label content="art.technique">Just try going outside and painting
    things on the spot! All sorts of things happen then. I had to
    pick off a good hundred or more flies from the 4 canvases
    you're about to receive, not to mention dust and sand, etc.,
    not to mention the fact that if one carries them through heath
    and hedgerows for a couple of hours, a branch or two is likely
    to scratch them, etc. Not to mention the fact that when one
    arrives on the heath, one feels tired and hot after a couple of
    hours' walk in this weather. Not to mention the fact that the
    figures don't stand still like professional models, and that
    the effects one wants to capture change as the day wears
    on.</label></p>

    <p>I don't know how it is with you - but as far as I am
    concerned, the more I work at it, the more absorbed I get in
    peasant life. And the less I care for Cabanel-like things,
    among which I would include Jacquet, and the present-day Benj.
    Constant - or the highly praised but inexpressibly, hopelessly
    dry technique of the Italians &amp; Spaniards.
    &ldquo;Imagiers!&rdquo; [Popular print makers!] I often think
    of that term of Jacque's.</p>

    <p>Yet I do have <i>parti pris</i> [prejudice], I respond to
    Raffaelli, who paints something quite other than peasants - I
    respond to Alfred Stevens, to Tissot, to mention something
    completely different from peasants - I respond to a beautiful
    portrait.</p>

    <p>Zola, who otherwise, in my opinion, makes some colossal
    blunders when he judges pictures, says something beautiful
    about art in general in Mes haines: &ldquo;Dans le tableau
    (l'oeuvre d'art), je cherche, j'aime l'homme -
    l'artiste.&rdquo; [In the picture (the work of art), I look
    for, I love the man - the artist.]</p>

    <p>There you have it; I think that's absolutely true. I ask
    you, what kind of <i>man</i>, what kind of visionary, or
    <i>thinker</i>, observer, what kind of human character is there
    behind certain canvases extolled for their technique - often
    <i>no kind at all</i>, as you know. But a Raffaelli is
    somebody, a Lhermitte is <i>somebody</i>, and with many
    pictures by almost unknown people one has the feeling that they
    were made with a <i>will</i>, with <i>feeling</i>, with
    <i>passion</i>, with <i>love</i>.</p>

    <p>The <i>technique</i> of a painting from peasant life or - in
    Raffaelli's case - from the heart of urban workers, introduces
    problems quite other than those of the smooth painting and
    portrayal of actions of a Jacquet or Benjamin Constant. Namely,
    living in cottages day in and day out, being out in the fields
    just like the peasants - in the heat of the sun in summer,
    enduring snow and frost in winter, not indoors but out in the
    open, and not just while taking a walk but day in, day out,
    like the peasants themselves.</p>

    <p>And I ask you, all things considered, am I really so wrong
    to object to the criticisms of those experts, who more than
    ever before bandy this so <i>often</i> irrelevant word
    &ldquo;technique&rdquo; about (giving it an increasingly
    conventional relevance)? Considering all the traipsing and
    trudging it takes to paint &ldquo;the mourning peasant&rdquo;
    in his cottage, I dare say this work involves a longer, more
    tiring journey than the one so many painters of exotic subjects
    - whether &ldquo;la justice au harem&rdquo; or &ldquo;reception
    at a cardinal's&rdquo; - have to go on to produce their
    choicest eccentric subjects - since Arabic or Spanish or
    Moorish models are readily available, against payment, in
    Paris. But anyone who, like Raffaelli, paints the ragpickers of
    Paris <i>in their own quarter</i>, has greater problems and his
    work is more serious.</p>

    <p><i>Nothing seems simpler than painting peasants or
    ragpickers and other workers, but - there are no subjects in
    painting as difficult as those everyday figures</i>! As far as
    I know, not a single academy exists in which one can learn to
    draw and paint a digger, a sower, a woman hanging a pot over
    the fire, or a seamstress. But every city of any importance has
    an academy with a choice of models for historical, Arabic,
    Louis XV - in a nutshell, <i>every sort of figure, provided
    they do not exist in reality</i>.</p>

    <p>When I send you and Serret a few studies of diggers or
    peasant women weeding, gleaning corn, etc., <i>as the first</i>
    of a whole series on all kinds of work in the fields, you or
    Serret may discover flaws in them, which it will be helpful to
    me to know about and which I shall in all probability
    acknowledge.</p>

    <p>But I should like to point out something perhaps worthy of
    consideration. All academic figures are put together in the
    same way, and, let us admit, &ldquo;on ne peut mieux&rdquo; [it
    cannot be done better] - impeccably - <i>faultlessly</i>. You
    will have gathered what I am driving at - they do not lead us
    to <i>any new discoveries</i>.</p>

    <p>Not so the figures of a Millet, a Lhermitte, a
    R&eacute;gamey, a Lhermitte [sic], a Daumier. They are also
    well put together - but <i>apr&egrave;s tout, not the way the
    academy teaches</i>. I believe that no matter how academically
    correct a figure may be, it is superfluous, though it were by
    Ingres himself (with the exception of his Source, because that
    <i>surely</i> was, is and always shall be, something new), once
    it lacks that essential modern aspect, the intimate character,
    the real <i>action</i>.</p>

    <p>You may ask, when will the figure <i>not</i> be superfluous,
    for all its faults, and grave faults to my way of thinking?
    When the digger digs, when the peasant is a peasant and the
    peasant woman is a peasant woman, is this anything new? Yes,
    even the little figures by Ostade and Terborch don't work as
    people do today.</p>

    <p>I could say much more on the subject, and I should like to
    say how much I myself want to improve what I have begun - and
    how much more highly I value the work of some others than I do
    my own. I ask you - do you know of a single digger, a single
    sower, in the old Dutch school? Did they ever try to do
    &ldquo;a worker&rdquo;? Did Vel&aacute;squez look for one in
    his water carrier or his types from the people? No.
    <i>Work</i>, that's what the figures in the old pictures don't
    do.</p>

    <p>I've been plodding away the last few days at a woman whom I
    saw pulling carrots in the snow last winter. Look - Millet has
    done it, Lhermitte, and by and large the painters of peasants
    from this century - say an Isra&euml;ls - they consider it more
    beautiful than anything else. But even in this century, how
    relatively few among the legion of artists paint <i>the
    figure</i> - yes, <i>for the figure's sake</i> avant tout
    [above all], i.e. for the sake of form and model&eacute;
    [modelling], yet <i>cannot imagine it otherwise than in
    action</i>, and want - what the old masters and even the old
    Dutch masters who depicted so many conventional actions avoided
    - want, as I say, <i>to paint the action for the action's
    sake</i>. So that the painting or the drawing has to be a
    <i>figure</i> drawing for the sake of the figure and of the
    unutterably harmonious form of the human body - but at the same
    time a <i>pulling of carrots in the snow</i>. Do I make myself
    clear? I hope so, and you might mention it to Serret.</p>

    <p>I can put it more succinctly - a nude by Cabanel, a lady by
    Jacquet, and a peasant woman <i>not by Bastien Lepage</i>, but
    by a <i>Parisian</i> who has learned his drawing at the
    academy, will always convey the limbs and the structure of the
    body in the same way - sometimes charming, accurate in
    proportion and anatomical detail. But when Isra&euml;ls, or,
    say, Daumier or Lhermitte, draw a figure, one gets much more of
    a sense of the <i>shape</i> of the body, and yet - and that's
    the very reason I'm pleased to include Daumier - the
    proportions will sometimes be almost <i>arbitrary</i>, the
    anatomy and structure often anything but correct <i>in the eyes
    of the academicians</i>. But it will <i>live</i>. And Delacroix
    too, in particular.</p>

    <p>It still isn't well put. Tell Serret <i>that I should be in
    despair if my figures were good</i>, tell him that I don't
    <i>want</i> them to be academically correct, tell him that what
    I'm trying to say is that if one were to <i>photograph</i> a
    digger, he would certainly not be <i>digging</i> then. Tell him
    that I think Michelangelo's figures are splendid, although the
    legs are unquestionably too long, the hips and buttocks too
    broad. Tell him that, to my mind, Millet and Lhermitte are the
    true artists, because they do not paint things as they are,
    examined in a dry analytical manner, but as they, Millet,
    Lhermitte, Michelangelo, feel them to be. Tell him that I long
    most of all to learn how to produce those very inaccuracies,
    those very aberrations, reworkings, transformations of reality,
    as may turn it into, well - a lie if you like - but truer than
    the literal truth.</p>

    <p>And now it's nearly time to close - but I felt the need to
    say once more that those who paint peasant life or the life of
    the people, though they may not be counted among the
    &ldquo;hommes du monde&rdquo; [men of the world], may well stay
    the course better in the long run than the creators of exotic
    harems and cardinal's receptions, painted in Paris.</p>

    <p>I know that it is disagreeable of one to ask for money at
    awkward moments - but my excuse is that painting what appear to
    be the most commonplace things is sometimes the most difficult
    and expensive. The expenses that <i>I must incur if I want to
    work</i> are at times considerable when compared with my means.
    I assure you that had my constitution not become virtually like
    that of a peasant, through exposure to the elements, I should
    not have been able to endure it, for there is simply nothing
    left over for my personal comfort. But then I don't seek that
    for myself either, any more than many peasants seek anything
    other than to live as they do. But what I do ask for is paint,
    and above all models.</p>

    <p>From what I write about the figure drawings you will no
    doubt have gathered that I am particularly keen on going ahead
    with them. You wrote not long ago that Serret had spoken to you
    &ldquo;with conviction&rdquo; about certain faults in the
    structure of the figures in the Potato Eaters. But you will
    have seen from my answer that I found fault on that score
    myself as well, though I did point out that this was my
    impression after I had seen the cottage many evenings in the
    dim lamplight, after I had painted 40 heads, from which follows
    that I set out from a different point of view.</p>

    <p>However, now that we have started to discuss the figure, I
    have a great deal to say. I find Raffaelli's perception of
    &ldquo;character,&rdquo; that is, the words he uses to describe
    it, good and well chosen and exemplified by the drawings. But
    those who, like Raffaelli, move in artistic and literary
    circles in Paris, have, apr&egrave;s tout, different ideas
    from, for instance, mine, out here in the country among the
    peasants. My point is that they are looking for a single word
    that will sum up all their ideas - he suggests the word
    &ldquo;character&rdquo; for the figures of the future. I agree
    with that, with what I think is the meaning - but I believe as
    little in the accuracy of the word as in the accuracy of other
    words - as little as in the accuracy or effectiveness of my own
    expressions.</p>

    <p>Rather than say, &ldquo;there must be character in a
    digger,&rdquo; I would put it like this: the peasant must be a
    peasant, the digger must dig, and then there will be something
    essentially modern in them. But I feel that even these words
    may give rise to misconceptions - even were I to add a whole
    string of them.</p>

    <p>Far from cutting down on the expenses for models - which is
    a fairly heavy burden on me now as it is - I think spending a
    little more is called for, very much called for. For what I am
    aiming at is quite different from doing &ldquo;a little
    figure&rdquo; drawing. To show the <i>peasant figure in
    action</i>, that - I repeat - is what an essentially modern
    figure painting really does, it is the very essence of modern
    art, something neither the Greeks nor the Renaissance nor the
    old Dutch school have done.</p>

    <p>This is a question I ponder every day. The difference
    between the great, or the lesser, masters of today (the great,
    e.g. Millet, Lhermitte, Breton, Herkomer; the lesser, e.g.
    Raffaelli and R&eacute;gamey) and the old schools is, however,
    something I have rarely seen expressed in articles about art.
    just think about it and see if you don't agree. They started
    doing peasants' and workmen's figures as a &ldquo;genre&rdquo;
    - but nowadays, with Millet, the perennial master, in the lead,
    these figures have become the very essence of modern art and so
    they will remain.</p>

    <p>People like Daumier - one must respect them, for they are
    among the pioneers. The simple <i>but modern nude</i> - as
    revived by Henner and Lefevre - ranks high. Baudry, and above
    all such sculptors as Mercier and Dalou, are also amongst the
    very soundest. But the fact is that peasants and ouvriers
    [workers] are not nudes, nor does one need to imagine them in
    the nude. The more that people begin to do workers' and
    peasants' figures, the better I shall like it. And for myself,
    I can think of nothing I like as much.</p>

    <p>This is a long letter and I'm not even sure if I've made
    myself entirely clear. Perhaps I'll write a few lines to Serret
    too. If I do, I'll send the letter to you to read, for I do
    want to make plain how much importance I attach to the figure
    issue.</p>
