  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for the early remittance of this month's money,
    which, coming early, in fact helps me more. Thanks also for the
    splendid wood engraving, after Lhermitte, one of the few things
    of his I know, for I have only seen the following: a group of
    girls in a cornfield, an old woman in a church, a miner or some
    such type in a little bar and &ldquo;La Moisson&rdquo; [The
    Harvest], and that's all, and none of these giving an idea of
    his real technique the way these woodcutters do. If Le Monde
    Illustr&eacute; gives a composition of his every month - this
    one forms part of a series &ldquo;Les Mois Rustiques&rdquo; - I
    should like very much to have the whole series, and I shall be
    very glad if you will send them. For of course I never see
    anything here, and after all I need to see some beautiful
    things now and then; so just deduct 20 francs someday, but send
    me such things whenever they appear in the magazines.</p>

    <p>As to what you write, that if I had anything ready which I
    thought suitable, you would try and send it in for the Salon, I
    appreciate your being willing to do so.</p>

    <p>This in the first place, and further, that had I known it
    six weeks ago, I should have tried to send you something for
    this purpose.</p>

    <p>Now I have nothing that I should care to send in; lately I
    have, as you know, painted heads almost exclusively, and they
    are studies in the real sense of the word - that is to say,
    they are meant for the studio.</p>

    <p>However, today I at once started to make some, which I will
    send you. Because I think it might be useful if, when you meet
    a good many people on the occasion of the Salon, you have
    something to show - even if it's only <i>studies</i>.</p>

    <p>So you will receive an old model, and a young woman's head,
    and probably more than one of these two models.</p>

    <p>As to what you write of your feelings about various
    conceptions of heads, I believe that these which come straight
    out of a cottage with a moss-covered thatched roof will not
    seem absolutely inappropriate to you, though they are nothing
    but studies.</p>

    <p>Had I known it six weeks ago, I should have made of it a
    woman spinning or a woman spooling yarn - a whole figure.</p>

    <p>To return for a moment to the subject of the women's heads,
    genre Jacquet, not the earlier ones, but those of the present.
    Take the reaction against it, which certainly has a motive. Or
    consider the people who paint heads of girls such as our
    sister, for instance; I can perfectly well understand there are
    painters who do so. Whistler did it well several times;
    Millais, Boughton - only to mention people of whom I saw
    something of the kind at one time; I know but little of Fantin
    Latour, but what I saw I thought excellent, Chardin-like. And
    that's saying a lot.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.reclusive">I, for my part, however,
    am not the personality to have had
    much chance of getting on a sufficiently intimate footing with
    girls of that sort for them to be willing to pose for me.
    Especially not with my own sisters.</p>

    <p>And perhaps I am also prejudiced against women who wear
    dresses. And my territory is more those who wear jackets and
    skirts.</label> But I think what you say true - namely, that they
    <i>can</i> very well be painted, and that it has its raison
    d'&ecirc;tre as a reaction against the present-day Jacquets,
    and Van Beers, etc. but - Chardin (let's summarize the aim of
    that reaction in his name, Fantin Latour at least would approve
    of this) was a Frenchman, and painted
    &ldquo;Fran&ccedil;aises.&rdquo; And in my opinion the
    <i>respectable Dutch</i> woman very, very often lacks the charm
    that French women frequently have. Consequently the so-called
    respectable class of Dutch women is not so very particularly
    attractive to paint, or to think of. But on the contrary,
    certain ordinary servant girls are again very Chardin-like.</p>

    <p>Just now I paint not only as long as there is daylight, but
    even in the evening by the lamp in the cottages, when I can
    hardly distinguish anything on my palette, so as to catch, if
    possible, something of the curious effects of lamplight in the
    evening, with, for instance, a large shadow cast on the
    wall.</p>

    <p>It is a fact that in the last few years I certainly have not
    seen anything as beautiful as those woodcutters by Lhermitte.
    How completely according to intention and full of feeling his
    figures are in that composition. Again, many thanks for it.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>The Chardin-esque is in my opinion a peculiar expression of
    <i>simplicity</i> and <i>goodness</i> - both <i>through and
    through</i> - and I have some doubts about whether something
    like either quality might be found, for instance, in one of our
    sisters. But if Wil were a Frenchwoman instead of being a
    clergyman's daughter, she <i>might</i> have it. But one is
    <i>nearly always</i> driven from one's course to the opposite
    side of the world.</p>
