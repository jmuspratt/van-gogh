  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today being Sunday, I want to write you again.</p>

    <p>Because I forgot to say something of Uhde's picture,
    &ldquo;Laissez venir &agrave; moi les petits
    enfants.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Yes, I like it, but it isn't new.</p>

    <p>And I prefer interiors in a bright tone with peasant
    children, <i>without</i> a mystic figure of Christ, as
    Isra&euml;ls or Artz paint them, to this one, where one gets a
    mystic Christ into the bargain.</p>

    <p>The children are very expressive - but are they better than
    those by Labrichon, Fr&egrave;re or even Knaus, Vautier (in
    their best period)?</p>

    <p>Do not think this unimportant, for all those people I
    mention were, especially in the past, extraordinarily clever in
    expressing character.</p>

    <p>My objection to Uhde's picture is that there is a certain
    coldness in it like in new brick houses and schools and the
    Methodist churches. And notwithstanding the great merits of the
    picture, excuse me, but it makes me long for Decamps's or
    Isabey's less orthodox style of painting.</p>

    <p>There is after all something consumptive in it, and I think
    a Corot, a Dupr&eacute;, a Millet, infinitely healthier in
    tone.</p>

    <p>But I can only judge from the reproduction; perhaps if I saw
    the picture, I should get more reconciled to it as to
    technique.</p>

    <p>You know how much I like the bright painters too, but you
    see it goes too far, and Mantz expresses it very subtly when he
    says, &ldquo;Ceux qui r&ecirc;vent toujours partout le maximum
    des clairs, trouveraient d'une intensit&eacute; un peu noire
    les verts de M. Harpignies&rdquo; [those who are forever and
    everywhere dreaming of the maximum of light tones would find
    Mr. Harpignies's greens somewhat black].</p>

    <p>That's it exactly: They begin to find heresy in every effect
    against a strong and coloured light, in every shadow - they
    never seem to walk early in the morning or in the evening at
    sunset - they want to see nothing but full daylight, or
    gaslight, or even electric light!</p>

    <p>Now, the effect of all this on me is that I sometimes detect
    in myself a longing to see things like, for instance,
    &ldquo;The Moving Out&rdquo; by Nuyen, like an old Leys, like a
    Cabat, a Diaz, or Lepoitevin.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you will call this nothing but my constant
    waywardness. But I begin by admitting that I find Uhde's
    picture very good; only having found it good, I became
    conscious of an aftertaste that is not altogether peasant, at
    least not cheering, because that kind of painter generally
    doesn't improve in his later pictures.</p>

    <p>Well, it is a typical picture for the house Goupil &amp;
    Co.; of their best. They have also had Knaus at Goupil's, and
    Labrichon too. I assure you that I do not systematically
    despise all this, far from it. Does it express what I mean when
    I say it thus: &ldquo;It is a <i>good</i> picture of Messrs.
    Goupil &amp; Co.'s?&rdquo; Does it express what I mean when I
    say, &ldquo;Beaucoup, mais <i>beaucoup</i> de talent - autant
    que possible - du g&eacute;nie? <i>Non.</i>&rdquo; [Lots, oh,
    <i>lots</i> of talent - as much as you like - but genius?
    <i>No</i>.]</p>

    <p>This picture of Uhde's is much more German (notice in
    Mantz's article how slyly he chaffs Meyerheim, &ldquo;<i>nature
    mortier</i>&rdquo; <sup>1</sup> - did you notice it?), I
    repeat, much more German than it seems.</p>

    <p>Oh, how wise, those new, those arrogant people of the new
    progress who criticize Harpignies, I am sure that you cannot
    stand them either, and in character they are a new edition of
    Monnier's M. Prudhomme.</p>

    <p>To speak of something more stimulating. I enclose a wood
    engraving after Clausen; he began rather in a German style but
    has improved, as Neuhuys also often improved.</p>

    <p>The reason why I send you this little print is - here at
    last you have something of English art; it reminds me of work
    by Pinwell and Fred. Walker. It is different from Millet, but
    you will see, however long you look at it, it never bores
    you.</p>

    <p>Don't throw it away, for one so seldom sees something of
    that rare art, which one must not mistake for Bridgmann, for
    instance.</p>

    <p>And the other little print, though less virile in
    conception, is mighty good as to sentiment and also quite
    original.</p>

    <p>Every day I work hard on drawing figures. But I must have a
    hundred of them, even more, before I am through. I want to find
    something different from my old drawings and to grasp the
    character of the peasants - especially those from this
    neighbourhood.</p>

    <p>And it is about harvest time, and then I must make a
    campaign both of corn reaping, and potato digging. At that time
    it is twice as hard to get models, and yet it is necessary, for
    I become more and more convinced that one cannot be too
    conscientious, that one must always exert oneself on what
    Daudet calls &ldquo;the search for the model&rdquo; (in
    L'Histoire de mon Livre, an article about &ldquo;Les rois en
    exil,&rdquo; which I just read).</p>

    <p>I should like to show Serret the studies of the harvest too.
    Therefore I cannot tell exactly when I shall be able to send
    the portfolio with studies from the model. But at all events it
    will be soon. I also hope to send before the harvest about
    three more cottages, <art id=0083>painted studies</art>, like those last ones. Am
    I wrong when I think there is some good in <art id=0084>the old tower</art>? Have
    you already varnished it?</p>

    <p>Both are now dry enough for a little varnish, and <i>need it
    badly</i>, because both are painted over something else. Can
    you fix the time of your coming approximately? And are there no
    new Lhermittes? Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I repeat, there are only too many examples of the very
    bright painters later becoming chalky or oily; it is because I
    noticed this so often that I have certain reservations, that I
    cannot altogether admire Uhde's picture. &ldquo;The Two
    Blacksmiths&rdquo; by Raffaelli is very beautiful.</p>
