  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Yesterday evening I received de Goncourt's book. I began to
    read it at once, and though of course I shall read it over
    again quietly, this morning I already had a general view of the
    whole - I had been longing for it so much. I do not think he
    praises Boucher too much.</p>

    <p>If I knew nothing of Boucher but the contrast of those three
    things, a rich blue (sky), a bronze (man's figure), and a
    mother-of-pearl white (woman's figure) especially together with
    that anecdote of &ldquo;La Duchesse d'Orleans,&rdquo; I would
    admit that he is a <i>personality</i> in the world of painters.
    Besides, he doesn't praise him too much, because he certainly
    also calls him canaille, in the way in which one may call the
    pictures by Bouguereau, Perrault, etc., canaille without doing
    an injustice to the honest fellows. Because they miss something
    touching and intimate, don't they? In my opinion he does not
    praise Boucher too much, because I do not fear for a single
    moment that de Goncourt would deny the superiority of, for
    instance, Rubens. Rubens who was even more productive than
    Boucher, not less than he, but even more so, as a painter of
    nude women.</p>

    <p>Which very often in Rubens does not prevent the poignant
    pathos and intimacy I mean, especially in those portraits of
    his wives, in which he is then himself, or surpasses
    himself.</p>

    <p>But <i>Chardin</i>!</p>

    <p>I have often longed to know something about the <i>man</i>
    (Watteau was just as I expected).</p>

    <p><i>Tiers &eacute;lat</i>, Corot-like as to bonhomie - with
    more sorrow and adversity in his life.</p>

    <p>It is a splendid book. Latour-witty and Voltaire-like.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">Pastel is a process which I should like to know. I shall
    certainly try it someday. If one can paint a head, one ought to
    be able to learn it in a few hours.</label></p>

    <p>I enjoyed immensely what he says about Chardin's technique.
    I am more convinced than ever that the true painters did not
    finish their things in the way which is used only too often,
    namely correct when one scrutinizes it closely.</p>

    <p>The best pictures, and, from a technical point of view the
    most complete, seen from near by, are but patches of colour
    side by side, and only make an effect at a certain
    distance.</p>

    <p>That is what Rembrandt stuck to, notwithstanding all the
    trouble it caused him (the honest citizens greatly preferred
    Van der Helst, because his work can also be looked at up
    close).</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">In that respect Chardin is as great as Rembrandt.
    Isra&euml;ls is the same, and I for my part think Isra&euml;ls
    always admirable, especially in his technique. It would be too
    good if everybody knew this, and thought like this, as
    <i>Bonnemort</i> would say.</label></p>

    <p>But to work like that one must be something of a magician,
    to learn which costs a great deal, and the sad sarcastic saying
    of Michelangelo's: &ldquo;Ma mani&egrave;re est destin&eacute;e
    a faire de grands sots&rdquo; - is also true of the colourists
    who dare dash on their colours, this too cannot be imitated by
    cowards and weaklings.</p>

    <p>I think that I am making progress with my work. Last night
    something happened to me which I will tell you as minutely as I
    can. <art id=0044>You know those three pollard oaks at the bottom of the
    garden at home; I have plodded on them for the fourth time.</art>
    I had been at them for three days with a canvas
    the size of, let's say, that cottage, and the country
    churchyard which you have.</p>

    <p>The difficulty was the tufts of havana leaves, to model them
    and give them form, colour, tone. Then in the evening I took it
    to that acquaintance of mine in Eindhoven, who has a rather
    stylish drawing room, where we put it on the wall (grey paper,
    furniture black with gold). Well, never before was I so
    convinced that I shall make things that do well, that I shall
    succeed in calculating my colours, so that I have it in my
    power to make the right effect. This was havana, soft green and
    white (grey), even <i>pure</i> white, direct from the tube (you
    see that I, for my part, though I speak about black, have no
    prejudice against the other extreme, even the utmost
    extreme).</p>

    <p>Now, though that man has money, though he took a fancy to
    it, I felt such a glow of courage when I saw that it was good
    that, as it hung there, it created an atmosphere by the soft
    melancholy harmony of that combination of colours <i>that I
    could not sell it</i>.</p>

    <p>But as he had a fancy for it, I gave it to him, and he
    accepted it just as I had intended, without many words, namely
    little more than, &ldquo;The thing is damned good.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I don't think so yet myself. First I must see a little more
    of Chardin, Rembrandt, old Dutch and French painters, and think
    it over well - because I want to make it more elaborate with
    less paint than I used, for instance, in this thing.</p>

    <p>Now as to that acquaintance of mine and his opinion of
    pictures; when someone with a clear intelligent head paints
    still life and works out-of-doors every day, if only for a
    year, he need not therefore be an art critic, neither does he
    feel he is a painter yet, but for all that he will observe more
    originally than many others.</p>

    <p>Besides, his character is not just like everybody's, for
    instance, he was originally intended to become a priest, at a
    certain moment he flatly refused this, <i>and carried his
    point</i>, in which not exactly every one in Brabant succeeds.
    And there is something broad-minded and loyal about him.</p>

    <p>Zola once referred to this something in a conversation
    between Mouret and his school-fellow, when he let Mouret get
    serious and say that it had cost him a great deal to free
    himself from that time and its influence, but that he had
    wanted to <i>live</i> and that he had <i>lived</i>. Many who
    undertake to change fall back, don't come any further than a
    certain insipid methodism because they don't take their
    measures energetically enough. But this is not the case with
    him, he is a <i>man of importance</i> in his little world.</p>

    <p>Do you know that the de Goncourts have made etchings and
    drawings? You must not think me unpractical when I persist in
    encouraging you either to draw or to paint. You wouldn't be a
    failure either. If you just set yourself to it, the result
    would not be unsatisfactory either. And especially as an art
    <i>dealer</i>, especially as an <i>art expert</i>, it would
    give you an edge over many others. An edge which one really
    needs.</p>

    <p>I refer once more to that acquaintance of mine; it is
    exactly a year ago that I saw him for the first time, when I
    made that <art id=0125>large sketch of a water mill</art> which
    you perhaps know (its colour is ripening well). Herewith a
    description of a study by that acquaintance of mine - some
    roofs, backs of houses, factory chimneys, dark against an
    evening sky. That evening sky blue, changing at the horizon
    into a glow between clouds of smoky colour, with orange or
    rather ruddy reflections. The masses of houses, dark yet of a
    warm stone colour, a silhouette that has something gloomy and
    threatening. The foreground, a vague plot in the dusk, black
    sand, faded grass, a bit of garden with a few dark melancholy
    apple trunks, with here and there a tuft of yellow autumn
    leaves.</p>

    <p>It was all his idea alone, but isn't it a good conception, a
    real <i>impression</i>, well felt? But one doesn't become a
    <i>painter</i> in one year, nor is it necessary.</p>

    <p>But there is already one good thing among the lot, and one
    feels hopeful, instead of feeling helpless before a stone
    wall.</p>

    <p>I do not know how I shall fare in the future. At present
    when I read of that splendid devil, that famous Latour, by
    <i>God</i>, how real it is, and how well that fellow, except
    for his enormous passion for money, has attacked life and
    painting.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Only <i>recently</i> I saw Frans Hals. Well, you know how
    enthusiastic I was about it, how I immediately wrote you a long
    letter about painting in one stroke. How great is the
    similarity between the ideas of Latour, for instance, and Frans
    Hals, when they express life with pastel which one could almost
    blow <i>off</i>. I don't know what I shall do and how I shall
    fare, but I hope not to forget the lessons which I am thus
    learning these days: <i>in one stroke</i> - but with absolutely
    complete exertion of one's whole spirit and attention.</label></p>

    <p>At present - I like nothing better than working with the
    brush, drawing with it too - instead of making a sketch in
    charcoal.</p>

    <p>When I ask myself how the old Dutch masters worked, I find
    so relatively few real drawings. And how wonderfully they draw.
    But - I think in most cases they began, continued and finished
    with their brush.</p>

    <p>They did not <i>fill in</i>.</p>

    <p>A Van Goyen, for instance - I just saw that one of his in
    the Dupper Collection, an oak tree on a dune in the storm; and
    the Cuyp, view of Dordrecht.</p>

    <p>An astonishing technique, but done with nothing and quite
    naturally - clear of paint, and - apparently - quite
    simple.</p>

    <p>But either in figure or in landscape, how the painters
    always did try to convince people that a picture is something
    different from nature in a mirror, different from imitation,
    i.e. re-creation.</p>

    <p>I should like to tell you a great deal more, especially
    about what Chardin made me think about colour and that not
    painting the local colour. I think it splendid.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Comment surprendre - comment dire de quoi est faite
    cette bouche d&eacute;meu-bl&eacute;e, qui a d'infinies
    d&eacute;licatesses. Cela n'est fait que de quelques
    traine&eacute;s de <i>jaune</i> et de quelques balayures de
    <i>bleu</i>!!!&rdquo; [How to surprise - how to tell what that
    toothless mouth is done with, which is so infinitely delicate.
    It is done only with some streaks of <i>yellow</i>, and some
    broad strokes of <i>blue</i>!!!]</p>

    <p>When I read this I thought of Van der Meer of Delft; if one
    sees his city view at The Hague close up, it is incredible, and
    painted with entirely different colours than one would suspect
    at a few steps' distance.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, I had to tell you at once how I admire de
    Goncourt's book.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
