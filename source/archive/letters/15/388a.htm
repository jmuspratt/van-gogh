  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am anxiously awaiting the money; I had hoped you would
    have seen your way to sending it a few days earlier.</p>

    <p>I have explained to you at great length that the painting of
    the 50 studies of heads which I intend to do leads to my
    incurring more expense than usual. And as, by your writing that
    you are suspicious of me, you yourself are the cause of this, I
    feel vexed when I think that my being embarrassed every now and
    then is to be attributed more to this than to anything else. My
    not selling anything would not worry me so much if only my work
    could be pushed forward with all possible vigour.</p>

    <p>Well, I am doing all I can, and I am making progress after
    all. You will also have to take back what you said about your
    suspiciousness. When this will be, you will have to decide for
    yourself - but I only want to say by way of caution that the
    ugliest misunderstandings are caused by suspicion.</p>

    <p>As for me, at times I feel wretched because it seems that
    your character has congealed in this mould, which I believe
    will cause you trouble later on. But what's the use of talking?
    What I mean is a family failing, as far as I can see.</p>

    <p>I always have the impression that at Zundert, and a few
    years earlier than that, there was a generally better
    atmosphere in the house. Since then, I feel it has not changed
    for the better. At present&hellip;</p>

    <p>But what I don't know is whether the former - the feeling
    that things were better in Zundert - is only my imagination;
    this may easily be the case.</p>

    <p>But at any rate, now it is not <i>it</i>.</p>

    <p>So much for that. Goodbye.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Since last summer I cannot help seeing you in my mind's eye
    wearing a pince-nez with black glasses.</p>

    <p>This does not change a man so much, you will say.</p>

    <p>Maybe not - but my impression is that, in a sense other than
    the literal one, in your actions and thoughts, you have
    procured such black eyeglasses. Suspiciousness for
    instance.</p>

    <p>But on the other hand I think it a good thing to know one's
    Paris well - if, once there, you become a Parisian through and
    through - analytical, steely, &ldquo;knowing,&rdquo; as they
    call it - I am not narrow-minded enough to condemn it. That's
    not my way. Be and remain a Parisian if you like, it's all
    right with me.</p>

    <p>There are various things in the world that are <i>great</i>
    - the sea with the fishermen - the furrows and the peasants -
    the mines and the miners.</p>

    <p><i>And in the same way I also think great</i> the sidewalks
    of Paris and the people that know their Paris.</p>

    <p>Now, however, you commit an error if on your part you are
    unable to understand that your being suspicious of me is
    positively improper. Most certainly I think differently, I feel
    differently, I act differently. But it is quite consistent when
    viewed in its proper relation.</p>

    <p>And considering that when I was in Drenthe and I advised you
    to become a painter, you wrote me that I was speaking about
    your affairs from afar and I conceded this point, the reverse
    is most certainly true too, namely that you can only make a
    wild guess about my doings here. So give up your suspicions,
    for they are simply improper. And the means must be found in
    the good progress my work is making - leaving the matter of
    more or less mutual sympathy out of the question - to be <i>at
    least inoffensive</i> to each other, however much our ways may
    run in opposite directions.</p>
