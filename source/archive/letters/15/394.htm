  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for the Illustrations you sent, I am much
    obliged to you. I think the various drawings by Renouard
    beautiful and I did not know one of them.</p>

    <p>However - this is not to give you extra trouble, but because
    I wrote things about them which perhaps cannot quite be applied
    to other drawings of his - the real Renouard composition I
    meant is not among them, perhaps that issue is sold out. The
    breadth of the figure in it was superb, it was an old man and
    some women and a child, 1 believe, sitting idle in a weaver's
    cottage where the looms stood still.</p>

    <p>I had not yet seen <i>anything</i> in reproduction from the
    Salon of '84, and now I at least got some idea of a few
    interesting pictures from the Salon number. For instance of
    that composition by Puvis de Chavannes.</p>

    <p>I imagine that the Harpignies with the setting sun must have
    been splendid. And the pictures by Feyen-Perrin which they give
    sketches of.</p>

    <p>I was also struck by the figure of a girl by Emile Levy,
    &ldquo;Japonaise,&rdquo; and the picture by Beyle,
    &ldquo;Br&ucirc;leuses de Varech&rdquo; [Women burning
    seaweed], and the one by Collin, &ldquo;L'Ete,&rdquo; three
    figures of nude women.</p>

    <p>I am very busy painting those heads. I paint in the daytime
    and draw in the evening. In this way I have already painted at
    least some thirty and drawn as many.</p>

    <p>With the result that I see a chance of doing it even better
    before long, I hope.</p>

    <p>I think that <i>it will help me for the figure in
    general</i>. Today I had one white and black against the flesh
    colour.</p>

    <p>And I am also looking for blue all the time. Here the
    peasant's figures are as a rule blue. That blue in the ripe
    corn or against the withered leaves of a beech hedge - so that
    the faded shades of darker and lighter blue are emphasized and
    made to speak by contrast with the golden tones of
    reddish-brown - is very beautiful and has struck me here from
    the very first. The people here instinctively wear the most
    beautiful blue that I have ever seen.</p>

    <p>It is coarse linen which they weave themselves, warp black,
    woof blue, the result of which is a black and blue striped
    pattern. When this fades and becomes somewhat discoloured by
    wind and weather, it is an infinitely quiet, delicate tone that
    particularly brings out the flesh colours.</p>

    <p>Well, blue enough to react to all colours in which hidden
    orange elements are to be found, and discoloured enough not to
    jar.</p>

    <p>But this is a question of colour, and what matters more to
    me at the point I'm at now is the question of form. I think the
    best way to express form is with an almost monochrome
    colouring, the tones of which differ principally in intensity
    and in value. For instance, &ldquo;La Source&rdquo; by Jules
    Breton was painted almost in one colour. But one really ought
    to study each colour separately in connection with its contrast
    before one can be positively sure of being harmonious.</p>

    <p><art id=0067>When there was snow, I also painted a few studies of our
    garden. The landscape has changed much since then; now we have
    splendid evening skies of lilac with gold over dark silhouettes
    of cottages between the masses of ruddy-coloured brushwood -
    above which rise the spare black poplars, while the foregrounds
    are of a faded and bleached green, varied by strips of black
    earth and pale withered rushes along the ditch edges</art>.</p>

    <p>I certainly see all this too - I think it just as superb as
    anybody else, but I am even more interested in the proportion
    of a figure, the division of the oval of the head, and I cannot
    master the rest before I have a better grip on the figure.</p>

    <p>Well - first comes the figure; I personally cannot
    understand the rest without it, and it is the figure that
    creates the atmosphere. I can understand, however, that there
    are people, like Daubigny and Harpignies and Ruysdael and so
    many others, who are absolutely and irresistibly carried away
    by the landscape itself; their work satisfies us fully because
    they themselves were satisfied with sky and earth and a pool of
    water and a shrub.</p>

    <p>But I think it a mighty clever saying of Isra&euml;ls, when
    he remarked of a Dupr&eacute;, It is just like &ldquo;a picture
    of the figure.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Goodbye and many thanks again for the Illustrations.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent.</p>
