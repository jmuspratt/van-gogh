  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today I sent off the small box in question, containing,
    except what I mentioned already, another picture,
    <art id=0084>&ldquo;<i>Cimiti&egrave;re de Paysans</i>.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>I have omitted some details - I wanted to express how those
    ruins show that <i>for ages</i> the peasants have been laid to
    rest in the very fields which they dug up when alive - I wanted
    to express what a simple thing death and burial is, just as
    simple as the falling of an autumn leaf - just a bit of earth
    dug up - a wooden cross. The fields around, where the grass of
    the churchyard ends, beyond the little wall, form a last line
    against the horizon - like the horizon of the sea.</p>

    <p>And now those ruins tell me how a faith and a religion
    mouldered away - strongly founded though they were - but how
    the life and the death of the peasants remain forever the same,
    budding and withering regularly, like the grass and the flowers
    growing there in that churchyard.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Les religions passent, Dieu demeure&rdquo; [Religions
    pass away, God remains], is a saying of Victor Hugo's whom they
    also brought to rest recently.</p>

    <p>I do not know if either of these two pictures will please
    you - <art id=0083>the cottage with the mossed roof</art> reminded me of a wren's
    nest. Well, just look them over.</p>

    <p>I must use this opportunity to explain once more, as I found
    new and clear words for it, why I wrote you, and write again,
    that I am far from sure that your present opinion is a definite
    conviction.</p>

    <p>The house of Goupil &amp; co. is not a good training school
    for becoming acquainted with pictures, even less so with
    painters.</p>

    <p>I tell you my opinion is that one does not even learn to
    have an independent view. To whom did they pay great honour? To
    Paul Delaroche.</p>

    <p>I need not tell you that Delaroche was one of those of whom
    very little remains; hardly anybody takes his part any
    more.</p>

    <p>Another one who will not <i>last</i>, though he is
    <i>better</i> and once or twice made something very beautiful,
    of whom little will remain also --is G&eacute;r&ocirc;me.</p>

    <p>But his &ldquo;Prisoner,&rdquo; his &ldquo;Syrian
    Shepherds&rdquo; are <i>real</i>, and I admire them just as
    much as anybody, and willingly and readily. But for the most
    part he is a second Delaroche, both are of equal value,
    considered in the framework of their time. Now what I assert
    and think most probable is that the whole situation will bore
    you more and more each year. Further, I assert that it is doing
    a bad turn to others, and especially to oneself, to let oneself
    be bored. In spite of many wise maxims I have never been able
    to believe that it may be of any practical use, or for one's
    own good, to be bored. A good many people have reformed
    themselves at the age of thirty and have changed considerably.
    Think this over in all calmness; I tell you that of all I have
    learned and heard at Goupil &amp; co.'s <i>about</i> art,
    nothing has held true. If one reverses the commonplaces which
    count there as the highest wisdom in art matters, namely
    applauding the former and present Delaroche style and maligning
    the unorthodox modern painters, I repeat, if one
    <i>reverses</i> certain sayings - one breathes a purer air. In
    short, boy, in circumstances and in business such curious
    changes are not only possible but even usual.</p>

    <p>It is odd that I doubt whether you will stay in business
    after all.</p>

    <p>You need not pay attention to this or answer it, I just tell
    you it straightway to express my idea, not to open sterile
    discussions.</p>

    <p>But it exists - that enchanted land - where one is not
    free.</p>

    <p>Well, I hope to hear soon that you have received the box,
    and whether you like the pictures.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow I am going to paint a spot in another village, also
    a cottage - in a smaller size. I found it last Sunday, on a
    long ramble made with a peasant boy to find a wren's nest.</p>

    <p>We found six of them, it was a spot that Bodmer certainly
    would have loved. And they were all nests which the young birds
    had left, so one could take them without too many scruples. It
    was so full of character, I have some more beautiful nests.
    Goodbye, write soon, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I should like you to varnish both pictures before you show
    them to Portier or Serret.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">The village churchyard especially has sunk in badly because
    at first it was a total failure - then without hesitation I
    began anew, taking it from another angle and painting early in
    the morning instead of in the evening. And the other one - that
    of the cottage - was originally a shepherd. </label>Last week the sheep
    were shorn, I saw it, it was done on a table in the barn. I am
    glad I can show Portier something quite different this
    time.</p>

    <p>For the rest I am very busy making drawings, in order to
    send you some full-size figures before long.</p>

    <p>But while I was working on those cottages - perhaps you will
    call them imitations of Michel, though they aren't - and
    looking for subjects, I found such splendid hovels that I
    cannot help painting some more variations of those
    &ldquo;peasants' nests&rdquo; which remind me so much of the
    wren's nest.</p>

    <p>Oh, beyond all doubt - whoever paints peasants nowadays and
    has his heart in this work will have part of the public on his
    side, and not the worst part - though it may not be the
    largest. But for all that, the end or second half of the month
    will prove very meager for me. But the same happens to the
    peasant boys - and yet they enjoy their lives.</p>

    <p>I wish you had been with me last Sunday when we took that
    long walk. I came home quite covered with mud, for we had had
    to wade through a brook for half an hour. But painting becomes
    stimulating and exciting to me, like hunting - in fact it
    <i>is</i> a hunt for models and beautiful spots.</p>

    <p>Once more goodbye, and best wishes. It is already late, and
    at five o'clock I must be on duty, so goodbye.</p>
