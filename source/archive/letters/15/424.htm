    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I want to tell you that I have finished a few things which I
    should like to send you.</p>

    <p>I have read the book by Bracquemond more than once, and have
    thought it over well. Though what he says about the colours
    isn't new, though after all it comes to the same thing as the
    theories discovered by Delacroix, though what he says about
    drawing - modelling is drawing, drawing is modelling - isn't
    new either, yet I have seldom read stronger expressions for
    these and other theories.</p>

    <p>Well, I like the book enormously, and it has rather
    preoccupied me. The pictures I have for you are a few still
    lifes, <art id=0116>a basket with potatoes in it</art>, fruit, <art id=0051>a brass kettle</art>,
    etc., which I made especially with regard to the modelling with different
    colours, and I should like Portier to see them. I shall send
    them to you as soon as I have some money, for it's the end of
    the month.</p>

    <p>I am curious to see the new Lhermitte, if there has been one
    this month. I ordered some colours from Schoenfeld in
    Dusseldorf, because I could not get the right ones here.</p>

    <p>That the colour of the <art id=0082>&ldquo;Potato Eaters&rdquo;</art> is not
    good is, partly at least, the paint's fault. I was reminded of
    it because I painted a large still life in which I sought
    similar tones, and as I was not satisfied with it because I
    again got the same things as before, I painted it anew. Judging
    from this experience, it would have turned out much better with
    the mineral blue I have now than with what I had before.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
