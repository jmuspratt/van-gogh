  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>By the same mail you will receive a number of copies of <art id=1661>the
    lithograph</art>. Please give Mr. Portier as many as he wants. And I
    enclose a letter for him, which I am afraid you will think
    rather long, and in consequence unpractical. But I thought that
    what I had to say couldn't be expressed in more concise terms,
    and that the chief point is to give him arguments for his own
    instinctive feelings. And in fact what I write to him I say
    also to you.</p>

    <p><i>There is a school - I believe - of impressionists. But I
    know very little about it</i>. But I do know who are the
    original and most important masters, around whom - as round an
    axis - the landscape and peasant painters will turn. Delacroix,
    Corot, Millet and the rest. That is my own opinion, not
    formulated as it should be.</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">I mean there are (rather than persons) rules or principles
    or fundamental truths for <i>drawing</i>, as well as for
    <i>colour</i>, upon which <i>one proves to fall back</i> when
    one finds out an actual truth.</p>

    <p>In drawing, for instance - that question of drawing the
    figure beginning with the circle - that is to say taking as
    one's basis the elliptical planes. A thing which the ancient
    Greeks already knew, and which will continue to apply till the
    end of the world. As to colour, those everlasting problems, for
    instance, that first question Corot addressed to
    Fran&ccedil;ais, when Fran&ccedil;ais (who already had a
    reputation) asked Corot (who then had nothing but a negative or
    rather bad reputation) when he (F) came to Corot, to get some
    information: &ldquo;Qu'est-ce que c'est un ton rompu? Qu'est-ce
    que c'est un ton neutre?&rdquo; [what is a broken tone? What is
    a neutral tone?]</label></p>

    <p>Which can be better shown on the palette than expressed in
    words.</p>

    <p>So what I want to tell Portier in this letter is my
    confirmed belief in Eugene Delacroix and the people of that
    time.</p>

    <p>And at the same time, as the picture which I have in hand is
    different from lamplights by Dou or Van Schendel, it is perhaps
    not superfluous to point out how one of the most beautiful
    things done by the painters of this country has been the
    painting of <i>black</i>, which nevertheless has <i>light</i>
    in it. Well, just read my letter and you will see that it is
    not unintelligible, and that it treats a subject that just
    occurred to me while painting.</p>

    <p>I hope to have some luck with that <art id=0082>picture of the
    potato-eaters.</art></p>

    <p>I also have on hand a red sunset.</p>

    <p>In order to paint rural life one must be master of so many
    things. But on the other hand I don't know anything at which
    one works with so much calm, in the sense of serenity, however
    much of a worry one may be having as regards material
    things.</p>

    <p>I am rather worried just now about the moving, that's no
    easy job, on the contrary. But it had to happen some time, if
    not now, then later, and in the long run it is better to have a
    place of one's own, that's a fact.</p>

    <p>To change the subject. How typical that saying is about the
    figures of Millet: &ldquo;<i>son paysan semble peint avec la
    terre qu'il ensemener&rdquo;</i> [His peasant appears to be
    painted with the earth that he is sowing.] How exact and how
    true. And how important it is to know how to mix on the palette
    those colours which have no name, and yet are the real
    foundation of everything. Perhaps, I daresay <i>for sure</i>,
    the questions of <i>colour</i>, and more exactly, broken and
    neural colours, will preoccupy you anew. Art dealers speak so
    vaguely and arbitrarily about it, I think. So in fact do
    painters too. Last week I saw at an acquaintance's a decidedly
    clever, realistic study of an old woman's head, by somebody who
    is directly, or indirectly, a pupil of the school of The Hague.
    But in the drawing, as well as in the colour, there was a
    certain hesitation, a certain narrow-mindedness, much greater,
    in my opinion, than one sees in an old Blommers or Mauve or
    Maris. And this symptom threatens to become more and more
    general. If one takes realism in the sense of <i>literal</i>
    truth, namely exact drawing and local colour. There are other
    things than that.</p>

    <p>Well, goodbye, with a handshake.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
