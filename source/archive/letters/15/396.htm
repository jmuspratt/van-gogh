    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Some of the heads I promised you are finished, but they are
    not quite dry yet. As I wrote you already, they were painted in
    a dark cottage, and they are studies in the real sense of the
    word. I already began to send you studies of drawings long
    ago.</p>

    <p>I did not intend to stop doing so.</p>

    <p>I work hard, and suppose that only one out of ten or twenty
    studies I make is worth seeing; though those few, either more
    or less in number, may be of <i>no</i> value <i>now</i>, they
    may be later on, perhaps.</p>

    <p>Not so much taken separately as in connection with other
    studies.</p>

    <p>However it may be - I will try it once more, so as soon as
    they are quite dry, and I can varnish them, I'll send you some
    heads and also a little sketch of a woman spooling yarn.</p>

    <p>And that needn't be all - seeing that I have applied myself
    almost exclusively to painting for more than a full year, I
    dare claim these to be somewhat different from the first
    painted studies I sent you.</p>

    <p>When I see, as I did recently, something like those splendid
    woodcuts by Lhermitte, I know very well that I am still far
    from doing such a thing myself. But seeing his work encourages
    me as to my views and working method, namely always directly
    from nature or in the squalid, smoke-blackened cottage. For I
    see (for instance, from details in heads, in hands) how artists
    like Lhermitte must have studied the peasant figure, not only
    from a fairly great distance, but from very close by, not now
    when they create and compose with ease and assurance, but
    before they could do so.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;On croit que j'imagine - ce n'est pas vrai - je me
    souviens,&rdquo; said one who could compose with a master
    hand.</p>

    <p>Now as for me, I cannot yet show a single <i>picture</i>,
    hardly a single <i>drawing</i> yet. But I <i>do</i> make
    studies, and that's just why I can very well imagine that the
    time might come when I shall also be able to compose easily.
    And, moreover, it is hard to say where the study ends and the
    picture begins.</p>

    <p>I am brooding over a couple of larger, more elaborate
    things, and if I should happen to get a clear idea of how to
    reproduce the effects I have in mind, in that case I should
    keep the studies in question here for the time being, because
    then I should certainly need them - it would be, for instance,
    something like this:</p>

    <p>namely figures against the light of a window.</p>

    <p><?showImage("477_V-T_3960");?>
    </p>

    <p>I have studies of heads for it, <art id=0070>against</art> the <art id=0070a>light</art> as well as
    turned toward the light, and I have worked several times
    already on the complete figure; spooling yarn, sewing, <art id=0073>or
    peeling potatoes</art>. Full face and in profile, it is a difficult
    effect.</p>

    <p>But I think I have learned a few things from it.</p>

    <p><?showImage("477_V-T_3961");?>
    </p>

    <p>Goodbye, I couldn't put off writing to you again.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
