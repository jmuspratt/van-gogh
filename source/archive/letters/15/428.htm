  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today I received your letter with enclosure. I was very
    pleased with your letter, because I noticed a few things in it
    which I want to talk over. To begin at the beginning; what you
    write about a certain study of a basket with apples is very
    well observed, but does this observation come from yourself???
    because I fancy, I should almost say <i>I am sure</i>, that you
    used not to see that kind of thing: However this may be, here
    we are on our way to agreeing more about the colours.</p>

    <p>Go more deeply into <i>those</i> questions, for that will be
    useful to you, and those are the things that Burger and Mantz
    and Silvestre knew.</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">Just to explain how that study was painted - simply this:
    green and red are complementary colours. Now in the apples
    there is a red which is very vulgar in itself; further, next to
    it some greenish things. But there are also one or two apples
    of another colour, of a certain pink which makes the whole
    thing right.</p>

    <p>That pink is the broken colour, got by mixing the
    above-mentioned red and the above-mentioned green. That's why
    there is harmony between the colours.</p>

    <p>Added to this is a second contrast, the background forms a
    contrast to the foreground, the one is a neutral colour, got by
    mixing blue with orange; the other, the same neutral colour
    simply changed by adding some yellow.</label></p>

    <p>But I am awfully glad that you notice a combination of
    colour, be it through direct or indirect personal perception.
    Further, that one of the studies seemed to you a variation on
    the brown-grey theme, well, that certainly is the case, but all
    three potato studies are like that, with this difference, that
    one is <art id=0118>a study in terre de Sienne</art>, <art id=0107>the second in terre de
    Sienne br&ucirc;l&eacute;e</art>, the <art id=0116>third in yellow ochre and red
    ochre.</art></p>

    <p>The latter - that is the largest one - is in my opinion the
    best - notwithstanding the dull black background which I
    purposely left dull because the ochres are also naturally
    non-transparent colours. As to that study, the largest one of
    the potatoes, it is made by changing, by breaking, those
    untransparent ochres with a transparent blue. As red ochre with
    yellow ochre gives orange, their combination with blue is more
    neutral, and against that neutralized colour, they become
    either more red or more yellow.</p>

    <p>The highest light in that whole picture is simply some pure
    yellow ochre. The reason why this dull yellow stands out so is
    because it is put in a wide field of, be it neutral, violet;
    because... red ochre with blue gives violet tones.</p>

    <p>Well, <art id=0112>the </art><art id=0108>birds'</art><art id=0110> nests</art> were also purposely painted against a
    black background, because I want it to be obvious in these
    studies that the objects do not appear in their natural
    surroundings, but against a conventional background.
    A <i>living</i> nest in nature is quite different - one hardly sees the nest itself,
    one sees the birds.</p>

    <p>But when one wants to paint nests from one's <i>collection
    of nests</i>, one cannot express strongly enough the fact that
    the background and the surroundings in nature are quite
    different, therefore I simply painted the background black. But
    it is a fact that in a still life a coloured background can be
    beautiful - in Amsterdam I saw still lifes by Miss Vos that
    were <i>excellent</i>, much more beautiful than those by
    Blaisse Desgoffe [a French still-life painter of the
    mid-nineteenth century] - really like Van Beyeren. I couldn't
    help thinking that those simple still lifes of hers had far
    more artistic value than many pretentious pictures by other
    Amsterdam painters.</p>

    <p>They struck me as very well done. Especially one with a
    golden vase, a few empty oyster shells, a broken coconut shell
    and a crust of bread. I will send you the book by Blanc; I hope
    soon to get L'art auXVIIIme Si&egrave;cle; I am especially
    longing to hear something from de Goncourt about Chardin.
    Lacaze's Rembrandt is really also in the sentiment of
    Rembrandt's last period; it is about twelve years since I saw
    it, but I still remember it because it struck me, just like
    that head by Fabritius in Rotterdam. If I remember correctly,
    that nude woman in the Lacaze Collection is also very
    beautiful, also of a later period. The fragment, Rembrandt's
    <art id=anatless>&ldquo;Lesson in Anatomy,&rdquo;</art> yes, I was absolutely
    staggered by that too. Do you remember those flesh colours - it
    is - <i>de la terre</i> - especially the feet.</p>

    <p>You know, Frans Hals's flesh colours are also earthy, used
    here in the sense that you know. Often at least. Sometimes, I
    almost dare say always, there is also a relation of contrast
    between the tone of the costume and the tone of the face. Red
    and green are opposites; &ldquo;The Singer&rdquo; (Dupper
    Collection), who has tones of carmine in the flesh colour, has
    tones of green in his black sleeves, and ribbons on those
    sleeves <i>of a red other</i> than that carmine. The
    orange-white-blue fellow I wrote about has a relatively neutral
    complexion, earthy-pink, violetish, in contrast with his
    Frans-Hals-yellow leather suit.</p>

    <p>The yellow fellow, citron amorti, decidedly has dull violet
    in his mug. Well - the darker the costume, the lighter the face
    is sometimes - not accidentally - at least his portrait and
    that of his wife in the garden contain <i>two</i> blackish
    violets (blue-violet and reddish-violet) and a plain black
    (yellow-black?). I repeat, reddish-violet and blue-violet,
    black and black, the three gloomiest things, as it were; well,
    the faces are <i>very</i> fair, <i>extremely</i> fair, even for
    Hals.</p>

    <p>Well. Frans Hals is a colourist <i>among colourists</i>, a
    colourist like Veronese, like Rubens, like Delacroix, like
    Vel&aacute;squez.</p>

    <p>Of Millet, Rembrandt and, for instance, Isra&euml;ls, it has
    truly been said that they are more harmonists than colourists.
    But tell me, <i>black</i> and <i>white</i>, may they be used or
    may they not, are they forbidden fruit?</p>

    <p>I don't think so; Frans Hals has no less than twenty-seven
    blacks. White - but you know yourself what striking pictures
    some modern colourists make of white on white. What is the
    meaning of that phrase: <i>one must not</i>? Delacroix called
    them <i>rests</i>, used them as such. You must not have a
    prejudice against them, for if used only in their places, and
    in harmony with the rest, one may of course use all tones.</p>

    <p>I can tell you that I often think the things by Apol, for
    instance, white on white, very well done. His sunset in The
    Hague Wood, for instance, which is in Amsterdam. That thing is
    damn good indeed.</p>

    <p>No - black and white have their reason and significance, and
    when one tries to suppress them, it turns out wrong; to
    consider both <i>neutral</i> is certainly the most logical
    thing to do, white - the highest combination of the lightest
    red, blue, yellow; black - the highest combination of the
    darkest red, blue, yellow. I have nothing to say against that
    theory, I find it perfectly true. Well, <i>light</i> and
    <i>brown</i>, the <i>tone</i> in its <i>value</i> stands in
    direct relation to that 4th color scale from <i>white to
    black</i>. For one finds there:</p>

    </table>

    <p>That is how I understand the blacks and the whites.</p>

    <p>When I mix red with green to a red-green or green-red, by
    mixing it with white, I then get pink-green or green-pink. And
    if you like, by adding black, I get brown-green or green-brown.
    Isn't that clear? When I mix yellow with violet to a
    violet-yellow or yellow-violet, in other terms a neutralized
    yellow or a neutralized violet, by adding white and black, I
    get greys.</p>

    <p>Well, <i>greys</i> and <i>browns</i>, there is especially
    question of them when one makes colours <i>lighter</i> or
    <i>darker</i>, whatever their nature and their gradation of
    red, yellow or blue may be.</p>

    <p>It is quite correct to speak of light and dark grays and
    browns, I think. But how beautiful what Silvestre says about
    Delacroix is - that he put a fortuitous tone on his palette,
    <i>une nuance innommable violac&eacute;e</i>, that he put that
    one tone down somewhere, <i>either for highest light or for
    deepest shadow</i>, but that of this <i>mud</i> he made
    something which either sparkled like light or was gloomily
    silent like a deep shadow.</p>

    <p>So I have heard of an experiment with a sheet of neutral
    coloured paper - which became greenish against a red
    background, reddish on a green one, bluish on orange, orange on
    blue, yellowish on violet, and violetish on yellow.</p>

    <p>Just listen, suppose one wants such a <i>muddy tone</i> or
    <i>drab colour</i> to become <i>light</i> in the picture, like
    Delacroix said of Veronese, that he could paint a blonde nude
    woman with a colour like mud in such a way that she comes out
    fair and blonde in the picture - then the question arises - how
    is this possible, unless by contrast of great forces in
    bluish-blacks or violets, or reddish-browns?</p>

    <p>You - who are looking for dark shadows somewhere, and think
    that when the shadows are dark, aye, black, that it is all
    wrong then, is this right? I don't think so. For then, for
    instance, the &ldquo;Dante&rdquo; by Delacroix, the
    &ldquo;Fisherman of Zandvoort,&rdquo; for instance, would be
    wrong. For indeed, they contain the most vigorous blue-black or
    violet-black values. Rembrandt and Hals, didn't they use black?
    and Vel&aacute;squez???</p>

    <p>Not only one, but twenty-seven blacks, I assure you. So as
    to &ldquo;one must not use black,&rdquo; are you yourself quite
    sure that you know what you mean by it? and do you know what
    you want with it? Really, think it <i>over</i> carefully, for
    you might come to the conclusion - I think this very probable -
    that you have learned and understood that question of tones
    quite wrongly, or rather have learned it <i>vaguely</i> and
    understood it <i>vaguely</i>. Many people do, most of them do.
    But in the long run Delacroix and others of his time will teach
    you better.</p>

    <p>Tell me - have you noticed that those studies of mine that
    have black backgrounds have their <i>highest light</i> put in
    <i>a low colour scale???</i> And when in this way I put my
    study in a <i>lower colour scale</i> than nature, I yet keep
    the harmony of tones because I become darker, not only in my
    shadows, but also in the same degree <i>in my lights</i>.</p>

    <p>I painted my studies just as a kind of gymnastics, to rise
    and fall in tone, so - don't forget that I painted my white and
    gray moss literally with a mud colour and yet it looks light in
    the study.</p>

    <p>Good-by,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>These things concerning complementary colours, simultaneous
    contrast, and the neutralizing of complementals, this question
    is the first and principal one; the second is the mutual
    influence of two <i>kindred colours</i>, for instance, carmine
    on vermilion, a pink-violet on a blue-violet. The third
    question is a light blue against the same dark blue, a pink
    against a brown-red, a citron yellow against a chamois yellow,
    etc. But the first question is the most important.</p>

    <p>If you come across some good book on colour theories, mind
    you send it to me, for I too am far from knowing everything
    about it, and am searching for more every day.</p>
