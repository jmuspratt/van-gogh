  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today I forwarded carriage-paid a box marked V4 containing
    the still lifes. The <art id=0113>two</art> sketches <art id=0211>of Amsterdam</art> are
    unfortunately somewhat damaged. They got wet on the way, then the panels got warped while
    drying and dust stuck on them, etc., but I sent them to show
    you that if in an hour's time I want to dash off an impression
    somewhere, I am learning to do so in the same way as others who
    analyze their impressions, and who account for what they see.
    This is a different thing from feeling, i.e. undergoing
    impressions, there is perhaps a great difference between
    undergoing impressions and analyzing them, that is to say,
    <i>taking them to pieces and putting them together again</i>.
    But it is pleasant work to dash something off in a rush.</p>

    <p>What struck me most on seeing the old Dutch pictures again
    is that most of them <i>were painted quickly</i>, that
    these great masters, such as a Frans Hals, a Rembrandt, a
    Ruysdael and so many others - dashed off a thing from the first
    stroke and did not retouch it so very much.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">And please note this too - if it was right, <i>they left it
    as it was</i>. I have especially admired the hands by Rembrandt
    and Hals, certain hands in &ldquo;The Syndics,&rdquo; even in
    <art id=jbride>&ldquo;The Jewish Bride,&rdquo;</art> and in Frans Hals, hands that
    lived, but were not finished in the sense they demand
    nowadays.</label></p>

    <p>And heads too - eyes, nose, mouth done with a single stroke
    of the brush without any retouching whatever. Unger,
    Bracquemond have etched it well - just as it was painted - and
    one can see in their etchings the way of painting.</p>

    <p>Then, how necessary it is to look at the old Dutch pictures
    in these days! and at the French painters, Corot, Millet, etc.
    The rest might quite well be dispensed with, and it may lead
    others more astray than they think.</p>

    <p>To paint in one rush, as much as possible in one rush. What
    joy to see such a Frans Hals, how different it is from those
    pictures - there are so many of them - where everything has
    been carefully smoothed down in the same way.</p>

    <p>By chance I saw a Meissonier in the Fodor museum on the same
    day I saw old Dutch masters, Brouwer, Ostade, especially
    Terborch.</p>

    <p>Well, Meissonier does it, like they did, a very
    well-considered, well-calculated touch - but in one stroke and
    if possible correct at once.</p>

    <p>I think it better to scrape off with the knife a part that
    is wrong, and to begin anew, than to make too many
    corrections.</p>

    <p>I saw a sketch by Rubens and a sketch by Diaz almost at the
    same time; they were not alike, but what they have in common is
    the belief that colour expresses form if well applied and in
    harmony. Diaz is indeed a painter to the very marrow - and he
    is conscientious to his fingertips.</p>

    <p>The Diaz in Fodor is only sketchy, but perhaps for that very
    reason it was for me, who had not seen one for years, a great
    pleasure to see it again, and it stood up very well, even if
    one had just seen the technique of the old masters.</p>

    <p>I must refer once more to certain present-day pictures,
    which are becoming more and more numerous.</p>

    <p>About ten or fifteen years ago they started talking about
    &ldquo;brightness,&rdquo; about &ldquo;light.&rdquo; Originally
    this was right, it is a fact that beautiful things were
    produced by that system. But when this degenerates into an
    overproduction of pictures that have the same light all over
    the canvas, in all four corners - I think they call it day tone
    and local colour - is this right??? I think not. The Ruysdael
    at Van der Hoop's, the one with the mill, isn't it
    &ldquo;plein-air,&rdquo; isn't it enormously full of space? And
    yet the whole picture is in a much darker colour scheme than
    people would use now; besides, earth and sky form one whole,
    belong together.</p>

    <p>Van Goyen, that Corot of the Dutch, I stood a long time
    before that superb picture in the Dupper collection, two oak
    trees on a dune in autumn, in the storm. A sentiment, let me
    say, like Jules Dupr&eacute; or &ldquo;Le Buisson.&rdquo; But
    there is more common yellow ochre than white in the
    picture.</p>

    <p>There is Cuyp - a view of Dordrecht in Van der Hoop's
    collection, it is quite <i>reddish</i>-gold - the ochres are
    there too.</p>

    <p>The picture by Frans Hals, you may call it what you like;
    citron amorti or jaune chamois, what is it done with? In the
    picture it seems very light, but just put white against it.</p>

    <p>I think a great lesson taught by the old Dutch masters is
    the following: to consider drawing and colour one, which
    Bracquemond also says. And this many painters do not do, they
    draw with everything except a healthy colour. Oh, Theo, it is
    such a nuisance, it is such a bore to listen to a fellow like
    Haverman when he talks about &ldquo;technique&rdquo;; I do not
    mean Rappard, because though he too talks that way, fortunately
    for him he paints better than he talks.</p>

    <p>I don't care at all to make many friends in the painters'
    club, but I repeat - speaking of technique, there is a good
    deal more healthy, sound technique in Isra&euml;ls, for
    instance in that very old picture, &ldquo;The Fisherman of
    Zandvoort,&rdquo; with its splendid chiaroscuro, than in the
    technique of those who are always equally smooth everywhere,
    flat and distingu&eacute; in their sheet-iron frigid colour.
    You may safely put that &ldquo;Fisherman of Zandvoort&rdquo;
    beside an old Delacroix - &ldquo;La Barque du Dante,&rdquo; it
    is of one and the same family.</p>

    <p>Those are the things which I believe in, but every day I
    hate more and more those pictures which are light all over. It
    is a bad thing for me when they say that I have &ldquo;no
    technique&rdquo;; it is possible that this will blow over, as I
    make no acquaintances among the painters; it is true that, on
    the contrary, <i>those who talk most about technique</i> are in
    my eyes weakest in it!</p>

    <p>I wrote you so already. But when I show something of my work
    in Holland, I know beforehand what will be said, and by what
    kind of critics. Meanwhile I am going quietly to the <i>old
    Dutch masters</i>, and to the pictures by Isra&euml;ls, and to
    those who have a direct affinity with Isra&euml;ls, which the
    modern painters do not have. They are almost diametrically
    opposed to Isra&euml;ls.</p>

    <p>And I think I have noticed that Isra&euml;ls himself, and
    Mans, Mauve, Neuhuys, too, look disapprovingly on a certain
    tendency which we are talking about now. Mesdag, for instance,
    who was at first very <i>realistic</i>, as you remember, has
    become in his later pictures and drawings deeper of tone and
    often somewhat more mysterious.</p>

    <p>Witkamp has many good points, is rather like Jules Breton or
    Bastien Lepage, but Jules Breton is warm and he <i>is far too
    cold</i>. And that's a fault not easily remedied, to
    get some warmth into a thing, it must be put in from the very
    beginning, otherwise one cannot get rid of the coldness.</p>

    <p>What they call brightness is in many cases an ugly studio
    tone of a cheerless city studio. The dawn in the morning or the
    twilight in the evening does not seem to exist, there only
    seems to be midday, from 11 to 3, a very decent hour indeed,
    but - often insipid as a milksop.</p>

    <p>But for all that, Theo - I am damned hard up at present.
    Painting hard is very expensive, I am almost without a cent,
    and the end of the month is misery. The saying &ldquo;l'argent
    est le nerf de la guerre&rdquo; is alas also true of painting.
    In war, however, the result is nothing but misery and
    destruction, and in painting one sometimes sows, though the
    painter himself is not the man who reaps.</p>

    <p>How are you, and how is business? I do not know if I am
    right, but judging from the show window, the shop in Amsterdam
    did not look very flourishing, but oh so quiet and
    respectable.</p>

    <p>Indeed, too much courage and enthusiasm are not the
    faults(?) of today. I have hardly spoken to anybody, but
    indirectly I sounded people out here and there, because I am
    curious to see the art trade's results and what will become of
    it. I don't think you are exactly overwhelmed with pictures -
    are you?</p>

    <p>This winter I am going to study several things of great
    technical skill which I noticed in the old masters. I have seen
    much that is of use to me. But above all things - what is
    called <i>enlever</i>, that is what the old Dutch
    masters did famously.</p>

    <p>That enlever in a few strokes of the brush, they won't hear
    of it nowadays, but how excellent the results are, and how
    masterfully this was understood by many French painters, by
    Isra&euml;ls too.</p>

    <p>In the museum I was thinking continually of Delacroix, why?
    Because standing before Hals, before Rembrandt, before Ruysdael
    and others, I was constantly reminded of the saying:
    &ldquo;Lorsque Delacroix peint, c'est comme le lion qui devore
    le morceau.&rdquo; That is how it ought to be, and oh, Theo,
    when I think of what I will call the technical club, as they
    call themselves, how dull it is. If at any time I should come
    into contact with one of those gentlemen or meet one of them,
    you may be sure I shall play the fool, but <i>&agrave; la
    vireloque</i> <sup>1</sup> with a <i>coup de dents</i> [bite]
    afterward.</p>

    <p>I hate it when things drag and go amiss.</p>

    <p>And isn't it a fatal thing, that forced finishing everywhere
    (what they <i>call</i> finish), everywhere that same monotonous
    grey instead of light and brown; colour - local colour -
    instead of tone, isn't it deplorable and yet isn't it so.</p>

    <p>I find all these things wrong because I consider
    Isra&euml;ls, for instance, such a master, and because there
    are so many modern as well as old painters whom one can
    admire.</p>

    <p>I ought to have noticed before this that I am very probably
    boring you with this letter. But the fact is, I didn't think of
    it. For my part, I can tell you that I wish you would write me
    your impressions of things in the Louvre, or Luxembourg, or
    anywhere else.</p>

    <p>Write soon if you can, and let me tell you that the end of
    the month is very hard. But I am glad to have been in
    Amsterdam, though it was at a moment when I could less afford
    the expenses than ever. The consequence is that around New
    Year's I shall be very hard up, but, oh well, faint heart never
    won fair lady and for the sake of painting, I will put up with
    always being in difficulties if it has to be.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, I hope you will get my parcel in good order. There
    is a book by de Goncourt about <i>Chardin</i>, <i>Boucher,
    Watteau,</i> and <i>Fragonard</i>; I must read that; have you
    got it or one of your friends perhaps? I am afraid not, but do
    you happen to know if it is very important?</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

        <p>I.e. on a reciprocal basis, by which Vincent means:
        casting the other one for the same part.</p>
