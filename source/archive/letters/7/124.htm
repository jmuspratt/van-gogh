    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I enclose a note in Father's letter. I, too, am eager to
    hear from you again. I certainly hope that you are getting on
    as well as possible in Paris, and that you see and hear many
    interesting things.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I just received a postcard from the Reverend Mr. Pietersen;
    about the middle of August I shall have to go to Brussels. But
    as no date has been fixed and as Father and Mother think it
    better for me to stay until Anna's wedding, I shall wait until
    all that is over and then start for Brussels.</label> The other day I
    made a little drawing after &Eacute;mile Breton's &ldquo;A
    Sunday Morning,&rdquo; in pen and ink and pencil. How I like
    his work! Has he made anything new this year? Do you see much
    of his work? Yesterday and today I wrote a composition on the
    parable of the mustard seed and it is 27 pages long; I hope
    there is some good in it. As you can imagine, Father and I walk
    about the parish a great deal, or to De Hoeve and De Leur, and
    I also take many a long walk across the heath with Cor.</p>

    <p>Of course I am very curious to know how it will be in
    Brussels. I hope the work may prove successful and be
    blessed.</p>

    <p>The fields here are so beautiful now; they are reaping the
    wheat, and the potatoes are getting ripe and their leaves
    beginning to wither, and the buckwheat is full of beautiful
    white blossoms.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, I am writing to you by the light of a little
    lantern, and the candle is getting too short. &Agrave; Dieu,
    have a good time, and if you can, tell me something about the
    painters whenever you hear something interesting about one of
    them; but best of all, I shall enjoy hearing any of your own
    impressions. Good night, a warm handshake in thought from</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
