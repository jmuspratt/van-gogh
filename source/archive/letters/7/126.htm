  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>On the evening of the day we spent together, which passed
    only too quickly for me, I want to write to you again. It was a
    great joy for me to see you again and to talk with you, and it
    is a blessing that such a day, that passes in a moment, and
    such a joy that is of so short duration, stays in our memory
    and will never be forgotten. When we had taken leave I walked
    back, not along the shortest way but along the tow-path. Here
    are workshops of all kinds that look picturesque, especially in
    the evening with the lights, and to us who are also labourers
    and workmen, each in his sphere and in the work to which he is
    called, they speak in their own way, if we only listen to them,
    for they say: Work while it is day, the night cometh when no
    man can work.</p>

    <p>It was just the moment when the street cleaners came home
    with their carts with the old white horses. A long row of these
    carts were standing at the so-called Ferme des Boues, at the
    beginning of the tow-path. Some of these old white horses
    resemble a certain old aquatint engraving, which you perhaps
    know, an engraving that has no great art value, it is true, but
    which struck me, and made a deep impression upon me. I mean the
    last from that series of prints called &ldquo;The Life of a
    Horse.&rdquo; It represents an old white horse, lean and
    ema-ciated, and tired to death by a long life of heavy labour,
    of too much and too hard work. The poor animal is standing on a
    spot utterly lonely and desolate, a plain scantily covered with
    withered dry grass, and here and there a gnarled old tree
    broken and bent by the storm. On the ground lies a skull, and
    at a distance in the background a bleached skeleton of a horse,
    lying near a hut where lives a man who skins horses. Over the
    whole is a stormy sky, it is a cold, bleak day, gloomy and dark
    weather.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.death">It is a sad and very melancholy scene, which must strike
    everyone who knows and feels that we also have to pass one day
    through the valley of the shadow of death, and &ldquo;que la
    fin de la vie humaine, ce sont des larmes ou des cheveux
    blancs.&rdquo; [the end of human life is tears or white hairs.]
    What lies beyond this is a great mystery that only God knows,
    but He has revealed absolutely through His word that there is a
    resurrection of the dead.</label></p>

    <p>The poor horse, the old faithful servant, is standing there
    patiently and meekly, yet bravely and unflinchingly; like the
    old guard who said, &ldquo;la garde meurt mais elle ne se rend
    pas,&rdquo; [the guard dies, but never surrenders] it awaits
    its last hour. Involuntarily I was reminded of that engraving,
    when I saw tonight those horses of the ash carts.</p>

    <p>As to the drivers themselves with their filthy dirty
    clothes, they seemed sunk and rooted still deeper in poverty
    than that long row or rather group of paupers, that Master de
    Groux has drawn in his &ldquo;Bench of the Poor.&rdquo; It
    always strikes me, and it is very peculiar, that when we see
    the image of indescribable and unutterable desolation - of
    loneliness, of poverty and misery, the end of all things, or
    their extreme, then rises in our mind the thought of God. At
    least this is the case with me and does not Father also say:
    &ldquo;There is no place where I like better to speak than in a
    churchyard, for there we are all on equal ground; not only
    that, there we always <i>realize</i> it.&rdquo; I am glad that
    we had time to see the museum together and especially the work
    of de Groux and Leys, and so many other interesting pictures,
    like that landscape of Cooseman's for instance. I am very
    pleased with the two prints you gave me, but you ought to have
    accepted from me that small etching, &ldquo;The Three
    Mills.&rdquo; Now you have paid it all yourself, and not
    allowed me to pay half as I wished to do. But you must keep it
    for your collection, for it is remarkable, even though the
    reproduction is not so very good. In my ignorance, I should
    ascribe it rather to Peasant Breughel than to Velvet
    Breughel.</p>

    <p>I enclose the little hasty sketch, &ldquo;Au
    Charbonnage.&rdquo; I should like to begin making rough
    sketches from some of the many things that I meet on my way,
    but as it would probably keep me from my real work, it is
    better not to begin. As soon as I came home I began a sermon
    about the &ldquo;barren fig tree,&rdquo; Luke xiii 6-9.</p>

    <p>That little drawing &ldquo;Au Charbonnage&rdquo; is nothing
    specially remarkable, but the reason I made it is that one
    sees here so many people that work in the coal mines, and they
    are rather a characteristic kind of people. This little house
    stands not far from the road; it is a small inn attached to the
    big coal shed, and the workmen come there to eat their bread
    and drink their glass of beer during the lunch hour.</p>

    <p>When I was in England I applied for a position as
    Evangelist among the miners in the coal mines, but they turned
    me down, stating that I had to be at least twenty-five years
    old. You know how one of the roots or foundations, not only of
    the Gospel, but of the whole Bible is, &ldquo;Light that rises
    in the darkness,&rdquo; <i>from darkness to light</i>. Well,
    who will need this most, who will be open to it? Experience has
    taught that those who walk in the darkness, in the centre of
    the earth, like the miners in the black coal mines for
    instance, are very much impressed by the words of the Gospel,
    and believe it too. Now there is in the south of Belgium, in
    Hainault, in the neighbourhood of Mons, up to the French
    frontiers, aye, even far across it, a district called the
    Borin-age, that has a special population of labourers who work
    in the numerous coal mines. In a little handbook of geography I
    found the following about them: &ldquo;The Borins (inhabitants
    of the Borinage, situated west of Mons) find their work
    exclusively in the coal mines. These mines are an imposing
    sight, 300 metres underground, into which daily descend groups
    of working men, worthy of our respect and our sympathies. The
    miner is a special Borinage type, for him daylight does not
    exist, and except on Sunday he never sees the sunshine. He
    works laboriously by a lamp whose light is pale and dim, in a
    narrow tunnel, his body bent double and sometimes he is obliged
    to crawl along; he works to extract from the bowels of the
    earth that mineral substance of which we know the great
    utility; he works in the midst of thousands of ever-recurring
    dangers; but the Belgium miner has a happy disposition, he is
    used to that kind of life, and when he descends the shaft,
    carrying on his hat a little lamp that is destined to guide him
    in the darkness, he trusts himself to God, Who sees his labour
    and Who protects him, his wife and his children.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So the Borinage is situated south of Lessines, where one
    finds the stone quarries.</p>

    <p>I should very much like to go there as an Evangelist. The
    three months' trial demanded of me by the Rev. de Jong and the
    Rev. Pietersen is almost over. St. Paul was three years in
    Arabia before he began to preach, and before he started on his
    great missionary journeys and his real work among the heathen.
    If I could work quietly for about three years in such a
    district, always learning and observing, then I should not come
    back from there without having something to say that was really
    worth hearing. I say so in all humility and yet with
    confidence. If God wills, and if He spares my life, I would be
    ready about my thirtieth year, starting out with a peculiar
    training and experience, being able to master my work better,
    and riper for it than now.</p>

    <p>I write you this again although we have already spoken about
    it many a time.</p>

    <p>There are already in the Borinage many little Protestant
    communities and certainly schools also. I wish I could get a
    position there as Evangelist in the way we spoke about,
    preaching the Gospel to the poor, that means those who need it
    most and for whom it is so well suited, and then during the
    week devoting myself to teaching.</p>

    <p>You have certainly visited St. Gilles? I too made a trip
    there, in the direction of the Ancienne Barri&egrave;re. Where
    the road to Mont St. Jean begins there is another hill, the
    Alsemberg. To the right is the cemetery of St. Gilles, full of
    cedars and evergreen, from where one has a view over the whole
    city.</p>

    <p>Proceeding further one arrives at Forest. The neighbourhood
    is very picturesque there, on the slope of the hills are old
    houses, like those huts in the dunes that Bosboom has sometimes
    painted. One sees all kinds of field labour performed there,
    the sowing of corn, the digging of potatoes, the washing of
    turnips, and everything is picturesque, even the gathering of
    wood, and it looks much like Montmartre. There are old houses
    covered with evergreen or vines, and pretty little inns; among
    the houses I noticed one was that of a mustard manufacturer, a
    certain Verkisten, his place was just like a picture by Thijs
    Mans for instance. Here and there are places where stone is
    found, so they have small quarries, through which hollowed out
    roads pass, with deeply cut wagon ruts, where one sees the
    little white horses with red tassels, and the drivers with blue
    blouses; shepherds are to be found there too, and women in
    black with white caps, that remind one of those of de Groux.
    There are some places here, thank God one finds them
    everywhere, where one feels more at home than anywhere else,
    where one gets a peculiar pristine feeling like that of
    homesickness, in which bitter melancholy plays some part; but
    yet its stimulation strengthens and cheers the mind, and gives
    us, we do not know how or why, new strength and ardour for our
    work. That day I walked on past Forest and took a side path
    leading to a little old ivy-grown church. I saw many linden
    trees there, still more interwoven, and more Gothic so to say,
    than those we saw in the Park, and at the side of the hollowed
    road that leads to the churchyard there were twisted and
    gnarled stamps and tree roots, fantastical like those Albert
    D&uuml;rer etched in &ldquo;Ritter, Tod and Teufel.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Have you ever seen a picture or rather a photograph of Carlo
    Dolci's work &ldquo;The Garden of Olives&rdquo;? There is
    something Rembrandt-esque in it; I saw it the other day. I
    suppose you know that large rough etching on the same theme
    after Rembrandt, it is the pendant of that other, &ldquo;The
    Bible Reading,&rdquo; with those two women and a cradle? Since
    you told me that you had seen the picture by Father Corot on
    that same subject, I remembered it again; I saw it at the
    exhibition of his works shortly after his death and it deeply
    appealed to me.</p>

    <p>How rich art is, if one can only remember what one has seen,
    one is never empty of thoughts or truly lonely, never
    alone.</p>

    <p>A Dieu, Theo, I heartily shake hands with you in thought.
    Have a good time, have success in your work, and meet many good
    things on your road, such as stay in our memory and enrich us,
    though apparently we possess little. When you see Mauve greet
    him for me and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>I kept this letter for a few days; the 15th of November is
    passed, so the three months have elapsed. I spoke with the Rev,
    de Jong and Master Bokma, they tell me that I cannot attend the
    school on the same conditions as they allow to the native
    Flemish pupils; I can follow the lessons free of charge if
    necessary - but this is the only privilege, - so in order to
    stay here longer I ought to have more financial means than I
    have at my disposal, for they are nil. So I shall perhaps soon
    try that plan involving the Borinage. Once I am in the country
    I shall not soon go back to a large city.</p>

    <p>It would not be easy to live without the Faith in Him and
    the old confidence in Him; without it one would lose one's
    courage.</p>
