    <p>The following article appeared in an unnamed newspaper dated
    April 12, 1922:</p>

    <p>In a miscellany signed Fr. G. from Brussels, we find in
    <i>Ons Tijdschrift</i> [Our Magazine] the following particulars
    about &ldquo;Vincent van Gogh and Master Bokma&rdquo;:</p>

    <p>Not long ago a man known as &ldquo;Master Bokma,&rdquo;
    highly respected in his circle, died in Brussels. One of the
    curious circumstances of his life - which he himself little
    realized, if at all - was that at one time he was the preceptor
    of the great Vincent van Gogh.</p>

    <p>The Training School for Evangelists, founded in 1876 by the
    Reverend Mr. N. de Jong, was first establishing itself. Master
    Bokma was the headmaster. Three pupils were in attendance, one
    of whom furnished me with the following particulars.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.appearance">One day the Reverend Mr. Van Gogh, from a small town in
    Brabant, appeared at the school and introduced a sandy-haired,
    somewhat round-shouldered young man who wanted to be a
    pupil.... He was accepted.</label></p>

    <p>Soon it appeared that - considering the nature of the school
    - he knew quite a lot already. Also, he was much respected for
    his warm-heartedness. Yet was he not a stranger in Jerusalem?
    He was teased once in a while, for example, when once he
    sketched on the blackboard cliffs and a sea-beach; on that
    occasion he flew into a rage and hit out furiously.</p>

    <p>He did not stay long. He did not know what submission was.
    He could no more finish his training as a clergyman than he
    could finish his training as Evangelist. When he was
    confronted with the task of conjugating irregular Greek verbs,
    he asked his teacher, Mendes da Costa, &ldquo;Are these horrors
    really necessary to bring rest and peace to men?&rdquo; In the
    same way, when Master Bokma asked him, &ldquo;Van Gogh, is this
    dative or accusative?" he answered, &ldquo;I really don't care,
    sir.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.masochism">Also, in those days he was always searching for some outward
    means of self-denial and self-chastisement. He never sat down
    at a table, but kept his copybook on his knees. &rdquo;Van
    Gogh, do sit down at the table when you are writing,&rdquo; the
    master would say.</p>

    <p>And Van Gogh would reply: &ldquo;Oh, don't worry, sir; this
    is good enough for me!&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>When he spoke at a meeting, he would read a long discourse
    he had already written down on paper - a thing little
    appreciated in that Flemish land.</p>

    <p>It is known that soon afterward he went to the Walloon
    country as an evangelist, labouring among the miners; he gave
    away all his clothes, so that he wore nothing more than a pair
    of trousers and a jacket; he slept on a plank.</p>

    <p>But he did not forget his fellow pupils. When he went to see
    one of them - an army conscript in Mons - he carried under his
    arm a large portfolio full of drawings of miners - all very
    stiff and wooden, he told me.</p>

    <p>Van Gogh neglected himself to such a degree that a short
    time later, when he went to see a Brussels notable with whom he
    was acquainted, the man's daughter, on opening the door,
    shrieked, &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; screamed in terror, and fled.</p>

    <p>When he went to Paris, his circle of acquaintances in
    Brussels lost track of him.</p>

    <p>[A confirmation of the preceding account was published in
    <i>De Telegraaf</i> (an Amsterdam newspaper), November 24,
    1927.]</p>

    <p>On the occasion of the Van Gogh Exhibition the Reverend
    Mr. J. Chrispeels wrote in his <i>Christelijk
    Volksblad</i> [Christian Popular Paper] the recollections
    char-acteristic of Vincent which follow. The Reverend Mr.
    Chrispeels met him in Brussels, presumably in 1878, when the
    future painter's father brought him to the Training School for
    Evangelists, consisting (if a few rooms over the Church Hall in
    Kathelijne Square. After recalling that previously Van Gogh had
    not shown too great zeal as a theological student in Holland,
    the Reverend Mr. Chrispeels, erstwhile parson at
    Maria-Hoorebeke, related:</p>

    <p>This lack of inclination for study manifested itself in
    Brussels too. Let me give an example.</p>

    <p>When we had a Dutch grammar lesson and the master asked a
    question such as, &ldquo;Van Gogh, is this the nominative or
    dative?&rdquo; the answer was, &ldquo; Oh, sir, I really don't
    care.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Another gift lay smoldering within him the art of painting.
    What he liked was ferreting out peculiarities in the Bible and
    in other books. He asked to be allowed to join the other pupils
    studying Greek, but he was refused as long as he declined to
    take lessons in other subjects, too.<label content="feelings.masochism"> By way of
    self-chastisement he never used a table when writing, but kept
    his copybook on his knees.</label> In certain ways he often made one
    think of a legalist of the Middle Ages.</p>

    <p>Once I saw him furiously indignant. The word <i>falaise</i>
    [cliff] had occurred in a French exercise. The master explained
    it to us, but Van Gogh asked, &ldquo;Sir, will you allow me to
    draw <i>une falaise</i> on the blackboard?&rdquo; The master,
    however, did not think it necessary.</p>

    <p>As soon as the lesson was over and the master gone, Van Gogh
    went to the blackboard and started drawing a cliff. A younger
    pupil tugged at Van Gogh's jacket from behind to make fun of
    him. Van Gogh sprang round with an expression on his face I
    shall never forget, and dealt his teaser such a blow that he
    did not come back for more.</p>

    <p>Oh! that face blazing with indignation and wrath!</p>

    <p>No, I shall never forget it. How deplorable that Van Gogh,
    who took a life devoted to God so seriously, could for a moment
    so forget himself! He did not stay long at the Training
    School.</p>

    <p>The Synod appointed him Evangelist at Wasmes, in the
    Borinage, in the Walloon Country, where he was to officiate in
    a small parish - in reality not more than a missionary
    post.</p>

    <p>In the meantime I had become a soldier.</p>

    <p>Once when we were exercising on the parade ground the
    sergeant called me, saying, &ldquo;There is a man to see
    you.&rdquo; The man came to me...It was Van Gogh, with a big
    portfolio under his arm. He showed me drawings intended to
    represent miners. How queer those stiff little figures
    looked!</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">He wore only the barest necessities, for he distributed
    everything, his meager wages and his clothes, among his little
    flock.</label> &ldquo;A heart of gold,&rdquo; people said. His coming
    to see me did me good.</p>

    <p>After one of his wanderings he once more came back to
    Brussels on a Sunday evening.<label content="lifestyle.appearance"> When he rang the bell at the
    house of a Protestant family here and the door was opened by
    one of the daughters of the house, she did not recognize him,
    but screamed with fright, so neglected and uncouth was his
    appearance.</label> But he was received with the most cordial
    hospitality.</p>

    <p>After this we lost sight of him. But it is known that he
    took art lessons in Brussels and Antwerp.</p>
