  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>As I feel the need to speak out frankly, <label content="psychology.depression">I cannot hide from
    you that I am overcome by a feeling of great anxiety,
    depression, a je ne sais quoi of discouragement and despair
    more than I can tell. And if I cannot find comfort, it will be
    too overwhelming.</label></p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.reclusive">I take it so much to heart that I do not get on better with
    people in general; it worries me a great deal, because so much
    of my success in carrying out my work depends on it.</label></p>

    <p><label content="feelings.guilt">Besides, the fate of the woman and the fate of my poor
    little boy and the other child cut my heart to shreds. I would
    like to help them still, and I cannot. I am at a point where I
    need some credit, some confidence and warmth, and, look here, I
    find no confidence. You are an exception, but it makes me feel
    even more how hopeless everything is just because you have to
    bear the brunt of it all.</label></p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">And if I look at my equipment, everything is too miserable,
    too insufficient, too dilapidated. We have gloomy rainy days
    here, and when I come to the corner of the garret where I have
    settled down, it is curiously melancholy there; through one
    single glass pane the light falls on an empty colour box, on a
    bundle of worn-out brushes; in short, it is so curiously
    melancholy that fortunately it also has a comical aspect,
    enough not to make one weep over it, but to take it gaily. For
    all that, it is very disproportionate to my plans, very
    disproportionate to the seriousness of my work - so here is an
    end to the gaiety.</label></p>

    <p>What can I say? Last year ended with an even greater deficit
    than I told you, for I have already paid off more than I told
    you about, <i>including Rappard</i>, but there is a new debt to
    Rappard, and that weighs on me most because he is a friend, and
    though for the moment I have paid off everything that was the
    slightest urgent, I am faced by the fact that I cannot buy
    colours because I still have to pay for the old ones, or,
    rather, I dare not take anything on credit, because after some
    time that would run up a high bill again. You know yourself how
    we were not exactly in a mood to say more during your visit,
    but now I declare to you that The Hague has been too much for
    me, and that I had put off the separation again and again, for
    one unshakable reason, even though the deficit was unavoidable
    if I persisted.</p>

    <p>Rather than part from her, I would have risked another
    effort by marrying her and going to live in the country - not,
    however, without telling you how things were. But I felt sure
    that this was the straight way, notwithstanding even temporary
    financial objections; not only might it have saved her, but it
    would also have put an end to my own great mental anguish,
    which has now unfortunately been doubled. And I would rather
    have drained the cup to the dregs.</p>

    <p>I do not say I should have been happier or unhappier if
    either Father or you had been able to feel the same way, and if
    our r&ocirc;les had been reversed, you in my place, I in yours,
    I do not know whether I should have been able to act
    differently than you have done; but I repeat, it might have
    saved her. So I look upon it as a decision which did not depend
    on you both, but on myself (except that I cannot give myself my
    father's permission to marry, this one point lies beyond my
    power, and Father replied to my direct question with
    generalities, in which no vestige of permission could be
    found).<label content="psychology.depression"> And so I <i>have</i> decided, for the very reason that
    I was already in debt, and that the future was dark - but this
    decision brings little relief, and does not remove the
    exhaustion brought about by a year of too many cares, and a
    bleeding heart and a void and feeling of disappointment and
    melancholy also remain which are not easily cured.</label></p>

    <p>It is true I am here now, and as to the finances, I have
    almost made up the deficit, and after a time I will have made
    it up entirely, and nature is beautiful here, more so than I
    expected.</p>

    <p>But I am far from being suitably and comfortably settled,
    for the glimpse I gave you of my little garret is taken from
    nature.</p>

    <p>If I had known everything beforehand, I would have gone to
    these parts with the woman last year, when she left the
    hospital; then there would have been no deficit, and then we
    should not have parted, for she is less guilty in her bad
    behaviour than her family, which has employed all kinds of mean
    intrigues, ostensibly for her benefit, but actually the
    reverse. Besides, I have sometimes wondered whether the mother
    may not have been backed by a priest, for more has been done on
    their part to influence the woman than I can explain,
    particularly because I have not heard anything from her, though
    I told her before I left that I would send my address to the
    carpenter next door as soon as I should know it myself. I did
    send it to him, begging him to pass it on to her, yet I have
    not heard anything, except from that same carpenter, that she
    had come to take away all her things (after all, more than she
    brought with her). Now you can understand that I am anxious
    about her fate, though I believe if she were simply in need,
    she would have written; but now there must be something
    basically wrong. You will understand how I feel about it. I am
    rather afraid that her family is telling her, He will certainly
    write, and then - he will be under our thumb, in short, they
    are gambling on my weakness, and I will <i>not</i> walk into
    that trap.</p>

    <p>So today I wrote, not to her, but to the carpenter, that he
    must see to it that she gets my address, but that I will
    <i>not</i> write her first, and <i>if</i> she writes, I shall
    see how things really are.</p>

    <p>I would definitely try to help her if the family disowned
    her altogether. But since she is in fact backed by her family,
    it is clear enough to me that she is in agreement with them,
    and has been for a long time, so that I may not and cannot have
    any more to do with it; or if, as I thought, there is a
    Catholic priest behind it all, she will get help, but only on
    condition that she have no dealings with me; this then being
    the reason for their silence.</p>

    <p>This much I can tell you, however - I am not yet so far that
    I can resign myself to the idea of separation; at present I am
    very, very worried about her fate, just because she has left me
    in the dark about it. And besides, these last few days I have
    been overwhelmed by forebodings about the future, and also
    about the miserable state of my stock of painting materials,
    the possibility of doing the most necessary, useful things the
    way they ought to be done. Because from the very first I have
    found so much beauty here that, if I could afford it, I would
    send for my things in The Hague, and I would fit this very same
    garret up as a studio (by making a little more light) or I
    would hunt up some other room. And then I should like to
    replenish and renew all my materials.</p>

    <p>I wish I could do that thoroughly for once, and if somebody
    would help me to do that, my greatest cares would be relieved.
    But now, either everything falls on your shoulders or I find
    nobody who trusts me; this is the circle which my thoughts
    describe, and I see no way out. A painter who has no means of
    his own cannot do without a rather large credit, a credit which
    not only the painter's profession demands, but which I think
    the shoemaker's, the carpenter's and the blacksmith's
    profession would demand equally if they wanted to establish
    themselves or had to move to a new place.</p>

    <p>It is especially this rainy weather, which we may expect to
    continue for months, which handicaps me so much.</p>

    <p>And then, what shall I say? - sometimes my thoughts go this
    way: I have worked and economized, and yet I have not been able
    to avoid getting into debt; I have been faithful to the woman,
    and yet I had to leave her; I have hated intrigues, and yet I
    have neither credit nor any money. I do not think lightly of
    your faithful help, on the contrary, but I cannot help asking
    myself if I must not tell you, &ldquo;Leave me to my fate,
    there is no help for it; it is too much for one person, and
    there is no chance of getting help from any other side. Isn't
    that proof enough that we must give it up?&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">Oh, boy, I am so melancholy - I am in a splendid country, I
    want to work, I absolutely need it - at the same time, I am
    absolutely at a loss as to how to overcome the difficulties,
    when I think that all my things are in a most miserable
    condition, and that I am here without a studio or anything, and
    shall be handicapped on all sides until I can mend matters.</label></p>

    <p>The models refuse to pose when there are other people
    around, and that is the main reason why a studio is
    necessary.</p>

    <p>I now have the very same feeling I had when I started a
    studio in The Hague: &ldquo;If I don't do it now, I shall never
    be able to manage.&rdquo; And as for The Hague, I am not sorry
    I acted then as I did; I only wish that I had come here a year
    and a half sooner, and had started a studio here instead of
    back there.</p>

    <p>Father wrote to ask if he could help me, but I have kept my
    cares to myself, and I hope that you too will not mention it to
    Father. Father has his own cares, and if he knew that I was not
    getting on well, it would worry him even more. So I wrote
    Father only that I like it here exceedingly, which is
    absolutely true as far as the scenery goes. As long as the
    weather was fine I did not mind the troubles because I saw so
    many beautiful things; but now that it has been pouring
    incessantly these last days, I see more clearly how I have got
    stuck here, and how handicapped I am. What can I do? Will it
    get better or worse in time? I do not know, but I cannot shake
    off a feeling of deep melancholy.</p>

    <p>In every life some rain <i>must</i> fall</p>

    <p>And days be dark and dreary.</p>

    <p>It is true and it cannot be otherwise, but the question is,
    isn't the number of dark and dreary days sometimes too
    great?</p>

    <p>All the same, I had models again in the barn, but with very
    unfavorable light. Well, I do not refuse to do anything that
    can be done, <i>but can I do what is necessary under the
    circumstances</i>? And this letter is a cry for more breath,
    and if this winter is the way it has been these last days, I
    should be badly off. It is beautiful, yes, very beautiful with
    the rain, but how can one work, how can one, when so many
    things are lacking?</p>

    <p>Goodbye, boy, I wish everything would come out all right,
    but we need to find more sympathy from others, otherwise I am
    afraid it won't. I hope to hear from you soon. <i>Did you
    receive the studies</i>? With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
