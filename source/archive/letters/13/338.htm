  <body>
    <p>Theo,</p>

    <p>Some time ago you wrote me about a certain difference in our
    respective physiognomies. All right. And your conclusion was
    that I was more of a thinker. What can I say to that? I do feel
    in myself a faculty for thinking, but that faculty is not what
    I feel specially organized in me. I think myself to be
    something other than specially a thinker. When I think of you,
    I see very characteristic action that is well and good, but
    also most decidedly not isolated but on the contrary
    accompanied by so much sentiment, and real <i>thought too</i>,
    that for me the conclusion is that there is more resemblance
    than difference between you and me. I do not say there is no
    difference - but having learned to know you better of late, the
    difference seems smaller to me than I used to think sometimes
    in former years.</p>

    <p>When I consider our temperament and type of physiognomy, I
    find similarity, and a very pronounced resemblance between, for
    instance, the Puritans and ourselves besides. I mean the people
    in Cromwell's time or thereabouts, the little group of men and
    women who sailed from the Old World to America in the
    <i>Mayflower,</i> and settled there, firmly resolved to live
    simple lives.</p>

    <p>Times are different - they cut down forests - we would turn
    to painting. I know that the initiative taken by a small group,
    called in history The Pilgrim Fathers, however small in itself,
    had great consequences; and as to ourselves, I think that in
    the first place we should philosophize but little about great
    consequences, and only try to find a path for ourselves to
    travel through life as straightforwardly as possible. To
    meditate on consequences is not our way, <i>neither yours nor
    mine.</i></p>

    <p>If I mention The Pilgrim Fathers, it is because of the
    physiognomy, to show you that certain reddish-haired people
    with square foreheads are neither only thinkers nor only men of
    action, but usually combine both elements. In one of Boughton's
    pictures I know a little figure of one of those Puritans, for
    which I should think <i>you</i> had posed if I didn't know
    better. It is exactly, exactly the same physiognomy - a small
    silhouette on a rock against a background of sea and fog; I can
    show you myself also, that is to say, that <i>variation</i> of
    the same physiognomy, but my profile is less
    characteristic.</p>

    <p>Father used to ponder over the story of Jacob and Esau with
    regard to you and me - not quite wrongly - but fortunately
    there is less discord, to mention only <i>one</i> point of
    difference, and in the Bible itself there are plenty of
    examples of better relations between brothers than existed
    between the venerable patriarchs mentioned above.</p>

    <p>I myself have sometimes thought about that being a thinker,
    but more and more it becomes clear to me that it was not my
    vocation, and because of the unfortunate prejudice that a man
    who feels the need to think things over is <i>not</i>
    practical, and belongs only among the dreamers, because this
    prejudice is greatly respected in Society, I often met with
    rebuffs because I didn't keep things to myself enough.</p>

    <p>But since then that very history of the Puritans, and the
    history of Cromwell, as for instance Carlyle gives it, made me
    see that thinking and acting do not exclude each other, and
    that the sharp dividing lines which are drawn nowadays between
    thinking and acting - as if the one excluded the other - do not
    really exist. As to doubting whether one is an artist or not -
    that question is too much of an abstraction.</p>

    <p>I confess, however, that I don't object to thinking it over,
    provided I can draw and paint at the same time.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">And <i>my</i> aim in <i>my</i> life is to make pictures and
    drawings, as many and as well as I can; then, at the end of my
    life, I hope to pass away, looking back with love and tender
    regret, and thinking, &ldquo;Oh, the pictures I might have
    made!&rdquo;</label> But this does not exclude making what is possible,
    mind you. Do you object to this, either for me or for
    yourself?</p>

    <p>I wish painting would become such a fixed idea in your mind
    that the problem of &ldquo;Am I an artist or am I not?&rdquo;
    would be placed in the category of abstractions, and the more
    practical questions of how to put together a figure or a
    landscape) being more amusing, would come to the fore.</p>

    <p>Theo, I declare I prefer to think how arms, legs, head are
    attached to the trunk, rather than whether I myself am more or
    less an artist or not.</p>

    <p>I suppose that you prefer thinking of a sky with grey
    clouds, and their silver lining above a muddy field, to being
    engrossed in the question of your own personality. Oh, for all
    that, I know sometimes the mind is full of it, which is only
    natural. But look here, brother, even if our mind is now and
    then full of the problem, &ldquo;<i>Is there a God</i> or <i>is
    there not</i>?&rdquo; it is no reason for us to commit an
    ungodly act intentionally.</p>

    <p>In the same way, in the matter of art, the problem,
    &ldquo;Am I an artist or am I not?&rdquo; must not induce us
    <i>not</i> to draw or <i>not</i> to paint. Many things defy
    definition, and I consider it wrong to fritter one's time away
    on them. Certainly when one's work does not go smoothly and one
    is checked by difficulties, one gets bogged in the morass of
    such thoughts and insoluble problems. And because one feels
    sorely troubled by it, the best thing to do is to conquer the
    cause of the distraction by acquiring a new insight into the
    practical part of the work.</p>

    <p>Now I, for my part, seeing both in you and in myself
    something of the Puritan character, which so unites thinking
    and acting and is so far removed from wanting to be only a
    thinker or only a machine, which needs principles of
    sim-plicity as <i>well as</i> of sensible work, I do <i>not</i>
    admit a difference or divergence, much less a contrast between
    you and me.</p>

    <p>In my view, it would be an erreur de point de vue [error of
    judgment] were you to continue in business in Paris. The
    conclusion then: two brother painters. Would that suit your
    nature? You may be involved in a difficult and fruitless
    struggle <i>against</i> it, a struggle that would impede your
    own liberation, just because you doubt whether you can do it. I
    know all this, alas, from my own experience.</p>

    <p>Apr&egrave;s tout, no matter how much we may be our own
    enemies, I am beginning to realize more and more:
    &ldquo;L'homme s'agite, Dieu le m&egrave;ne [Man proposes and
    God disposes].&rdquo; An infinitely powerful force prevails
    over our doing right and wrong. The same is true of your
    circumstances - act sensibly in them - perhaps even sensibly
    enough, in the end, to become a painter. Ultimately I should
    feel so reassured were you to take up a brush that I should
    consider the momentary calamity and shipwreck of lesser
    importance than the certain knowledge that your future is
    moving in a direction you will never regret.</p>

    <p>But I wish that at the same time you may find rest for your
    heart in the matter of women. If this were possible, you would
    be <i>even stronger</i>, as being loved gives one
    certain wings, a certain surprising courage and energy. Then
    one is more of a <i>complete</i> man than otherwise. And the
    more one is this, the better.</p>

    <p>At all events, I count it among the possibilities that you
    yourself may become conscious that painting is your vocation,
    and then, dear brother, Puritan &ldquo;sans le savoir&rdquo;
    [without knowing it], it might be that your days in Paris were
    numbered, that an old world closed itself to you, in a rather
    ungenerous way - but that at the same time a new world opened
    itself to you.</p>

    <p>Well, think it over, a long or a short time. But it would be
    of little use if you said, Vincent, keep silent about it; for
    to that my answer is: Theo, it will not keep silent <i>within
    yourself</i>.</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    On le contient plus malais&eacute;ment<br>

    Que la source des grands fleuves.<br>

    <p></p>

    [It is more difficult to repress<br>

    Than the source of great rivers.]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p><label content="feelings.guilt">Theo, I have heard from the poor woman a few times; she
    seems to be doing her best, working, washing for people, going
    out as a charwoman. Her writing is almost indecipherable and
    incoherent, she seems to regret some things in the past. The
    children are well and happy.</p>

    <p>My pity and affection for her are certainly not dead, and I
    hope that a bond of affection may remain between us, though I
    do not see the possibility or the good of living together again
    - pity may not be love, but for all that it can be rooted
    deeply enough.</label></p>

    <p>Well, brother, to change the subject, it is snowing here
    today, in the form of enormous hailstones. I call it snow
    because of the effect.</p>

    <p>I don't speak about the beauty of the scenery here because I
    should have to say <i>too much</i> about it to you. As to the
    work, I am almost too preoccupied with the idea that you should
    take it up too, which quite absorbs me. I wish it were settled,
    then we could make definite plans for working together. Drenthe
    is so beautiful, it absorbs and satisfies me so absolutely that
    if I could not be here forever, I should wish I had never seen
    it. It is inexpressibly beautiful.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
