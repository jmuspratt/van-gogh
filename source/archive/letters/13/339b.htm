  <body>
    <p>Theo, of late I have been unable to refrain from turning my
    thoughts to a few things. &ldquo;Coming events cast their
    shadows before,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We know not what a day may
    bring forth,&rdquo; as the English say. Enough, I myself have a
    presentiment that it will come to pass that you will leave
    Goupil &amp; Co. because G. &amp; Co. is unsupportably
    arrogant, and will do mean things, and in a word, they will do
    their utmost to make staying on impossible for you.</p>

    <p>At least this is the story of the honest fellow's leaving -
    those who could not stay with Goupil &amp; co., however much
    they were attached to the firm. Just wait and see how things
    turn out, but do not flatter yourself with the belief in
    reconciliation. Theo, as for me it is true that I have never
    been able to abandon the belief in reconciliation in the
    thousand occurrences of life, but my experience tells me - even
    if there is every reason to make it up, and if there is much
    harm in failing to make it up - yet my experience tells me that
    <i>in most cases</i> it does not occur.</p>

    <p>So, my dear fellow, it may well happen that one bright
    morning in the near future you will find yourself uprooted
    after a gale which suddenly assumes a huge violence, and that
    you will feel deeply shaken; my dear fellow, a thing like this
    is horrible, and may lead to your doubting whether your heart
    is in your commercial job.</p>

    <p>Then be wise, you, then be sensible, and listen to what I
    tell you about the thorny little path of painting, which at
    first leads to all sorts of humiliation, etc., but which for
    all that will eventually lead to a more lasting victory and a
    more definite peace than commerce can ever give.</p>

    <p>You and I are brothers, and what is more, friends, and if
    misfortune should happen to tighten these ties and knit us
    closer together, I should see so many favourable sides to this
    that the whole thing would appear to me anything but a
    misfortune.</p>

    <p>Theo, at times I think that for an artist the utmost poverty
    would be bearable (and productive too) if only he were not
    alone. I assure you that this presentiment that you will not
    stay on at Goupil's has remained with me all the time, since I
    wrote you for the first time: &ldquo;Coming events cast their
    shadows before,&rdquo; notwithstanding the fact that I forced
    myself to think, It will not happen; he will stay on. And at
    the same time it has become an id&eacute;e fixe of mine that
    you will feel <i>so</i> uprooted, <i>so</i> disoriented, <i>so
    defeated</i> that as for standing behind another counter you
    will simply say, &ldquo;I can't do it,&rdquo; &ldquo;It would
    certainly be a failure,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am no longer fit to be
    a dealer,&rdquo; &ldquo;It was possible at Goupil's, as I had
    been there from my youth onward, but <i>now I'll have done with
    it</i>.&rdquo; There, my presentiment tells me that this is
    approximately how you feel at heart.</p>

    <p>In this case I see nothing reckless, nothing unpractical,
    nothing foolish in our wanting to feel our energy, to feel
    <i>ourselves</i>. Let our love of art inspire us with a foi de
    charbonnier, inspire us to say what others have said before us,
    and will say after us, namely, Though circumstances may be
    ominous, and though we may be very poor, and so on, <i>yet we
    have one thing to cling to tenaciously - painting, of
    course</i>.</p>

    <p>Certainly I feel a great deal of what you say. Namely that
    in the interest of so many things you feel in your heart the
    inclination to throw yourself into business again, not
    primarily for your own pleasure but for the welfare of
    others.</p>

    <p>Dear brother, it is not at all necessary to give up your
    endeavours to keep all who belong to our home on their feet. On
    the contrary - although until now I did not think I had the
    right to put in a word - the present state of affairs induces
    me to make the proposal to divide things we are engaged in
    among all the people at home, among Father, Mother, Wil and
    Marie. And we ourselves should understand one thing thoroughly:
    that it is our duty to co-operate, and that because of the
    calamity at Goupil &amp; Co. we are faced with a number of
    years in which we must &ldquo;stoop to conquer.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>During these years we must aim at you and me in the end
    earning as much money together as you now do all alone. And
    although the interval may be something of a &ldquo;bad
    passage&rdquo; for all of us, we must try to make up for it by
    a little cordiality and love between us.</p>

    <p>I do not see any good coming of your forcing yourself to
    undertake new work against your inclination; on the contrary, I
    foresee it would end in all-round failure.</p>

    <p>But you must have <i>Foi de charbonnier</i> - and start out
    boldly with the idea: <i>Painter</i>.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">I am afraid, my dear fellow, that if you engage in new
    things, in the first place you will waste your time; in the
    second place, it will turn out a failure, because the shock of
    being uprooted will prove too strong for you, and in the third
    place you will lose more than you gain. Should you insist on
    taking this road, and once more engage in business affairs in
    Paris, America or elsewhere, I should quietly let you have your
    own way, but on the back of this page I have uttered my
    presentiments clearly enough so that you can decide for
    yourself whether I take a wrong view of things; to me it is
    pretty clear that these consequences are highly probable.</label></p>

    <p>Well, dear fellow, what I advise you is something quite new.
    Foi de charbonnier in art, instead of saying (and to me it is
    twaddle), I can't do anything, I am not an artist, do not
    attribute qualities to me that I do not possess, and all that
    rubbish. I tell you this is a delusion, and now, my dear
    fellow, things are so serious, and your future and mine are so
    terribly dependent on them that you must not take it amiss if I
    tell you a little baldly that the right thing to do under the
    circumstances is to undertake painting with the foi de
    charbonnier.</p>

    <p>And at home they must understand one thing - namely that
    whatever we do, you and I will always bear today's purpose in
    mind, which is to see things through not only for ourselves but
    for all of us. But that the old way is barred to us, and that
    we shall have to create a new one, and that what we need is
    their silence about it and their not disturbing us - on the
    contrary, their coming to our aid if there should be need for
    it. Our project ought to be respected at home, and not
    frustrated. Look here, old fellow, I cannot speak otherwise. I
    have not a moment's rest, because I must not inspire false hope
    by saying that the other things will come right.</p>

    <p>Perhaps, or rather, assuredly, we were mistaken in not
    starting on it sooner, but this mistake is understandable on
    account of our education and the influences we were submitted
    to; but this is all the more reason to get to work now with a
    steadiness and a resolution which I doubt we should have had at
    our disposal in our younger days. So it appears to me that we
    must concentrate our whole energy on painting with the utmost
    singleness of purpose - it being the raft that will take us
    safely to shore after the shipwreck - undertaking it in all
    cheerfulness.</p>

    <p>Adieu, old fellow, with a cordial handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
