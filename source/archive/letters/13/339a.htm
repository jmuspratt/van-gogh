  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>What life I think best, oh, without the least shadow of a
    doubt it is a life consisting of long years of intercourse with
    nature in the country - and Something on High - inconceivable,
    &ldquo;awfully unnamable&rdquo; - for it is impossible to find
    a name for that which is higher than nature. Be a peasant - be,
    if it could be considered possible nowadays, a village
    clergyman or a schoolmaster - be - and in my opinion this ought
    to be thought of first, the present times being what they are -
    be a painter, and as a human being, after a number of years of
    living in the country and of having a handicraft, as a human
    being you will in the course of these years gradually become
    something better and deeper in the end.</p>

    <p>This is my firm belief. Whether one is <i>more</i> or
    <i>less</i> clever at the start, whether one has the advantage
    of favorable circumstances to a greater or to a lesser extent,
    is, to my way of thinking, far from being the main thing. One
    should start with the conviction that one is in need of
    intercourse with nature, with the conviction that one cannot
    lose one's way by taking this road, and that one's course will
    be straight. And ... there is that other important thing: if
    one should have an easy time of it, like a man living on his
    private means, it would be of very little help; the very fact
    that there is many a hard day and many an &ldquo;effort of lost
    souls&rdquo; will make one a better man.<br>
     And I believe not being absolutely alone does a lot of good,
    as one is apt to become absorbed in one's work; but this should
    not lead to losing one's way, and by taking each other's advice
    the right way can be followed steadily.<br>
     If you talked it over with other people, they would say, What
    are you thinking of? - how wild a venture to give up this, that
    and the other! In short, they would think it madness - a
    blunder. As for myself, I find wildness in a conception of life
    other than the one I am talking about - i.e. being a painter -
    <i>I</i> think it wildly reckless to tie oneself down
    irrevocably to the city and the affairs of the city.<br>
     They will tell you that you are a fanatic, but most certainly
    you - after having undergone so many mental trials - will know
    that it is impossible for you to be fanatical, for you are in a
    period of disenchantment. Don't let them try to turn things
    upside down, that won't do for me!<br>
     <label content="psychology.depression">I feel my own incurable melancholy, caused by certain
    developments in the past, and then they want to tell me that my
    mood is &ldquo;the rash fanaticism of youth&rdquo;! </label>Far, very
    far from it. In your mood one is &ldquo;in damned
    earnest,&rdquo; as the English say. You do not expect to find
    something soft or sweet, no, you know that you are in for a
    fight against something like a rock, no, you know that it is
    impossible to conquer nature and to make her more amenable
    without a terrible struggle and without more than ordinary
    patience.<br>
     And when speaking of your being a painter, they would describe
    your state of mind as that of a dreamer, imagining himself on a
    bed of roses. I ask you, what do those who represent things
    that way know? But people being what they are, this is only one
    of their enormities and not even the worst by a long shot. This
    hopeless absurdity of public opinion makes it only natural for
    one to want to avoid the world.<br>
     One feels things to be wretched and much too distorted, and
    however peaceful and cheerful and full of serenity one's
    natural disposition may be, one feels that this cannot be
    otherwise - but then I ask, what is more practical than telling
    yourself: If I don't do anything about it, I shall lose my
    energy and strength of mind; I am going to refresh, to
    rejuvenate myself in nature; I am going to attack things in a
    new way, and I will arrange my life in such a way that, let's
    say, in a few years I shall have quite new and sure ground
    under my feet.<br>
     I have no patience with &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; common sense
    (a spurious article, unutterably different from the genuine
    one) one is told to use, and which they say one does not use as
    soon as one deviates from the ordinary course and takes a risk.
    I repeat, I have no patience with it. I have no patience with
    it for the very reason that my own natural common sense, if I
    reflect, leads me to wholly different results than the
    conclusion of narrow-minded worldly wisdom and prudent,
    halfhearted righteousness.<br>
     Oh, that dawdling, oh, those hesitations, oh, that not
    believing that good is good, that black is black, that white is
    white.<br>
     Dear brother - <i>I cannot speak</i>; at the <i>present</i>
    moment I am glad I can express myself stumblingly,
    incoherently, roughly. I am glad I cannot write you like
    Tersteeg or Father - for the moment - anyway.<br>
     I am so deeply convinced of your artistic talent that to me
    you will be an artist as soon as you take up a brush or a piece
    of crayon and, adroitly or maladroitly, make something.<br>
     Before you are able to express yourself, that is, your
    plain-thinking virile soul - peaceful, good - before you can
    express this in your work, quite a lot of things must happen;
    but it <i>will</i> come, for as you <i>are</i>, so you
    <i>paint</i> - not in the beginning, assuredly, if one is
    good.<br>
     It is clear to me that there is a je ne sais quoi - I already
    see it in your words, pictures of some little corners in Paris,
    etc., even now I should see it in your first sketches and
    studies. When I think of Father, it seems to me that the good
    in him is due to his intercourse with nature, and in my opinion
    his error is that he attaches more value to other things than
    they are really worth.<br>
     In my eyes Father is a man who, when he ought to have had it,
    did not possess any knowledge of the intimate life of some
    great men. What I mean to say is that in my opinion Father
    never knew, and does not know now, and never will know what the
    soul of modern civilization is. What is it? The eternal quality
    in the <i>greatest of the great</i>: simplicity and truth.
    Dupr&eacute;, Daubigny, Corot, Millet, Isra&euml;ls, Herkomer -
    as well as Michelet, Hugo, Zola, Balzac, and many another
    master of older and newer times. Father is too much
    circumvented by his prejudices to understand this; all through
    life he applies them with a punctiliousness worthy of a better
    cause. For me he is the rayon noir. Why isn't he a rayon blanc?
    - this is the only fault I find in Father. True, it is a great
    fault - I cannot help it. And listen to what I say: Try to find
    the rayon blanc, but blanc, do you hear?<br>
     With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I do not say - far, very far be it from me to say - that I
    myself have the rayon blanc, but I am not ashamed to say that
    it exists, this White Light - and that I seek it, and only this
    do I consider simplicity.</p>
