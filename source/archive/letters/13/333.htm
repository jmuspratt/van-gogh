  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>My thoughts are always with you, no wonder that I write
    rather often.</p>

    <p>Besides, my impressions have become more fixed, my thoughts
    are more collected, things adjust themselves, become more
    tangible. So I can write you about it in all calmness. In the
    first place, I don't see much probability of your remaining on
    good terms with Goupil's. It is such an enormous business that
    it certainly will take a long time before one cannot put up
    with things any longer, before the corruption has penetrated
    <i>everywhere</i>. But, look here - in my opinion there has
    already been a very long period of corruption, so I should not
    be at all astonished if it were far advanced.</p>

    <p>Wisselingh <i>waited</i> - before he went. And it was in
    vain - <i>his</i> heart was entirely in his work - I believe he
    would much rather have stayed on - but it was impossible. I do
    not count Arnold and Trip; they were quite a different sort,
    with less inner life. But I am disposed to include Obach - he
    waited so long and went through so much strain that for a time
    he lost his reason.</p>

    <p>But after all, it is not exactly about the condition of the
    business - about the negative side of things - that I want to
    speak; leaving all that aside, it is about one single positive
    matter that I have something to say.</p>

    <p>A few things have happened to you which I don't think
    unimportant. You have read Zola's books in a different and
    better way than most people do - I consider them among the very
    best of the present time.</p>

    <p>You once said to me, &ldquo;I am like that man in
    Pot-Bouille&rdquo;; I said, &ldquo;No. If you were like
    <i>that</i>, you would do well to enter a new business; but you
    are deeper than he, and I do not know whether you are really a
    man of business; actually I see the artist in you at heart, the
    true artist.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">You have undergone unsought, harrowing mental sufferings;
    now things are running their course. Why? Whither? To the
    renewed beginning of a similar career? My decided opinion is -
    no - there is something deeper than that. Change you must - but
    it must be a general renewal, not a repetition of the same
    thing. You wee not wrong in the past, no, in the past you had
    to be as you were; that past was right. But does it follow that
    it was <i>not</i> simply a preparation, a basis, nothing but a
    schooling, and not a definite thing yet? Why shouldn't that
    follow? In my opinion it is exactly that.</label></p>

    <p>I think things speak so much for themselves that it would be
    impossible for me to tell you anything that is not already
    quite evident, even to yourself. Besides, it strikes me as
    rather curious that there is a change in me of late.</p>

    <p>That just <i>now</i> I find myself in surroundings which so
    entirely engross me, which so order, fix, regulate, renew,
    enlarge my thoughts, that I am quite wrapped up in them. And
    that I can write you, full of what those silent, desolate moors
    tell me. Just at this moment, I feel within me the beginning of
    a change for the better. It isn't there yet, but I see things
    in my work - which I didn't have a little while ago. Painting
    comes more easily to me. I am eager to try all kinds of things
    which I have left undone till now. I know that circumstances
    happen to be so unstable that it is far from certain I shall be
    able to remain here. Perhaps just because of your circumstances
    it might turn out differently. But I should be sorry for it,
    though I would take it quite calmly.</p>

    <p>But I cannot help imagining the future, when I should no
    longer be alone, but you and I, painters, working together as
    comrades here in this moorland.</p>

    <p>That idea presents itself to me in all its attractiveness,
    the thing ought to happen without the slightest fuss, without
    much disturbance like &ldquo;une r&eacute;volution qui est,
    puisqu'il faut qu'elle soit.&rdquo; [A revolution that is,
    because it must be.] That's all - so I only say that I should
    not be in the least astonished if, after some time, we were
    <i>here</i> together. I feel that it <i>may</i> happen, without
    making any more disturbance than a piece of peat rolling from
    one place to another. One moment, and it lies perfectly still
    again, and nobody takes the least notice of it.</p>

    <p>But a human being has his roots, transplanting him is a
    painful thing, though the soil may be better in the place where
    he is transplanted.</p>

    <p>But is that soil better??? What the Puritans were of old,
    such are the painters in the present society.</p>

    <p>It is no foolish, artificial piety or bigotry; it is
    something simple and solid. I am speaking now more particularly
    of the Barbizon people, and that tendency to paint rural life.
    I see in you as a man something that is incompatible with
    Paris. I do not know how may years of Paris have passed over it
    - yes, part of your heart is rooted there - I admit it, but a
    something - a &ldquo;je ne sais quoi&rdquo; - is still
    untouched.</p>

    <p>That's the artistic element. It seems to be weak now - but
    that new shoot will sprout and it will sprout quickly.</p>

    <p>I am afraid the old trunk is split up too much, and I say,
    sprout in an entirely new direction, otherwise I am afraid the
    trunk will prove to lack the necessary vitality. So it seems to
    me - do you think differently?</p>

    <p>The more so because, <i>if</i> you became a painter, you
    would unintentionally have laid the foundation for it yourself,
    and for the first time you would have company, friendship, a
    certain footing. I also think it would cause an immediate
    change in my own work, for what I lack is companionship and
    encouragement in my work, a certain interchange of opinions
    with somebody who knows what a picture is. I have been quite
    without it so long that I think I need that stimulus.</p>

    <p>I have so many plans that I hardly dare to undertake them
    alone - you would make out what they are, what they mean, soon
    enough. Though I wish it were not so, I am extremely sensitive
    about what is said of my work, about what impression I make
    personally. When I meet with distrust, when I am alone, I feel
    a certain void which cripples my initiative. Now you would be
    just the person to understand it - I don't want any flattery,
    or that people should say &ldquo;I like it&rdquo; if they do
    not; no, what I want is an intelligent sincerity, which is not
    vexed by failures. Which, if a thing has failed six times,
    would say just when I begin to lose courage, Now you must try
    again a seventh time. You see, that's the encouragement I need,
    and cannot do without. And I think you would understand it, and
    you would be an enormous help to me.</p>

    <p>And it is something you would be able to do, especially if
    you were obliged to do the same yourself. We should help each
    other, for I, on my part, would be the same to you, and that is
    of some importance. Two persons must believe in each other, and
    feel that it <i>can</i> and <i>must</i> be done - that way they
    are enormously strong. They must keep each other's courage up.
    Well, I think you and I would understand each other.</p>

    <p>I am not sure you could do it if you weren't a painter. The
    only obstacle is the doubt which people generally try to raise:
    Tersteeg, for instance, who is sceptical by nature, who doesn't
    know what it is to believe.</p>

    <p>Millet, however, is the archetype of a <i>believer</i>. He
    often used the expression &ldquo;foi de charbonnier,&rdquo; and
    that expression was already a very old one. One must not be a
    City man, but a Country man, however civilized one may be. I
    cannot express it exactly. There must be a &ldquo;je ne sais
    quoi&rdquo; in a man which keeps his mouth shut and makes him
    active - a certain aloofness even when he speaks - I repeat, an
    inner silence which leads to action. In that way one achieves
    great things - why? Because one has a certain feeling of let
    come what may. One works - what next? I do not know -</p>

    <p>I am not hurrying you, I only want to say, Don't thwart
    nature. What I wish is not foolish, but I have a faint hope
    that one might begin it in a reasonable way, not absolutely
    without, but with only a very little money, just what is
    necessary for board and lodging. And I say now - not with the
    intention of causing an absolute calamity, but in case there is
    the slightest possibility: &ldquo;Follow that little point,
    that very slight possibility, there lies the road - follow it -
    drop everything else. I do not mean drop all external relations
    - you must keep them if you can - but stick to your conviction
    in saying, <i>I will become a painter</i>; so that what Tom,
    Dick and Harry say is like water on a duck's back.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I don't think you would feel like a fish out of water then,
    but that it would be like a coming home to your fatherland,
    that you would feel a great serenity at once - that you would
    feel surer about becoming a painter than about a new situation,
    surer of yourself even than at Goupil's.</p>

    <p>And, boy, there is something else - you are provided with a
    nervous system like other people's - from my own experience I
    must now warn you against something. Take care that your nerves
    do not play a dirty trick on you.<label content="Theo.health"> You have gone through a
    period of terrible mental strain: in fact, you are right in the
    midst of it. You are not the man to break down - if such were
    the case, there would be no danger. If you should have to go
    through the shock of leaving Goupil &amp; co., then calm down
    before you attempt anything new, boy, for if you don't, you
    will probably live to spoil your own constitution and energy,
    and your affairs too.</label></p>

    <p>For a month now I have been breathing the air of the heath;
    I needed it absolutely - I have sat down by a peasant's fire
    with a cradle beside it. Now I speak calmly - I think calmly -
    It is excellent that you have written about it to me - go on
    confiding in me - go on trusting me a little bit more, or
    rather not me, but put your trust in the same thing I put my
    trust in, namely that one ought to risk leaving the world in
    order to look for &ldquo;It&rdquo; in a more quiet life with a
    handicraft. You should do this, not because I tell you to, but
    because you believe in it yourself. Well, in that case I need
    not tell you that you may trust me, seeing that you will
    understand that my endeavour is honest.</p>

    <p>I cannot tell how things would go for me if you did
    <i>not</i> decide to become a painter. If there were a place
    for me in Paris, I should have to take it of course, and
    otherwise I should have to compromise with Father so that I
    could live at home and work in Brabant for a time. But oh, I
    can tell you that I do not think much about it now for the
    moment. I think only of my work, and about that plan for you.
    You are a man with a will, and a good, intelligent, clear head,
    with an honest heart. I think you may safely become a painter
    if you can hold out for a while. And I repeat, it would
    decidedly be a stimulus for my work.</p>

    <p>Today I have been walking behind the ploughers who were
    <art id=1096>ploughing a potato field</art>, with women trudging to pick up a few
    potatoes that were left.</p>

    <p><?showImage("389_V-T_3330");?>
    </p>

    <p>This is quite a different field from the one I scratched for
    you yesterday, but it is curious here - always exactly the
    same, and yet with just enough variation, the same subjects,
    like the pictures of artists who work in the same genre and yet
    are different. Oh, it is so curious here, and <i>so</i> quiet,
    <i>so</i> peaceful. I can find no other word for it but peace.
    Say much about it, say little about it, it is all the same, it
    does not matter at all. It is a question of wanting an entirely
    new thing, of undertaking a kind of renovation of yourself, in
    all simplicity, with the fixed idea: &ccedil;a ira.</p>

    <p>I don't mean to say that you will have no cares - things
    don't run so smoothly - but you must feel, &ldquo;I am doing
    what seems simplest to me - I am finished with all that is not
    simple; I don't want the city any longer, I want the country; I
    don't want an office, I want to paint.&rdquo; That's it. But it
    must be treated as a business matter, though it is deeper, aye,
    infinitely deeper; but every thought must be entirely
    concentrated on it.</p>

    <p>In the future you must consider yourself and me painters.
    There may be worries, there may be obstacles, but <i>always
    consider us so</i> <i>-</i> <i>see your own work before
    you</i>. Look at a bit of nature and think, <i>I</i> will paint
    <i>that</i>. Give yourself up to the fixed idea: to become a
    painter.</p>

    <p>All at once, people, even your best friends, become more or
    less like strangers. You are preoccupied with other things,
    exactly. All at once you feel, damn it, am I dreaming? I am on
    the wrong road - where is my studio, where is my brush?
    Thoughts like these are very deep; of course one says little or
    nothing about it, it would be a mistake to ask for advice about
    it, it wouldn't give you any light.</p>

    <p>It means deciding not to go against it; on the contrary, one
    has the will and the courage to go through with it. I do not
    say one should expect the &ldquo;quelque chose en Haut&rdquo;
    to be precisely this, no, but after all the &ldquo;Something on
    High&rdquo; is there, at least Millet believed in it, and of
    course you have enough confidence in him not to think he was
    woolgathering when he knew it was there. You may well think of
    this - what I say is, life is serious; an honest decision may
    not remove the difficulties attached to its execution, but life
    is serious after all, and therefore one should take it
    seriously, and try to raise one's life to the height of
    something sound; and so in case there is the inevitable
    necessity of a change, then what is right should be of greater
    weight than what people say.</p>

    <p>What was said about it in the past will not be noticed later
    on; it will be of no importance.</p>

    <p>Now art dealers have certain prejudices, which I think you
    may not have shaken off yet, particularly the idea that
    painting is inborn - all right, inborn, but not the way it is
    supposed; one must put out one's hands and <i>grasp</i> it -
    that grasping is a difficult thing - one must not wait till it
    reveals itself. There is something, but not at all what people
    pretend. Practice makes perfect: one becomes a painter by
    painting. If one wants to become a painter, if one delights in
    it, if one feels what you feel, one can do it; but it is
    accompanied by troubles, cares, disappointments, times of
    melancholy, of helplessness and all that, that's what I think
    of it. I think it all such a nuisance that I just had to make a
    little scratch to forget it. Forgive me, I won't say anything
    more about it, it is not worth while.</p>

    <p><?showImage("389_V-T_3331");?>
     But what I wanted to point out again is that in may respects
    this is the right moment, provided bread can be procured,
    nature being so extraordinarily interesting that you would set
    to work <i>eagerly</i> - there would be no bungling, but a
    direct attack on things, as direct and refreshing a struggle as
    can be.</p>

    <p>We should have to show the world so much courage, so much
    energy, so much serenity, not taking things too ponderously,
    you know; in spite of serious cares, we should have to be gay,
    like those Swedes whom you mentioned, like the masters of
    Barbizon. We should have to take things literally,
    energetically, thoroughly - not doubting, dreaming or
    hesitating. That is a plan I should like, I could not care so
    much for any other plan. Therefore I do not doubt for a moment
    that you would be of the same opinion, and that if it should
    come to that, it should be undertaken with all possible
    coolness. And the reason why I write about it is that I want to
    show you that I am of the same opinion. Personally, I believe
    in you as a painter, as an artist, and I respect you as
    such.</p>

    <p>I know than in the beginning, at least, I was as little
    capable of making a thing, but now I no longer doubt that
    practice will improve my work; I may be a good comrade if you
    should get bogged down in the beginning just because I have
    seen this <i>absolute</i> clumsiness in myself.</p>

    <p>I should not be at all surprised at this, and I should be
    able to help you in those things which took me a long time to
    master because then I was alone.</p>

    <p>Of course I don't know exactly how things are, but that does
    not matter in the least; it would be something so new that the
    attendant circumstances would be of relatively little
    importance.</p>

    <p>What I say is this, In all probability you will be obliged
    to make a change, therefore I think it would be excellent if
    you were to make a thorough change of it - taking the bull by
    the horns. The bull called fatality, which would make us all
    miserable and melancholy if he were to get the upper hand; from
    which we shall not be delivered without a struggle. Whatever
    you want - peace - order - a handicraft - art - all right - get
    out of this art-dealing gamble - become a painter. This might
    be foolhardy if Goupil &amp; Co. were now what Goupil &amp; Co.
    was in the past. Now it is too much of a gamble - I am not at
    all curious to know how this will turn out and where it will
    end, no more than you are actually, I think.</p>

    <p>And now another thing - yes, if it <i>must be</i>, if it
    should be utterly impossible to ensure us a period of quiet
    working here&hellip;If you should be <i>forced</i> to attack
    the other thing, have it your own way; then I shall submit and
    resign myself to whatever circumstances result from it for me,
    either by going to Paris or perhaps by going home for a time,
    until things look up a bit. If it must be, I hope I shall be
    able to accept one or the other reasonably.</p>

    <p>I only said a few things about a project in which I feel at
    home; I do not feel at home with the things I say about the
    other possibility.</p>

    <p>It's a great risk, but neither you nor I are afraid to
    venture something. Just think it over, and at all events, write
    soon. Goodbye, boy, with a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>What you ought to do?</p>

    <p>Mais toi tu te tairas,</p>

    <p>Tel que l'on voit se taire un coq sur la bruy&egrave;re.</p>

    <p>[But you will be silent,</p>

    <p>Just as one sees a cock being silent on the heather.]</p>

    <p>You cannot act more coolly than that.</p>
