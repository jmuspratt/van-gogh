  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and the enclosure. Your letter
    explains the reason for your silence to me. You thought that
    &ldquo;<i>feeling well off for the moment</i>,&rdquo; I offered
    you an &ldquo;<i>ultimatum</i>,&rdquo; like, for instance, the
    Nihilists might send the Czar.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, for you and for me, there is no question of
    such a thing here.</p>

    <p>However, I understand your idea <i>now that I know it</i>,
    but it is indeed the last straw. In the first place, I meant
    something quite different - I simply meant, &ldquo;I wouldn't
    want to thrive if you were the loser by it&rdquo; - I would not
    want to develop the artist in me if you had to suppress your
    artistic talent for my sake. I would never approve of your
    repressing the artist in yourself, no matter whose sake it were
    for, for the sake of either father, mother, sister, brother or
    wife. That was my meaning - perhaps nervously expressed, and in
    wrong terms - but I most decidedly meant no more, or nothing
    else.</p>

    <p>You understand it now, don't you?</p>

    <p>With reference to what I wrote in my last letter, it was
    occasioned by your silence, which was an absolute mystery to
    me, was inexplicable until I knew what was the matter.<label content="Theo.mistress"> With
    regard to Marie, I had an answer before I received your letter,
    simply because I remembered what you wrote in the past about
    your meeting her, and I thought, This <i>cannot but be all
    right</i>, there can be nothing wrong with it.</label> So my letter on
    the subject ought to be taken to mean, Brother, without any
    warning you seem to have left me out of things; <i>if</i> you
    did this <i>on purpose</i> I should think it a betrayal, but I
    <i>cannot</i> believe it, so &ldquo;explain it to me&rdquo; -
    that is, approximately; there was no other motive. And as for
    Lady Macbeth, you have rightly interpreted my meaning, it being
    no more than a general hint, and <i>not even a question</i>,
    but only meant to let you feel <i>either</i> it must be like
    this, or it is a <i>misunderstanding</i>.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.apprehension">But know this, brother,
    that I am absolutely cut off from the outer world - except from you - so that it <i>made me
    crazy</i> when your letter did not come at the moment when, far
    from &ldquo;being well off,&rdquo; I was very hard pressed,
    <i>though I did not mention it</i>, because I feel I am rather
    above the cares that gnaw at my heart, which torture I can
    perhaps explain, but do <i>not</i> consider <i>merited</i>.
    Regarding &ldquo;<i>I should not want to thrive if another were
    the loser by it</i>,&rdquo; I hope <i>this</i>, the real
    meaning of what you took for an ultimatum, will always remain
    my conviction, either in prosperity or in &ldquo;agony.&rdquo;
    Your conclusion of my &ldquo;being well off&rdquo; was rather
    fatuous, or rash I think, though the fault must have lain in my
    way of expressing it, but certainly not in my <i>mood</i>.</label></p>

    <p>I will tell you once more that, since I have been here, I
    have had to put my material in good order, I have had to get a
    supply of colours, I have had to make some trips, I have had to
    pay my board and lodging, to send something to the woman, to
    pay off some debts. All these things put together kept me
    <i>very hard up</i>, to use a mild expression. <label content="feelings.loneliness">Add to this that particular torture, loneliness, and really you will no longer
    <i>be able</i> to imagine me &ldquo;well off,&rdquo; either in
    the present or the past.</p>

    <p>I say loneliness, and not solitude, but that loneliness -
    which a painter has to bear, whom everybody in such isolated
    areas regards as a lunatic, a murderer, a tramp, etc. etc.</p>

    <p>Indeed, this may be a small misery, but it is a sorrow after
    all: A feeling of being an outcast - particularly strange and
    unpleasant - though the country may be ever so stimulating and
    beautiful.</label></p>

    <p>But for the rest I only look upon it as a bad time, which
    must be got through, and which one can change but little
    oneself, that is to say, in the relations with people whom one
    would love to have as models, but cannot get.</p>

    <p>Looking back, I see clearly enough now how it came to a
    misunderstanding between you and me.<label content="Theo.work"> There was a moment when
    you were very melancholy and wrote me as follows: &ldquo;My
    employers make the situation almost impossible for me, and I
    even believe they <i>would rather dismiss me than let me
    resign</i>&rdquo; (the latter exactly my case at the time).</label> And
    you said some things about the idea of painting at least not
    being uncongenial to you.</p>

    <p>Well - then I told you frankly all my thoughts about the
    possibility of your becoming a painter; I said, &ldquo;<i>You
    can do it</i> if only you want to, and <i>I</i> believe in you
    <i>as an artist, from the moment you take up the
    brush,</i>&rdquo; though nobody else might.</p>

    <p>What I told you about this I said to you in order to make it
    clear that whatever misfortune - calamity - may overtake you in
    the future, to me the real misfortune is the one which prevents
    you from deciding on &ldquo;a complete renewal&rdquo; now. I am
    of the opinion that, if you, a human being, were overtaken by a
    catastrophe, you would be the greater man for it - with - with
    - with - a scar that always hurts.</p>

    <p>In your case I assume it would <i>lift you up</i> and <i>not
    pull you down</i>, that hurt which only calamity can cause.</p>

    <p>But your later letters are so different in tone and contents
    that now I say, &ldquo;If your rigged ship is all trim, just
    stay on it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>However, I shall stick to what I said through thick and thin
    if a calamity forced you to enter into new relations with
    society. If this should happen, what I have to say is, Let it
    be the signal for a total change of profession, sooner than
    starting the same thing all over again.</p>

    <p>But as long as you have your rigged ship, I do not advise
    you to put out to sea in a fishing boat. Although, speaking for
    myself, I should certainly not want that rigged vessel of
    Goupil &amp; Co.'s back. At the time what I thought was,
    Calamity, burst out for Heaven's sake! And so on.</p>

    <p>At first I did not know how to interpret the change in the
    tone of your letters. On looking back - remembering your
    somewhat melancholy but to me so touching letter, written at a
    moment when G. &amp; Co. <i>was treating you horribly
    unfairly</i> (a moment I passed through <i>in something of the
    same way</i>) - on looking back, I say that I believe you took
    a different view of the moment at which I myself said to
    Messrs. Goupil &amp; Co.: &ldquo;<i>If you are bent on inducing
    me to go, I shall not refuse to go.</i>&rdquo; And that things
    have really <i>calmed down</i>, for good and all perhaps - and
    with your assent - que soit - I do not protest against it. Now
    I do <i>not</i> think it wicked of you - because I think in
    such a case conditions <i>may</i> be offered which really are
    <i>acceptable</i>, and I am convinced that you would <i>not</i>
    have accepted them if there had been anything dishonest in the
    acceptance.</p>

    <p>But my saying something about &ldquo;If you stay, then I
    shall refuse your financial support&rdquo; referred to your
    saying, Let me stay where I am, for I must provide for those at
    home and myself (though you did not mention me) - a delicacy on
    your part not to mention <i>me</i>, which I had to return with
    delicacy on my part. I do not want <i>that</i>, namely such a
    sacrifice of yourself that you should stay there against your
    inclination for other's sakes; that is what you took as an
    ultimatum from me.</p>

    <p>If you stay because you &ldquo;take renewed pleasure in
    it,&rdquo; all right then, and I congratulate you on your newly
    rigged ship, though I for my part do not want to go back to
    it.</p>

    <p>What you wrote me about Serret greatly interests me. Such a
    man, who finally produces something poignant as the blossom of
    a hard, difficult life, is a wonder, like a black hawthorn, or
    better still, the gnarled old apple tree which at a certain
    moment bears blossoms which are among the most delicate and
    most virginal things under the sun.</p>

    <p><i>When a rough man bears blossoms like a flowering
    plant</i>, yes, that is beautiful to see; but before that time
    <i>he</i> has had to stand a great deal of winter cold, more
    than those who later sympathize with him know.</p>

    <p>The <i>artist's life</i>, and <i>what an artist is</i>, it
    is all very curious - how deep it is - how infinitely deep.</p>

    <p>Because of your unaccountable silence, and because I
    connected it with possible new difficulties on the director's
    part, and because of the suspicion of the people at the inn, I
    wrote a note to Father saying that as I had not heard from you,
    I did not know what to think of it, and begging Father to lend
    me some money. I added that I was anxious both about you and
    about myself, especially when thinking of the future, and that
    I wished that you and I, as boys, had become painters then, and
    that I didn't see why we two brothers could not be painters
    yet.</p>

    <p>So if Father should write you about it, you know how it is,
    but I myself (up to now, I have had no answer from Father), I
    shall write Father that your last letter has made it clear to
    me that for the moment G. &amp; Co. has an influence on our
    family, a curious mixture of good and evil, but <i>at all
    events</i>, as it prevents much stagnation, the evil is for the
    moment not prevalent. That my heart knoweth its own bitterness
    is a thing which I think you understand, and in consequence
    will pardon.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ultimatum&rdquo; - it is <i>you</i> who speak of it,
    <i>not</i> I (at least my meaning was something quite
    different) - if <i>you</i> want to take it that way, it is all
    right with <i>me</i>, but <i>I</i> shall <i>not</i> be the
    <i>first</i> to say it - nor was I. For the moment your
    <i>interpretation</i> anticipated my <i>intention</i> by a
    <i>long stretch</i>. I should possibly contradict you as little
    as I did Goupil &amp; Co. in the past if you <i>really
    wanted</i> to carry it into effect. <i>Then</i> I should say
    <i>you, not I</i>, talked first of an ultimatum. If you want to
    interpret it this way, I shall not <i>protest</i> against this
    interpretation.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Brother, all my worst, vague anxieties have been quieted
    since your last letter; I mean that I have perfect confidence
    in you as a man.</p>

    <p>I simply think you will get into certain financial
    difficulties <i>in consequence of the trend of trade</i>.
    Therefore I advise you, if you can economize, then by all means
    economize; if you <i>can</i> save up, then <i>save up</i>. At
    the moment I have nothing myself - but I shall try to rouse
    some interest in certain plans of mine - and in case nobody
    should be willing to return to Drenthe with me later on, I may
    try to find some credit for the purpose of settling there. I am
    not affluent; I have nothing. For a long time I have seen you
    tottering financially - you have taken too much on your
    shoulders - now you think the future will redress it - what I
    think is that you will find the future hostile in Paris. Once
    again, if I am wrong, you can laugh at me, all of you - and I
    myself shall join in this laughter. <i>If</i> it is only my
    nerves that are deluding me, well then, it is my nerves - but I
    am afraid fatality is too effectively against you.</p>

    <p>I shall be able to write you more calmly from home
    [Apparently he intended to go to his parent's house in Nuenen
    for a short time; but he did not go back to Drenthe, and stayed
    in Nuenen for two years].</p>

    <p>There is certainly a field of action for me in Drenthe, but
    from the very beginning I must be able to undertake it somewhat
    differently, and have more financial security. I must calculate
    on a small scale; for now, for instance (I admit, of course,
    it's the first time you skipped a whole term entirely), the
    difference of 25 guilders is for me a thing that may well
    handicap me for another six weeks. I readily believe that you
    can't imagine this - you <i>cannot</i> know how again and again
    a number of difficulties, each very small in itself, makes a
    thing possible or impossible. For instance, last week I got a
    note from my former landlord, who more or less insinuates that
    he might appropriate the things I left behind (among which are
    all my studies, prints, books, which I could hardly do without)
    if I did not send him the 10 guilders I had promised him as
    payment for the use of a garret for my things and a debt of the
    woman's, which he had a doubtful right to claim, but I yielded
    on condition of an arrangement to store my things. Against New
    Year's I have still other things to pay. I still have to pay
    Rappard, and I saved all I could. In short, it is just the
    opposite of being &ldquo;in clover.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><i>It cannot</i> go on the way it is now. I must try and
    find a way out.</p>

    <p>Of course, I do not say it is your fault, but even last year
    I was not able to save more than I did. And the harder I work,
    the harder I am pressed. We have now arrived at a point when I
    say, For the moment I cannot go on.</p>
