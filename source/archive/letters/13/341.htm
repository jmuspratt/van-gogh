  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter, though you yourself admit it to be
    rather short. I know that at present many people call
    everything that is only an interchange of views, everything
    outside their <i>business</i> or <i>facts</i>, quite
    superfluous and even nonsensical in a letter, and so they
    arrive at a certain very concise form, which, however, is at
    the same time a rather unsatisfactory, disappointing way of
    corresponding.</p>

    <p>Well, brother, I wish you had written about it less curtly,
    but it may have been that you were too busy. As to your idea of
    letting some time pass, and then looking at the question again
    from all points of view, I think it wise, and not at all wrong
    in itself. But you add something to that proposal which I will
    answer quite plainly. You say, &ldquo;Think over whether there
    isn't also much to be said for my staying at Goupil's.&rdquo;
    Well, brother, that subject has been in my thoughts from a long
    time ago until now, much more than I told you of in my letters,
    and as you ask me now to consider its advantages, I will, in
    all sincerity, tell you how it seems to me.</p>

    <p>I tell you that more and more I doubt whether the advantage
    of being with Goupil is really to our good, I mean to your
    good, to the good of those at home and to my own good - I'm not
    just thinking of the financial advantage alone, but of other
    doubtful advantages too, such as direct or indirect relations
    with influential persons. In short, taking everything into
    account, I put a question mark after <i>advantage</i>.</p>

    <p>You must understand me well - perhaps - no, certainly -
    there was a crisis at home as well as in my own life when, as I
    sincerely believe, all of our lives were literally <i>saved</i>
    by you. We have been saved from ruin by the protection and
    support we received from you; the situation was critical,
    especially for me. If I have now reached such a point that,
    when I stand before an object or figure, I feel within me
    clearly, distinctly, unhesitatingly, the power to draw it - to
    render it - not perfectly, but true in its general structure
    and proportion - well, that point has been reached, absolutely,
    absolutely, and if I have reached it, it has been primarily
    because your help was a kind of fence or shield between a
    hostile world and myself, and because I could in all calmness
    think almost exclusively of my drawing, and my thoughts were
    not crushed by fatally overwhelming material cares. And though
    I don't know the details of the matter - I believe that those
    at home are under great obligations to you, too. And indirectly
    also to Goupil &amp; Co., so I fully acknowledge the advantage
    <i>up till now</i>; but <i>in the future</i> there comes the
    question mark after <i>advantage</i>. If your help was
    indispensable until now, I believe that in the future I myself
    at least must try to manage my affairs differently.</p>

    <p>The germinating seed must not be exposed to a frosty wind -
    that was the case with me in the beginning. I'm afraid that if
    it hadn't been for you, Uncle Vincent's words, &ldquo;ni fait,
    ni &agrave; faire,&rdquo; Tersteeg's words, and the
    accompanying cold shoulder from both at a critical moment would
    have been fatal to me, like a too cold wind to the germinating
    corn. But once the winter corn is rooted in the earth, it
    becomes a little stronger, and it struggles through the winter
    as best it can, at least it <i>must</i> get through. And now,
    brother, I would think it mean in myself if I said, The money
    from you <i>must</i> continue, in that way inducing you to stay
    with Goupil &amp; Co. If you arrive at that decision I am so
    decidedly against it, I warn you, so decidedly - the
    art-dealing business will betray you in the end - that I will
    take no part in forcing you to such a decision by needing help
    myself.</p>

    <p>And though I hope we shall remain as true friends as ever,
    and shall always feel our brotherhood tie, I repeat, it is my
    intention to refuse your financial help as soon as you bind
    yourself to Goupil &amp; Co. <i>for good</i>, because I am sure
    you would regret such a decision in the end, and it would put
    you in a position of which you might say, I wish I had never
    accepted it; and at the same time you would think, Then why did
    my brother and my parents drive me into it? I will not be
    guilty of bringing you to that decision, so now you know what I
    really think in all frankness about the &ldquo;advantages(?) of
    Goupil's.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">How should I manage then? Well, for instance, I could try to
    get a job as an illustrator for a magazine, or, in short, do
    anything &ldquo;n'importe quoi,&rdquo; for which perhaps you
    yourself would know an opportunity, or in which you could
    advise me - for instance, about the Moniteur Universel, though
    I do not consider this the most desirable connection.</p>

    <p>But if I were left entirely to myself, I might take a chance
    in Paris, or London, or The Hague - in short, in some city in a
    printer's or a magazine's office - of course trying at the same
    time to make and sell drawings and paintings; and after that,
    manage to get back to Drenthe.</label></p>

    <p>Then I should want, however, to submit myself to the utmost
    stress in order to <i>force</i> myself to be productive, and I
    would beg to stop the present assistance of my own accord.</p>

    <p>But, brother, this is in case of your staying with Goupil
    &amp; Co., and in the other possibility, your deciding to
    become a painter, we should of course feel the pressure of an
    enormous compulsion behind us, and would have to encourage each
    other in those circumstances by faithful comradeship; but
    though I shall always be, and remain, grateful beyond all words
    and expressions for your help, my intention for the future is
    fixed: if you stay with Goupil, this will push me straightway
    to the decision mentioned above, though our friendship will of
    course remain, unless you should object to having anything to
    do with me.</p>

    <p>If it might be - and I don't think it absolutely impossible
    - that not the circumstances but <i>your own soul</i> lead you
    to painting, well, then it is quite natural for us to join
    hands for one and the same aim and ideal.</p>

    <p>But as to trying to put up with the thought of approving (?)
    of your staying with Goupil, of considering the
    <i>advantages</i> (?) of it --you see how I look upon these
    things. I have had my own experiences with Goupil in the past;
    a look thereon, a look at the present time, and a look into the
    future lead me to a Beware! And, for myself, I think Paris
    enervating, and I see no good in living there permanently,
    neither for myself nor for you.</p>

    <p>As for me, perhaps I shall have to be there for a time in
    order to make some contacts (made impossible for me at The
    Hague), but I will stay in the country as much as I can, and
    the only thing which counts with me is painting or drawing.
    Goodbye, boy, for the rest, let some time pass, and receive in
    thought a warm handshake from,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>You know, brother, I had promised Wisselingh to show him
    some studies from Drenthe before the winter. Now I am sending
    you today six studies; be so kind as to show them to him
    someday, as a small sign of life, though of course I do not
    suppose they will be considered saleable.</p>

    <p>The painting out-of-doors is over, it is already too cold of
    late. But what a relief it would be if I could settle in these
    parts for good.</p>

    <p>The house rent is very low; if only one had company, how
    delightful it would be to rent a peasant's cottage and fix up
    everything more solidly and less precariously than at an
    inn.</p>

    <p>Well, I repeat, let us possess our souls in patience, let
    things decide themselves.</p>

    <p>Taking a house alone is so very melancholy and chilly. There
    must be some life in the camp to keep things going and to
    prevent stagnation.</p>

    <p>But, Theo, how inexpressibly beautiful it is here!</p>

    <p>You cannot see it at all from my studies yet; I still have
    much to learn before I can express how it really is here, and
    it is also a question of time.</p>

    <p>One thing I declare, that this country had an influence of
    calm, of faith, of courage on me, and I believe you need that
    influence too - it would be the very, very best thing for you;
    it would make you discover yourself again, your soul, but in a
    more genuine and complete way than at the time of drawing
    mills. But I am afraid you consider what I say as the product
    of my imagination, my words as idle and without foundation.</p>

    <p>And I admit it is very difficult to know what one has to do.
    Money plays a brutal part in society, and I partially share
    your feelings in that respect. But then, I feel such a vivid
    hope that painting will set our real energy free, and yet keep
    us afloat, though the first years may be very difficult. If I
    have to perish, then I shall perish, is the only thing one can
    say. As to my saying, If you stay with Goupil for good, I shall
    be obliged to refuse your help, do not suppose I think too
    highly of my present work.</p>

    <p>No, I am well aware it had no market value, but my idea is
    that I want to work without any more protection than others
    have, and I shall throw myself into it headlong, not because I
    think I have arrived, but because I believe: &ldquo;je
    grandirai dans la temp&ecirc;te&rdquo; [I shall grow in the
    tempest].</p>

    <p>You may ask, what is my intention in saying &ldquo;stay with
    Goupil for good&rdquo;? Look here - now winter is at the door
    and I am sitting here lost on the heath, what else can I do for
    the purpose but work?</p>

    <p>But suppose toward spring, for instance the month of March,
    you are still on good terms with Goupil, without any prospect
    of leaving. That is what I should call &ldquo;staying for
    good,&rdquo; and then I should try to take another direction,
    or rather, I should force myself to it, by an enormous
    compulsion.</p>

    <p>Fortune favours the bold, says the proverb, and though
    something may perhaps be said against it, I decidedly believe
    its basis to be a fact, in the same way as the opposite: that
    moral weakness or want of courage brings a kind of fatal doom
    in the end.</p>

    <p>So my plan is always to risk too much rather than too
    little; if one is defeated by too much, well, so be it. In
    short, I don't want my needs to be a reason for your staying;
    if you want to stay, do so, but not for my sake, as I think it
    decidedly not the right road for you.</p>

    <p>Once more a warm handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Please don't take what I tell you amiss, as if I should have
    a personal grudge against you if you stayed on, for even then I
    approve of you as you are.</p>

    <p>It is absolutely nothing but the fact that I don't want it
    said that I should ever consent to your being in a profession
    against your will, with my knowledge, more or less for my
    sake.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Je ne veux point que la poche d'autrui p&acirc;tisse
    de mes hardiesses.&rdquo; [I certainly don't want anybody's
    purse to suffer from my liberties.]</p>
