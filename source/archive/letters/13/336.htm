  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>It is Sunday today and you are not out of my thoughts for a
    moment. I should think it is quite appropriate to apply to
    business the words &ldquo;plus tu y resteras plus &ccedil;a
    t'emb&ecirc;tera&rdquo; [the more you stay in it the more it
    will bore you], and to painting, &ldquo;plus &ccedil;a
    t'amusera,&rdquo; using &ldquo;amusera&rdquo; in the more
    serious sense of energy, cheerfulness, vitality.</p>

    <p>Oh, I said I should give Tom, Dick and Harry their due - by
    all means - let's do; but having done justice to those things,
    aren't they absurd, those formalities and conventions - in
    fact, aren't they really <i>bad</i>?</p>

    <p>In order to maintain a certain rank, one is obliged to
    commit certain villainies, falsehoods - willingly and
    knowingly, premeditatedly. That's what I call the fatal side,
    even of the rayon noir, let alone when there is no rayon at
    all.</p>

    <p>Now take, for instance, the painters of Barbizon: not only
    do I understand them as men, but in my opinion
    <i>everything</i> <i>-</i> the smallest, the most intimate
    details - sparkles with humour and life. The &ldquo;painter's
    family life,&rdquo; with its great and small miseries, with its
    calamities, its sorrows and griefs, has the advantage of having
    a certain good will, a certain sincerity, a certain real human
    feeling. Just because of that <i>not</i> maintaining a certain
    standing, not even thinking about it.</p>

    <p>If you take &ldquo;amusera&rdquo; in the highly serious
    sense of &ldquo;thinking it interesting,&rdquo; then I say, it
    will amuse you.</p>

    <p>And as to the safe position, there is
    &ldquo;emb&ecirc;tera,&rdquo; &ldquo;abrutira&rdquo; [(will)
    stupefy].</p>

    <p>Do I say this because I despise culture? On the contrary, I
    say it because I look upon the real human feelings, life in
    harmony with, not against, nature, as the true civilization,
    which I respect as such. I ask, what will make me more
    completely human?</p>

    <p>Zola says, &ldquo;Moi artiste, je veux vivre tout haut -
    <i>veux vivre&rdquo;</i> [I, as an artist, want to live as
    vigorously as possible - (I) <i>want to live</i>], without
    mental reservation - naive as a child, no, not as a child, as
    an artist - with good will, however life presents itself, I
    shall find something in it, I will try my best on it. Now look
    at all those studied little mannerisms, all that convention,
    how exceedingly conceited it really is, how absurd, a man
    thinking he knows everything and that things go according to
    his idea, as if there were not in all things of life a
    &ldquo;je ne sais quoi&rdquo; of great goodness, and also an
    element of evil, which we feel to be infinitely above us,
    infinitely greater, infinitely mightier than we are.</p>

    <p>How fundamentally wrong is the man who doesn't feel himself
    small, who doesn't realize he is but an atom.</p>

    <p>Is it a loss to drop some notions, impressed on us in
    childhood, that maintaining a certain rank or certain
    conventions is the most important thing? I myself do not even
    think about whether I lose by it or not. I know only by
    experience that those conventions and ideas do not hold true,
    and often are hopelessly, fatally wrong. I come to the
    conclusion that I do not know anything, but at the same time
    that this life is such a mystery that the system of
    &ldquo;conventionality&rdquo; is certainly too narrow. So that
    it has lost its credit with me.</p>

    <p>What shall I do now? The common phrase is, &ldquo;What is
    your aim, what are your aspirations?&rdquo; Oh, I shall do as I
    think best - how? I can't say that beforehand - you who ask me
    that pretentious question, do you know what <i>your</i> aim is,
    what <i>your</i> intentions are?</p>

    <p>Now they tell me, &ldquo;You are unprincipled when you have
    no aim, no aspirations.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>My answer is, I didn't tell you I had <i>no</i> aim, no
    aspirations, I said it is the height of conceit to try to force
    one to define what is indefinable. These are my thoughts about
    certain vital questions. All that arguing about it is one of
    the things of which I say &ldquo;emb&ecirc;tera.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Live - do something - that is more amusing, that is more
    positive. In short - one must of course give Society its due,
    but at the same time feel absolutely free, believing not in
    one's own judgment, but in &ldquo;reason&rdquo; (my judgment is
    human, reason is divine, but there is a link between the one
    and the other), and that my own conscience is the compass which
    shows me the way, although I know that it does not work quite
    accurately.</p>

    <p>I should like to refer to the fact that, whenever I recall
    the past generation of painters, I remember an expression of
    yours, &ldquo;they were <i>surprisingly</i> gay.&rdquo; What I
    want to say is that, if you become a painter, you should do it
    with this same <i>surprising</i> gaiety. You will need this to
    offset the gloomy circumstances. It will be a greater help to
    you than anything else. What you want is a spark of genius; I
    know no other word for it, but what I mean is the exact
    opposite of &ldquo;being ponderous,&rdquo; as people call it.
    Please don't tell me that neither you nor I could have this. I
    say this because I am of the opinion that we must do our best
    to become like that; I do not claim that either I myself or you
    have sufficiently captured it - but what I say is, Let's do our
    best to get it. And I say this to show you - writing these
    things down, although I think you will be able to understand
    what is in my mind anyway - that you are not mistaken in my
    ideas. I believe the whole plan would be enhanced immeasurably
    if your remaining with the woman you are with now were combined
    with it.</p>

    <p>And if it is in your nature as well as hers to feel even a
    certain pleasure - a surprising gaiety - in the face of
    circumstances - a je ne sais quoi of surprising
    <i>youthfulness</i> - and I do not count this among the
    impossibilities, for you said she is intelligent - well then,
    you will be able to do more together than alone. And in this
    case, if persons of the same sentiment, persons who have the
    same pretty serious misery, combine to see things through, what
    I say is, the more the merrier.</p>

    <p>And what I say is - if this had come about or should come
    about, this combining to carve your own way in the world means
    infinitely more than any standing on form, and rises above all
    gossip, all qu'en dira-t-on.</p>

    <p>I know all these things have a perilous money side, but what
    I say is, let's weaken this perilous money side as much as
    possible, in the first place by not being under its sway too
    long, and then by feeling that if one will only set about
    things with love, with a certain understanding of each other
    and cooperation and mutual helpfulness, many things which would
    otherwise be insupportable would be softened - yes, even
    totally changed.</p>

    <p>As for me, if I could find some people whom I could talk to
    about art, who felt for it and wanted to feel for it - I should
    gain an enormous advantage in my work - I should feel more
    myself, <i>be</i> more myself. If there is enough money to keep
    us going in the very first period, by the time it is gone I
    shall be earning money. The more I think it over, the more it
    appears to me in the way I felt it in the beginning.</p>

    <p>Your heart is partly with the firm of Goupil &amp; Co., but
    in their presumption G. &amp; Co. demand unreasonable things.
    In the first place, they are doing you a great wrong, which
    causes you much grief. This is not only a question of money,
    your heart is in it, for you it means heartache. You would
    start on a new career with the same heartache, and possibly
    with a similar result. Look, is this possible?</p>

    <p>What I say is, I doubt it.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that you, who are very young, do not act
    recklessly when you argue, I have had enough of the art-dealing
    business but not of art; I'll drop the business, and aim at the
    very heart of the profession.</p>

    <p>That is what I ought to have done at the time. My making a
    mistake was perhaps a natural error of judgment, because then I
    did not know anything about teaching or about the Church - did
    not know anything about it, and cherished ideals about it.</p>

    <p>You will say, Doesn't one sometimes have ideals about art
    that are incompatible with existing conditions?</p>

    <p>Well, answer that question for yourself. I also answer it
    for myself by asking, Is Barbizon, is the Dutch school of
    painters a fact or not?</p>

    <p>Whatever may be said of the art world, it is not rotten. On
    the contrary, it has improved and improved, and perhaps the
    summit has already been reached; but at all events we are still
    quite near it, and as long as you and I live, though we might
    reach the age of a hundred, there will be a certain real
    vitality. So he who wants to paint - must put his shoulder to
    the wheel.<label content="Theo.mistress"> If the woman came, of course she would have to paint
    too.</label></p>

    <p>Everybody would have to paint here - the wife of one of the
    Van Eycks also had to do it. And I tell you that the people
    don't seem disagreeable or intriguing. There is a kind of
    benevolence in this place, and I think you can do exactly what
    you think best. There is a surprisingly youthful atmosphere in
    existence here.</p>

    <p>One should begin by saying with all possible courage,
    gaiety, enthusiasm, I know none of us can do a thing, but for
    all that, we are painters. Our <i>wanting</i> in itself means
    <i>action</i>. This is what I believe should be the main
    idea. We are alive - if we do not work &ldquo;comme plusieurs
    n&egrave;gres,&rdquo; we shall die of want, and we shall cut a
    most ridiculous figure. However, we happen to abhor this
    mightily - because of that same thing which I call surprising
    youthfulness - and in addition, a seriousness that is damned
    serious.</p>

    <p>That...y mettre sa peau.</p>

    <p>Well, if this were mere speculation, I should not want to
    think of it - but in this case it means a fight to free
    ourselves from the world of conventions and speculation. It is
    something good, something peaceful, an honest enterprise. Most
    certainly it will be our intention to try to earn our bread,
    but only in the literal sense of the word. Money, as far as it
    is not used for the absolute necessaries of life, leaves us
    cold. We shall do nothing we need be ashamed of; with what
    Carlyle calls &ldquo;quite a royal feeling,&rdquo; we shall be
    able to roam about in nature freely, and to work - we shall be
    able to work, because we are honest. We shall say, when we were
    children we made a mistake, or rather, We had to obey, and do
    certain things to earn our bread. Later such and such things
    happened, and then we thought it advisable to turn
    handicraftsmen. Because certain things were too puffed up. If
    you should talk this over with other people, they would advise
    against it unanimously, I think, except perhaps the woman you
    are with.</p>

    <p>If you have come to a decision for yourself, avoid other
    people, because they can only weaken your energy. Just at the
    very moment when one has not yet lost one's outer clumsiness,
    when one is still green, a &ldquo;ni fait ni a faire&rdquo;
    [neither done nor to be done] is enough to cause discouragement
    for half a year, after which one at last sees that one ought
    not to have let oneself be led astray.</p>

    <p>I know the soul's struggle of two people: Am I a painter or
    not? Of Rappard and of myself - a struggle, hard sometimes, a
    struggle which accurately marks the difference between us and
    certain other people who take things less seriously; as for us,
    we feel wretched at times; but each bit of melancholy brings a
    little light, a little progress; certain other people have less
    trouble, work more easily perhaps, but then their personal
    character develops less. You, too, would have that struggle,
    and I tell you, don't forget that you are in danger of being
    upset by people who undoubtedly have the very best
    intentions.</p>

    <p><?showImage("392_V-T_3360");?>
     If you hear a voice within you saying, &ldquo;You are not a
    painter,&rdquo; <i>then by all means paint</i>, boy, and that
    voice will be silenced, but only by working. He who goes to
    trends and tells his troubles when he feels like that loses
    part of his manliness, part of the best that's in him; your
    friends can only be those who themselves struggle against it,
    who raise your activity by their own example of action. One
    must undertake it with confidence, with a certain assurance
    that one is doing a reasonable thing, like the farmer drives
    his plough, or like our friend in the scratch below, who is
    harrowing, and even drags the harrow himself. If one hasn't a
    horse, one is one's own horse - many people do so here.</p>

    <p>There is a saying of Gustave Dore's which I have always
    admired, &ldquo;J'ai la patience d'un b&oelig;uf,&rdquo; I find
    a certain goodness in it, a certain resolute honesty - in
    short, that saying has a deep meaning, it is the word of a real
    artist. When one thinks of the man from whose heart such a
    saying sprang, all those oft-repeated art dealer's arguments
    about &ldquo;natural gifts&rdquo; seem to become an abominably
    discordant raven's croaking. &ldquo;J'ai la patience&rdquo; -
    how quiet it sounds, how dignified; they wouldn't even say it
    except for that very raven's croaking. I am not an artist - how
    coarse it sounds - even to think so of oneself - oughtn't one
    to have patience, oughtn't one to learn patience from nature,
    learn patience from seeing the corn slowly ripen, seeing things
    grow - should one think oneself so absolutely dead as to
    imagine that one would not grow any more? Should one thwart
    one's own development on purpose? I say this to explain why I
    think it so foolish to speak about natural gifts and no natural
    gifts.</p>

    <p>But in order to grow, one must be rooted in the earth. So I
    tell you, take root in the soil of Drenthe - you will germinate
    there - don't wither on the sidewalk. You will say there are
    plants that grow in the city - that may be, but you are corn,
    and your place is in the cornfield.</p>

    <p>Well, I too suppose that for financial reasons now may not
    be the right moment, but at the same time I suppose that
    circumstances may just make it possible. If there were only
    half a possibility, I believe you would do well to risk the
    venture. I do not think you would ever regret it. You would be
    able to develop the best that is in you, and have a more
    peaceful life altogether. Neither of us would be alone, our
    work would merge. In the beginning we should have to live
    through anxious moments, we should have to prepare ourselves
    for them, and take measures to overcome them; we should not be
    able to go back, we should not look back nor be able to look
    back; on the contrary, we should force ourselves to look ahead.
    But it's in this period that we shall be far removed from all
    our friends and acquaintances, we shall fight this fight
    without anybody seeing us, and this will be the best thing that
    can happen, for then nobody will hinder us. We shall look
    forward to victory - we feel it in our very bones. We shall be
    so busy working that we shall be absolutely unable to think of
    anything else but our work.</p>

    <p>I don't suppose I'm telling you anything at all new, I only
    ask, Don't thwart your own best thoughts. Think that idea over
    with a certain good-humored optimism instead of looking at
    things gloomily and pessimistically. I see that even Millet,
    just because he was so serious, couldn't help keeping good
    courage. This is something peculiar, not to all styles of
    painting, but to Millet, Isra&euml;ls, Breton, Boughton,
    Herkomer and others.</p>

    <p>Those who seek real simplicity are themselves so simple, and
    their view of life is so full of willingness and courage, even
    in hard times.</p>

    <p>Think these things over, write me about them. It must be
    &ldquo;une revolution qui est, puisqu'il faut qu'elle
    soit.&rdquo; [A revolution that is, because it must be.] With a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
