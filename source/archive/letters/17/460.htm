  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>This morning we got your letter. We think that it is already
    something that you have broached the subject - and broken the
    ice as you have spoken about it with the Hollandsche heeren [Dutch gentlemen],
    etc. And I do not think that my &ldquo;elle sera &agrave; la
    vapeur&rdquo; was wrong; I myself see that
    &agrave; la vapeur in the future. And as
    to the immediate present, you will remember that I said to you:
    meet with a refusal this time if necessary, but then in any
    case the subject is broached - and then there will have to
    follow a second trip to Holland by Bonger and you together. For
    the time being there is every reason to say with Father
    Pangloss: tout est pour le miex dans le meilleur des
    mondes. [Everything is for the best in the best of
    worlds.]</p>

    <p>But, old fellow, the solution to the S. problem which you
    mention in today's letter, namely &ldquo;either she gets out or
    I get out,&rdquo; would be very succinct and efficacious - if it
    were practical. But you will run your head against the same
    difficulties Bonger and I had to face the last few days, and
    which we are taking the utmost trouble to clear away. These
    difficulties are of a nature other than you suppose, but this
    is not the moment to discuss details; we shall tell you all
    about it as soon as you get back.</p>

    <p>That you are not suited to S. and S. is not suited to you is,
    I think, incontrovertible, as well as that you must part company -
    but how? It would be a good thing if you accepted the idea that the
    affair cannot be settled in the way you propose, by treating her
    harshly you would immediately drive her to suicide or insanity, and
    the repercussions on you would be sad indeed and leave you a
    broken man.</p>

    <p>So no catastrophes, please! Well, I told Bonger what I told
    you, namely that you should try and pass her on to somebody
    else, and I told him more explicitly what my feelings on the
    subject are that an amicable arrangement, which would seem
    obvious, could be reached by your passing her on to me. So it
    is certain that, if you could reconcile yourself to it, and S.
    too, I am ready to take S. off your bands, preferably
    <i>without</i> having to marry her, but if the worst comes to
    the worst <i>even</i> agreeing to a marriage de raison.</p>

    <p>I am writing this in a few short words in order that you may
    have time to think things over before your return. As in this
    way she could keep house for you, and as she would live on what
    she earns by working, it would be rather a saving of expense
    than the reverse. Lucie has been given notice; I told her that
    you could not continue paying her, as it was too expensive, but
    I have kept her on until your return, so that you may be able
    to decide what you will do about the housekeeping, and in case
    the decision cannot be arrived at on the first day, it may be
    desirable to let the housekeeping go on on the same footing, as
    far as Lucie is concerned, until you have decided about what to
    do with S.</p>

    <p>If you could agree with this arrangement, the first
    consequence, as I see it, would be that you would feel a free
    man, and your own engagement would become &agrave; la
    vapeur. Keep courage and be calm!</p>

    <p>As for my work, I painted the pendant of those flowers which
    you have. A branch of white lilies - white, pink, green -
    against black, something like black Japanese lacquer inlaid
    with mother-of-pearl, which you know - then a bunch of orange
    tiger lilies against a blue background, then a bunch of
    dahlias, violet against a yellow background, and red gladioli
    in a blue vase against light yellow.</p>

    <p>I have read Bel Ami by Guy de Maupassant.</p>

    <p>Do you know that Bonger is sleeping here as well as S., and
    these are queer days; at times we are afraid of her, and at
    other times we are almighty gay and lighthearted. But S. is
    seriously deranged, and she is not cured yet by a long
    shot.</p>

    <p>However, the moment you meet again, you will both feel that
    the liaison between S. and you is definitely <i>off</i> and so
    you need not be afraid of getting tied to her again. But you
    must talk a lot with her, and try to get her settled down.
    Please think it over in the interval between now and your
    return, and remember: aux grand maux les grands
    rem&egrave;des.</p>

    <p>Bonger is sure to add something to this letter, if he does
    not write to you directly from his office.</p>

    <p>I quite agree to the exchange for two watercolours by
    Isabey, especially if they are figures. Try to make an exchange
    for the pendant that I have here, and to get something else
    with it. I say, would it not be possible to get the Otto Weber
    from Prinsenhage, that beautiful autumn? I would give them a
    series of four in exchange. We need pictures more than
    drawings, but do what seems best. Love to all at home.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Andreis Bonger]</p>

    <p>The basis of V.'s reasoning corresponds with my own
    conviction. The problem is that S.'s eyes must be opened. She
    is not the least bit in love with you, but it is as if you have
    cast a spell on her. Morally she is seriously ill. It goes
    without saying that we could not leave her to her fate in this
    condition. On the contrary, we have been as kind as possible to
    her. If we hadn't, she would have gone mad. What makes me
    optimistic about her recovery is something she said last night:
    &ldquo;que je suis b&ecirc;te de ne pouvoir me faire un
    raisonnement.&rdquo; [how stupid I am not to be
    reasonable.] So it seems she feels what is the matter with her.
    The great difficulty is her obstinacy, which we have repeatedly
    bumped our heads against, as against a stone wall. Nothing is
    to be gained by harsh treatment. For the time being it is
    extremely difficult to make a plan, (Vincent's is impractical,
    as far as I can see), but I hope you are fully convinced that
    your handling of her has been wrong; during the past year your
    relations have had no other result than getting her hopelessly
    muddled. Perhaps it would have been better to live together
    completely; then she would have seen of her own accord that you
    are not at all well matched. If she could live a month with
    somebody else who would be able to satisfy her sensuality and
    take care of her (for she requires a lot of care) so that she
    may recover her health, you would be forgotten. Her condition
    greatly resembles the nervous overexcitement of most girls in
    Holland. It will prove no less difficult to convince S. of hers
    than it would be to give rest to those minds at home.</p>

    <p>I don't suppose you have met my sisters Jo and Annie; as far
    as I know, both of them are out of town. We are both anxious to
    know how things are in Amsterdam. It gave me great pleasure to
    hear that V. is appreciated now. What a satisfaction for you,
    because of the firm confidence you have always had in him! He
    has made a number of very beautiful things; those on a yellow
    background are quite striking. The flower pieces are most gay
    and colourful as a whole; but some pictures are flat, a thing I
    am unable to convince him of. He persists in replying, But I
    wanted to introduce this or that colour contrast. As if I give
    a damn about what he <i>wanted</i> to do!</p>

    <p>Write soon when you will come back. Try to come back with a
    renewed physical strength, and a clear mind, and an inflexible
    will. You will need all three of them.</p>

    <p>For the matter, the situation is not at all hopeless, though
    it is precarious. Spijker is recovering only very slowly.
    Remember me to your family, and believe that I am with all my
    heart</p>

    <p>Your friend, Bonger</p>
