    <p>[Extracts from letters written by A. Bonger in Paris to his
    parents in Amsterdam.]</p>

    <p>March 17<sup>th</sup> 1886</p>

    <p>Some days ago De Meester <sup>1</sup> paid Van Gogh a visit.
    We were not mistaken; he was the man who nearly went into
    hysterics when he had to pass the Ambassador&hellip;V. G. let
    him speak freely; I think there is no better way to form an
    opinion of a man whom one has never met than by letting him
    talk&hellip;</p>

    <p>Did I write you that Van Gogh's brother, who is studying to
    be a painter, has arrived here? The consequences will be that
    we shall not see much of V. G. in the future, for they are
    having their meals together in their neighbourhood. His mother
    and sisters are leaving Nuenen for Breda shortly.</p>

    <p>June 23<sup>rd</sup> 1886</p>

    <p>Did I tell you that Van Gogh has moved to Montmartre? They
    now have a big, spacious apartment (by Parisian standards) and
    their own household. They are now keeping their own cook in
    optima forma. <label content="Theo.health">Theo is still looking frightfully ill; he
    literally has no face left at all. That poor fellow has many
    cares.</label> Moreover, his brother is making life rather a burden to
    him, and reproaches him with all kinds of things of which he is
    quite innocent. For a long time he has had no news of his
    sister Lize.</p>

    <p>1886</p>

    <p>It now appears that Theo's brother has come to stay; for the
    next three years at least he is going to work in the painter
    Cormon's studio. I think I told you last summer what a queer
    life this brother has led. The man hasn't the slightest notion
    of social conditions. He is always quarreling with everybody.
    Consequently Theo has a lot of trouble getting along with
    him.</p>

    <p>August 27<sup>th</sup> 1886</p>

    <p>My patients (during Theo's absence Vincent van Gogh was
    taken ill too) prevented me from writing you. Otherwise I
    should have sought an earlier opportunity to thank you for the
    cordiality with which you received Theo. He is quite elated
    with his stay with you. Thursday morning he came back. It gives
    me a lot of pleasure too that you like him. The better one gets
    to know him, the more one learns to appreciate the refinement
    of his mind. His company is always entertaining. During his
    absence I slept in his apartment, for Vincent was
    alone&hellip;</p>

    <p>It is settled that in the future I am going to have my
    dinners at Van Gogh's. It is true that it takes a lot of time,
    for he is living in Montmartre, and consequently the evenings
    will be quite lost, but it is more pleasant for both of us. We
    always have subjects enough o discuss, the three of us.</p>

    <p>February 18<sup>th</sup> 1887</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">Van Gogh too stands in great need of being renovated. He
    continues to look sick and emaciated, and he is feeling weak.
    If he were not such a desperately pig-headed fellow, he would
    have gone and consulted Gruby long ago.</label></p>
