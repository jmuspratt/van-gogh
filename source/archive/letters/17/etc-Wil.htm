    <p>Extract from a letter from Wilhelmina van Gogh to Line
    Kruysse, a Dutch girlfriend.</p>

    <p>Nuenen, 26 August 1886</p>

    <p>&hellip;</p>

    <p>My second brother, Theo, from Paris, left yesterday; he
    really is a dear boy. He told us so many good things about
    Vincent, the eldest, who is living with him. His paintings are
    getting so much better and he is beginning to exchange them for
    those of other painters, so everything's sure to come right in
    time. According to Theo, he is definitely making a name for
    himself. But we are under no illusions, and are only too
    grateful that he is having some slight success. You don't know
    what a hard life he has had, and who can say what is still in
    store for him. His disappointments have often made him fell
    bitter and have turned him into an unusual person. That was
    difficult for my parents, who could not always follow him and
    often misunderstood him. My father was strict, and attached to
    all sorts of conventions of which my brother never took any
    particular notice; needless to say, that often led to clashes
    and to words spoken in anger, which neither party was quick to
    forget. So during the past eight years Vincent has been a bone
    of contention with many, and all too often one tended to forget
    all the good there was in him, the appearances to the contrary.
    During the past few years he has been working at home with us;
    after my father's death, Anna thought it would be more peaceful
    for Mother if he stopped living at home, and saw to it that he
    left us. He took that so badly that from then on he has not
    been in touch with us, and it is only through Theo that we have
    news of him.</p>
