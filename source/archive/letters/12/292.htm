  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Your letter and the enclosure were very welcome, many
    thanks. And I was glad to see that you take things calmly,
    though I did not expect anything else.</p>

    <p>Since I wrote you last I have been drudging very hard on
    that drawing of the refuse dump: it is a splendid scene.</p>

    <p>The first drawing of it has already undergone so many
    corrections; first it was white, then black in all kinds of
    patches, so that I copied it on a second sheet, because the
    first one was too overworked. And I am working on it anew. I
    must get up early in the morning for it, for then I get the
    effects I need. If I could only get it the way I have it in my
    mind!</p>

    <p>Well, the second one is of the same size as the two former
    ones of the peat cutting and the sand digging, and it fits in
    the frame. For the moment it is looking rather good, but I am
    afraid I'll spoil it. But one must not be afraid of that
    either, otherwise one never succeeds. And meanwhile I made a
    large study of a seamstress besides.</p>

    <p>But the asylum has been a disappointment in that they
    refused me permission to draw there - they said there was no
    precedent for it, and besides, they were in the midst of
    spring-cleaning, and new floors were being laid in the wards.
    Well, never mind, there are more homes for the poor, but in
    this one I know a man who posed for me regularly, and that
    would have made it easy for me to make sketches. Last winter I
    saw the old almshouse in Voorburg. It is of course much
    smaller, but almost even more striking.</p>

    <p>It was toward evening when I was there, the old people were
    sitting on benches and chairs round an old stove, very
    characteristic.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I'll try that one at Voorburg, since I have no
    permission here. I also spent a day at Scheveningen, and saw a
    beautiful scene there of men with a cart full of nets which had
    been tarred and were being spread out on the dunes.</p>

    <p>Someday I must certainly make a large drawing of that or of
    <i>mending</i> the nets. It is an improvement, Theo, having
    those stretchers and that frame for charcoal drawings, or
    whatever, for it is pleasant working with them. I think you are
    quite right in what you say about too much intercourse with
    painters <i>not</i> being good, but very much so. And for that
    reason I am glad Van der Weele is coming.</p>

    <p>Indeed, one can have a deep longing sometimes to talk things
    over with people who know about one's craft. Especially if each
    works and seeks in the same spirit, it is possible greatly to
    strengthen and animate each other, and one is not so easily
    discouraged. One cannot always live away from one's native
    land, and one's native land is not nature alone - there must
    also be human hearts who search for and feel the same things.
    And only then is the native land perfect only then does one
    feel at home.</p>

     This now is the composition of the refuse dump. I do not know
    how much you can make out. In the foreground, women are
    emptying dustbins; behind them are the sheds where the dung is
    kept, and the men at work with wheelbarrows, etc. The first one
    I made of it was a little different; there were two other men
    in the foreground with sou'westers, which they often wear in
    bad weather, and the group of women was darker.</p>

    <p>But that light effect is really there because the light
    falls from overhead between the sheds on the figures in the
    pathways. It would be a splendid thing to paint. I think you
    will understand all about it. I wish I could talk it over with
    Mauve. But perhaps it's better as it is, for it does not always
    help to get advice from somebody else, clever though he may be,
    and those who are cleverest are not always clever in explaining
    things clearly. I repeat, I hardly know myself what is best. In
    the first place, painting is not my principal object, and
    perhaps I will be ready for illustrating sooner all by myself
    than if somebody, who wouldn't think of illustrations at all,
    advised me. I get on best of all with Rappard.</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy. All best wishes and thank you for your timely
    help.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
