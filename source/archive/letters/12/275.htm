  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many warm thanks for your letter and the enclosure.<label content="Theo.mistress"> I was
    glad to hear some more details about your patient, the more so
    as the news seemed to be very favourable.</p>

    <p>What you write about her influence on other people is very
    charming.</label> I believe such things are true, the influence exerted
    by a good person is sometimes far reaching. Curiously enough,
    it has been compared to leaven. Two good people - man and woman
    combined - with the same intentions and object in life,
    actuated by the same serious purpose, what couldn't they
    accomplish!</p>

    <p>I have often thought of that.</p>

    <p>For, by co-operating, the power of goodness is not just
    doubled, but multiplied many times, as by involution, to use a
    mathematical term.</p>

    <p>Well - your description of the house and its surroundings,
    the cabstand, is very good; it has a more characteristic
    setting than your other descriptions of the city; the cabstand
    is excellent, can I have that personage with the red nose pose
    for me someday?</p>

    <p>I am glad you saw our friend Wisselingh again. So he has
    come back to Paris - is <i>he still with the firm of
    Cottier?</i></p>

    <p>Will you give him my best regards sometime? If he comes to
    Holland, a visit from him would give me great pleasure -
    indeed, he has already promised as much. I wish you could
    remind him, so that he won't forget. I should like to ask him
    several things about London. Did he happen to see my
    lithographs? I should like to renew his acquaintance - I always
    found much that was attractive in him, and he knows many
    things, and has original and correct sentiments in things of
    art; in short, he is a man of character.</p>

    <p>The enclosed scratch is from a drawing which I started early
    this morning, and I worked on it the whole day. Perhaps it is
    the best one I've made up till now, at least in light and
    shadow. I am sending you the little sketch because I think you
    will see from it how much I gained by the change of light in
    the studio. But it is impossible to work on this paper so that
    it gets the same values; the sketch hasn't the right
    proportions, and the drawing has more foreground. This figure
    is posed against the light, and to render it, one needs more
    than an outline because, as the light falls from a single
    window, the modelling becomes stronger, and the values become
    harmonious and related to each other. From this conception
    results first, the difficulty of rendering what one has before
    one's eyes, and second, something else which is rather
    difficult - that is, the problem of posing a figure and letting
    the light fall so that it renders the character most completely
    and strongly. The light in what one sees outside or inside must
    be analyzed so that one can find the same effect again.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I'm very glad to hear you found the crayon. It didn't arrive
    in today's mail, however, though you wrote you had sent it. If
    you have forgotten it, I remind you of it again, and if you
    have already sent it, it will certainly arrive soon. I have a
    new stock of lithographic crayon, and am going to combine it
    with drawing crayon, which I think <i>must</i> give good
    results.</label></p>

    <p>This week I was very busy drawing wheelbarrows; a little
    fellow viewed from the back came out quite well, I think. Van
    der Weele came to see me, and we had a private exhibition of
    wood engravings, seated cosily on a wheelbarrow, for I was just
    working with a model. He will begin to collect them too, and
    will try to get some from the collection of the late Stam, the
    wood engraver.</p>

    <p>I didn't tell you yet that I have almost the whole Graphic
    complete now, from the very beginning in 1870. Of course, not
    everything, there is too much chaff - but the best things from
    it. When one sees, for instance, Herkomer's work, arranged
    together instead of scattered among many insignificant things,
    it is, in the first place, easier and pleasanter to look at,
    but in addition, one learns to distinguish the characteristics
    of the various masters, and the great difference between the
    draughtsmen.</p>

    <p>How I should love to see something of Lhermitte's.</p>

    <p>I can't tell you enough how happy I am with the changes in
    the studio, and how full I am of all kinds of figures I want to
    make.</p>

    <p>Among the things Van der Weele saw were this winter's
    studies of heads. I am sure they will be of use to me later on,
    the same as the other studies. Do you know what pleased me this
    winter? You remember Van der Weele came to see me months ago,
    when I was doing studies of diggers, one of which I tried to
    make a lithograph of. He saw them at the time, but they didn't
    seem to interest him, definitely not. Now, recently, for the
    picture on which he's working, he has either had diggers pose
    for him or has observed them while they were at work - in fact
    he has studied diggers closely from nature.</p>

    <p>Now, in looking over my studies, when we came to the
    diggers, he spoke quite differently of them than he did last
    winter; at least, he wasn't so quick to say, &ldquo;This or
    that isn't right.&rdquo; I myself didn't mention them at all
    this time. But more and more I begin to notice in myself, as
    well as in others, how often one is mistaken in thinking this
    or that &ldquo;<i>isn't so</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>that's not
    correct&rdquo;</i> - how often one says it when it doesn't
    apply, I myself no less than others. One thinks one knows
    something for sure, and yet if one wants to be honest, one must
    take it back later.</p>

    <p>Your description of the cabstand and the ancient urinal with
    the posters on it is really very good - it's a real pity you
    don't draw it.</p>

    <p>Speaking of posters, the places where they are pasted up are
    sometimes a queer parody on the posters themselves, or the
    reverse.</p>

    <p>For instance, to quote one of many, over the entrance of the
    pawnshop, I saw a poster advertising in large characters</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Prospectus<br>
     Hearth and Home&rdquo;</p>

    <p>N.B. - Hearth and Home is a magazine, as you perhaps know. I
    thought it rather good; if one paid more attention, one might
    find even better ones.</p>

    <p>Gavarni once made something of it - it was the entrance to a
    house, over which was written, &ldquo;On prend des enfants en
    sevrage&rdquo; [Here children are minded]. Standing on the
    steps were a woman of very unfavorable appearance and a fellow
    with a cutty in his mouth, obviously the owners of the
    institution. Against the wall was stuck a poster:
    &ldquo;<i>Perdu</i> un enfant, tel et tel&rdquo; [<i>Lost</i>
    such and such a child].</p>

    <p>Another one is, &ldquo;Au rendezvous de la
    fraternit&eacute;&rdquo; [At the meeting place of
    brotherliness], the sign at an inn where a few tipsy fellows
    are scuffling.</p>

    <p>Rappard is going to send a large picture to the Amsterdam
    exhibition. It represents four tile painters around a table.
    Indirectly I've heard much good about it. Now, though it's not
    my intention to do large pictures for exhibitions, still I
    wouldn't like to do work inferior to Rappard's, for
    instance.</p>

    <p>I even find something animating in the thought that one
    works in one direction, the other in another, yet there is
    still mutual sympathy. Competition, when it proceeds from
    jealousy, is quite a different thing from trying one's best to
    make the work as good as possible, <i>out of mutual
    respect</i>. &ldquo;Les extr&ecirc;mes se touchent.&rdquo; I do
    not see any good in jealousy, but I would despise a friendship
    which did not call for some exertion on both sides to maintain
    the same level.</p>

    <p>The thing I begin to long very much for is to work with more
    models at a time. To do somewhat more complicated drawings. But
    the longing for it is not too intense, I have enough to do as
    it is.</p>

    <p>At Van der Weele's I saw the studies for his large picture.
    Those studies were excellent - conscientiously done, but one
    who understands a little how studies from nature are made, and
    knows the difference between these and the picture or ultimate
    composition, naturally doesn't expect to find the picture in
    the studies.</p>

    <p>No wonder the greatness and unity of the picture isn't in
    the studies; the studies are made for the figures - either
    horses or men, it doesn't matter - and the surroundings are
    neglected; for instance, there isn't enough background or
    foreground, etc. They do not stand out and are not <i>in their
    right places as they are in the picture</i>. Does everybody
    understand this when they look at studies? I hope you will keep
    it in mind when you see mine, especially when, sooner or later,
    you see the ones I still have here. This week, for fun, I
    sketched a few in different proportions, in such a way that I
    can make them into a whole. The thing which I would call
    picturesqueness came by itself, simply by stressing a few
    lines, and washing in a few flat tones with sepia. What I want
    to say is, don't think that with respect to space I look at
    nature with a different eye than, for instance, Van der
    Weele.</p>

    <p>Adieu. Write soon again, best wishes,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>In this little sketch you see something which I spoke about
    at the end of this letter. Now there is no foreground here at
    all, though in the real study there is a little more of it; but
    if I combined this study, for instance, with one of the
    diggers, let's say the one in the lithograph, then a large
    patch of ground would belong in front, and, for instance, a
    woody stretch behind, with a bit of sky visible quite high up,
    just to indicate where the light comes from. So that it would
    perhaps become a wide composition, and then the figure would be
    in its surroundings and in its place.</p>

    <p>If I put all this into the study itself, the figure would
    become so small that it would be of no use to me as a serious
    study of the figure. Believe me, the aspect is not the hardest
    thing; if my studies are good, I am quite confident of the
    rest.</p>

    <p><?showImage("324_V-T_2750");?>
     Space, atmosphere, and broadness are things which you mustn't
    think I neglect, but one mustn't <i>begin</i> with them; first
    the foundation, then the roof follows in time.</p>
