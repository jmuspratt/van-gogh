  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>About a week ago I sent you a little roll of wood engravings
    with a letter enclosed. Since then I have taken the Graphics
    apart.</p>

    <p>There was a preponderant reason that made it desirable.
    Looking through twenty-one volumes is a job that takes up too
    much time. Of course, there is a whole lot in it that leaves me
    indifferent and is only useless rubbish.</p>

    <p>I think it desirable, moreover, to keep the things by Small
    or Herkomer, or Green or Frank Hol, for instance, together,
    instead of having them scattered among things that do not match
    them in the least. When one has taken out only the best and
    most characteristic sheets, it is possible to get a general
    view of them within a few hours. And one does not need a long
    time to hunt up a particular thing.</p>

    <p>And so I have done it after all. And I have already sorted
    those I have taken out too - but I haven't mounted them
    yet.</p>

    <p>The bindings of the volumes can now serve as portfolios, and
    I am going to complete the collection of Graphic wood
    engravings by adding all the other things I have already.</p>

    <p>It means a lot of drudgery but it certainly is stimulating
    work - for I count myself a lucky fellow to have something so
    pleasant around the studio, now and forever.</p>

    <p>Of course I have quite a number of duplicates available.</p>

    <p>I have another kind of drudgery on my hands; the fact being
    that I have started a sort of battle with my landlord to get a
    number of privileges - I mean alterations in the studio. And of
    course it is not easy to get him to do something.</p>

    <p>And yet - I made a pact with him just now by which he
    granted me at least some of these privileges. He does not find
    it easy to get tenants for his houses, and what I asked him for
    was wood which he had no immediate need for.</p>

    <p>I assure you it is quite an advantage, for the studio will
    gain a lot by it. Well, I am glad I attacked him. I got the
    idea of starting a fight with him while reading Fritz Reuter's
    Ut mine Festungstid - perhaps you know the book - in which
    there is the highly funny story of the way in which Fritz R.
    and others who had been sentenced to detention in a fortress
    tricked the "town major" into granting them all kinds of
    advantages. <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Speaking of Reuter, don't you think that the figure of
    Br&auml;sig in Dried Herbs <sup>2</sup> is glorious - and his
    Havermann? I think it as beautiful as anything by Knaus and
    Vautier.</p>

    <p>I have been working recently on large figures (busts, or
    rather figures down to the knees), which are intended as
    staircase wall decorations. Six pieces on cardboard in black
    and white.</p>

    <p>It will be much easier to look through the wood engravings
    whenever you come here. You will be interested, for instance,
    in Boyd Houghton's &ldquo;Mormons,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Indians,&rdquo; some London sketches and a number of
    sheets about &ldquo;Paris during the Commune,&rdquo; perhaps
    thirty pieces in all. And some large compositions,
    &ldquo;Emigrants&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mormon Prayer
    Meeting.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I now have seven large sheets by du Maurier - first and
    foremost &ldquo;Dieppe Harbor,&rdquo; the finest of them all -
    you know it - and then &ldquo;Musical Rehearsal,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Rival Grandpas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Before Dinner&rdquo; -
    now in the Graphic portfolio &ldquo;Battle-dore and
    Shuttlecock,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sketch in the Monkey House&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;Cricket Match.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But there is also a &ldquo;Ladies' Boarding School,&rdquo;
    which I do <i>not</i> have; perhaps it occurs in the very first
    numbers of the Graphic<i>.</i></p>

    <p>Otherwise I have never seen any large compositions by him.
    The series is done by du Maurier and Miss Edw. Edwards M. E.
    F., and the latter has some sheets in it that are almost as
    beautiful as those by du Maurier himself.</p>

    <p>Do you know J. D. Linton (monogram JDL)? A crowd of females
    (during some &ldquo;Commune&rdquo;) he has drawn is superb.
    &ldquo;Jewish Synagogue,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tower&rdquo; etc., are
    also very striking. But you will greatly enjoy the Ch. Greens,
    large sheets, including a &ldquo;Hospital&rdquo; - benches full
    of patients - which is excellent.</p>

    <p>I am writing you because there was a letter in the little
    roll of wood engravings I sent you (which is really prohibited)
    - in it I thanked you for your package - and because of this
    you might not have got it.</p>

    <p>Is your recovery progressing? And have you gone back to your
    work completely? Adieu - write soon. I did receive your little
    roll, but no letter.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

        <p>The name of the Dutch translation of Reuter's complete
        works. Vincent means the novel <i>Ut mine Stromtid,</i> in
        which &ldquo;Uncle Br&auml;sig&rdquo; is a conspicuous
        humorous character.</p>
