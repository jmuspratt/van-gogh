    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I enclose a little sketch which I made in the soup kitchen.
    They sell the soup in a large passage where the light falls
    from above, through a door to the right.</p>

    <p>Now I tried to find that same effect in the studio. In the
    background I put a white screen, and on that I drew the hatch,
    according to its real position and measurements; I closed the
    farthest window entirely, and the middle window at the bottom,
    so that the light falls from <i>P</i>, exactly as in the place
    itself.</p>

    <p>You see, <art id=1020a>when I have the models posing there,</art> I get exactly
    the same effect as in the real soup kitchen.</p>

    <p>In the sketch above, you see the grouping in the studio. I
    have put a line around the part I wanted to draw.</p>

    <p><?showImage("318_V-T_2711");?>
    </p>

    <p>Of course I can study the poses of the figures as long and
    as much and as correctly as I like, yet generally remaining
    true to what I have seen.</p>

    <p>I should like to try this again in watercolour, for
    instance, and work hard on it to develop it more. It seems to
    me that there is more opportunity for figure painting in the
    studio now. Before the change, when I tried it last summer, the
    figures got such a neutral, cold tone that one didn't feel
    strongly inclined to paint them. The picturesqueness
    disappeared, so to speak, as soon as they came into that strong
    light.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I shall still need very much? Different
    pieces of grey or brown cloth, to get the right shade of
    background.</p>

    <p>In the above sketch, the wall is white, with wainscot
    painted grey, the floor, darker. By paying attention to those
    things, one gets the local colour so much more correctly. I
    have a few of these things already, and also many <i>real</i>
    clothes. Yesterday, for instance, I bought a very picturesque
    patched smock of coarse linen. I am always on the lookout for
    such things; by paying some attention to them, the models give
    more satisfaction than if one leaves it all to chance.</p>

    <p>I love my studio the way a sailor loves his ship. I know
    that in time it will become just what I want, but my purse
    doesn't always allow me to do what I should like. But the
    things which one buys in this way are things that last, and
    <i>now</i> I have a chance which perhaps I shouldn't get again
    later.</p>

    <p>The change in the studio brings even more expenses -
    indirectly rather than directly - for I won't consider it
    finished before I have many more things which are necessary to
    make it practical.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">Your patient will cause you a great deal of expense;</label> if you
    can't send anything extra just now, I needn't stop working
    because of that. Besides, not long ago you did send something
    extra, so I want to emphasize that I should be able to pull
    through if necessary. But I have a burning desire to push on,
    and to make progress.</p>

    <p>There is another thing spurring me on, namely that Rappard
    is also working at top speed, more than he used to, and I want
    to keep up with him, because then we'll get on better together,
    and can profit more from each other's experience.</p>

    <p>He has painted much more than I, and has drawn longer, but
    we are both on just about the same level. I don't try to
    compete with him as a painter, but I won't let him beat me in
    drawing. I wish that in the future he and I should keep working
    in the same direction, that is, types from the people, scenes
    in a soup kitchen, hospital, etc. He has promised to come to
    see me one of these days. I wish I could make some arrangement
    with him about making a series of drawings from the people,
    which we should lithograph <i>as soon as they are good
    enough</i> - not before.</p>

    <p>This and many other things give me a strong desire to push
    on vigorously.</p>

    <p><i>At all events</i>, whether you can send me something or
    not, I can promise you better drawings before long.</p>

    <p>The change in the studio itself, as far as it goes, enables
    me to undertake some new things already.</p>

    <p>But there would be fewer obstacles in the way, if you could
    send me something extra just now. I am afraid that otherwise I
    should be checked by some things, either by the lack of drawing
    materials or by not being able to take models, or by the making
    of a few more alterations.</p>

    <p>I mention &ldquo;better drawings,&rdquo; this is meant
    comparatively.</p>

    <p>Among the studies of heads - old men, etc. - which I still
    have, there are some which I will not be able to improve at
    once, because there is unquestionably some touch of nature in
    them, and at the same time something with which I am, of
    course, not quite satisfied; so I dare not say &ldquo;I shall
    do it better in a few days.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But I mean something else by &ldquo;better drawings,&rdquo;
    that is, drawn from a different point of view, and with more
    chiaroscuro in them, of which there is little or none in this
    winter's studies.</p>

    <p>At all events, one thing I can promise you now, tomorrow
    I'll have the house full of people, that is, the woman's
    mother, and her younger sister, and a boy from the
    neighbourhood, and all these persons, together with my own
    people, will pose for the drawing of which this is the first
    rough sketch.</p>

    <p>Rappard always works with models, too, and in my opinion
    there is no better way. Especially if one sticks to one model,
    one finds more and more qualities in it. So this letter
    complements yesterday's, in so far as you will see from it that
    today I made a plan for a new watercolour of the same kind I
    sent you, and that tomorrow I shall have the models for it. I
    hope to finish this one more thoroughly than the one I sent
    you. Shall I succeed? I can't tell beforehand.</p>

    <p>I started, though I am still short of a few things. But one
    thing I have now that I didn't have before, and that is the
    better light. And it is worth more to me than ever so many
    colours. If I can have the colours too, please let me have
    them; but I have had so many things from you already, and in
    many respects I am so little satisfied with the result, till
    now, that I hardly dare to ask for them. As in algebra the
    product of two negatives is a positive, so I hope that the
    product of <i>failures</i> may be <i>success</i>.</p>

    <p>Adieu. My best wishes for your patient, or rather, your
    convalescent.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
