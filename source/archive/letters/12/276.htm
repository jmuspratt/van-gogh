     The Hague, 21 -28 March 1883</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You have so often afforded me a glimpse of Paris with your
    descriptions, this time for a change I am giving you a glimpse
    out of my window at the snow-covered yard.</p>

    <p>I am adding a glimpse into a corner of the house, and they
    are two impressions of one and the same winter's day.</p>

    <p>We are surrounded by poetry on all sides, but putting it on
    paper is, alas, not as readily done as looking at it.</p>

    <p><art id=1022>I made a watercolour of the above</art>, from which this small
    sketch is taken, but I don't think it is vivid and powerful
    enough.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">I believe I've already written to you that I was able to
    find some mountain chalk here in the city. I am at work with
    that, as well.</label></p>

    <p>To my mind the cold spell we had last week was the most
    perfect part of this winter. It was fantastically beautiful,
    what with the snow and the curious skies. The thawing of the
    snow today was almost more beautiful still. But it was
    <i>typical</i> winter weather, if I may call it that - the kind
    of weather that awakens old memories and lends the most
    ordinary things the sort of look one cannot help associating
    with stories from the age of stagecoaches and post chaises.</p>

    <p>Here, for example, is a quick little sketch I made in just
    such a dream-like state. It shows a gentleman who, having
    missed a coach or something of the sort, has had to spend the
    night in a village inn. Now he has risen early, and having
    ordered a glass of brandy against the cold, he is paying the
    landlady (a little woman in a peasant's cap). It is still very
    early in the morning, la piquette du jour [the crack of dawn],
    - he must catch the post chaise - the moon is still shining and
    one can see the snow glittering through the taproom window, and
    all the objects are casting curious, whimsical shadows. This
    story is really of no consequence, nor is the little sketch,
    but one or another may perhaps help you to understand what I
    mean, that is, that lately everything has a certain je ne sais
    quoi, which makes one feel like getting it down quickly on
    paper. Still, the whole of nature is an indescribably beautiful
    Black and White exhibition during such snow effects.</p>

    <p>As I am doing small sketches at present anyway, I am adding
    another, very slight one, of a drawing done in mountain chalk,
    <art id=1024>the girl by the cradle</art>, done like <art id=1072>the woman
    and child you mention</art>. This mountain chalk is
    truly the strangest material. The other <art id=1010>little sketch of a
    bargee</art> is after a drawing in which a great deal has been lavis
    [washed] with neutral tint and sepia.</p>

    <p>It would not surprise me at all if the few things I sent you
    recently seem to you rather meager products. Indeed I believe
    it could hardly be otherwise. There is something inevitable
    about the fact that, to appreciate the characteristic nature of
    work in Black and White, one must take the whole set into
    account all the time, which cannot always be done. What I mean
    is that there is a difference between making 10 drawings and
    making 100 drawings or sketches or studies. Not because of the
    quantity, to be sure - forget about the quantity - what I am
    trying to say is this, there is a kind of tolerance to Black
    and White that enables one to draw a single figure one admires
    in perhaps 10 different poses, while if one were to do it in,
    say, watercolour, or to paint it, one would do just one
    pose.</p>

    <p>Now suppose 9 of those 10 are no good, and I hope in all
    conscience that this would not be the proportion of good to bad
    al the time, but just suppose that to be the case. If you were
    here in the studio yourself, it is my belief that not a week
    would pass without my being able to show you, not just one, but
    <i>a whole number</i> of studies, and I should be surprised if
    you were unable to pick out one from amongst that number that
    appealed to you every time. Meanwhile the rest would not have
    been done wholly in vain, since in some respects even
    unsuccessful studies are likely to prove useful or serviceable
    one day for some new composition.</p>

    <p>And that is why I think that the next time you come, you may
    well find a few more things about which you can give me a few
    tips. For instance, it is quite hard, since I am not at all
    familiar with Lhermitte's drawings (you will remember my asking
    you about them), but am familiar with Ciceri's watercolours as
    well as his old lithographic drawing examples, though not at
    all with his current black and white drawings, I repeat, it's
    quite hard for me to grasp your precise meaning when you write
    with reference to a certain little sketch, &ldquo;Couldn't you
    do something that would somehow fit in with the above-mentioned
    drawings?&rdquo; I'm sure that both those artists are
    infinitely more advanced than I - but your idea could be
    feasible and I myself will keep learning too, don't you agree?
    - so it's not beyond the bounds of possibility. And I wanted to
    emphasize to you again that, in my opinion, supposing I do
    produce something that would fit in, there is a sort of
    tolerance to Black and White which would allow one to become
    very productive in that direction, once one has embarked on it.
    Not without working unremittingly, of course, but I do that
    anyway.</p>

    <p>So if the small drawings in mountain chalk I sent you are
    not what you intended, although I had your tips in mind when I
    did them, don't let that put you off and don't hesitate to
    return to the subject, the more often the better. And bear in
    mind, too, that as soon as I am sure of what you are after, I
    shall be ready to do as I said just now, to turn out 10, for
    example, in order to arrive at one good one. In short, if you
    do come to the studio one day, I think you would see that I am
    being fairly energetic, and you would, I hope, go on thinking
    of me in these terms, wouldn't you, and you would understand as
    well that even though someone who is fairly energetic may be
    working hard for himself, or rather without an immediate
    purpose, it might be twice as stimulating for him if there were
    a purpose. This is also true of possible work for the
    illustrated papers.</p>

    <p>I immensely enjoyed rereading Fritz Reuter's <i>Gedroogde
    kruiden</i> [Dried Herbs, the Dutch translation of Reuter's
    S&auml;mtliche Werke (Complete Works)] recently, it is just
    like, say, Knaus or Vautier.</p>

    <p>Do you know a draughtsman by the name of R&eacute;gamey?
    There is a lot of character in his work, I have got some
    woodcuts, including drawings made in prison, and gypsies and
    Japanese. When you come, you must have another look at the
    woodcuts, I've acquired a few new ones since last time.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.love">It may well seem to you that the sun is shining more
    brightly and that everything has taken on a new charm. That, at
    any rate, is the inevitable consequence of true love, I
    believe, and it is a wonderful thing. And I also believe that
    those who hold that no one thinks clearly when in love are
    wrong, for it is at just that time that one thinks very clearly
    indeed and is more energetic than one was before. And love is
    something eternal, it may change in aspect but not in essence.
    And there is the same difference between someone who is in love
    and what he was like before as there is between a lamp that is
    lit and one that is not. The lamp was there all the time and it
    was a good lamp, but now it is giving light as well and that is
    its true function. And one has more peace of mind about many
    things and so is more likely to do better work.</label></p>

    <p>How beautiful those old almshouses are, I can't find words
    to describe them. And though Isra&euml;ls does this sort of
    thing to perfection, so to speak, I find it strange that so
    <i>relatively</i> few should have an eye for it. Every day here
    in The Hague, so to speak, I see a world which very many people
    pass by and which is very different from what most make of it.
    And I shouldn't dare to say so if I didn't know from experience
    that figure painters, too, actually <i>pass it by</i>, and if I
    didn't remember that whenever I was struck by some figure or
    other I encountered while out walking with them, I would hear
    time and again, &ldquo;oh, those dirty people,&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;that kind of person&rdquo; - expressions, in short, one
    would not expect from a painter.</p>

    <p>Yes, that often used to make me think. I remember, for
    instance, a conversation with Henkes, who frequently saw, and
    sees, things so clearly, which took me completely by surprise.
    It is as if they deliberately shun the most serious, the most
    beautiful things, in short voluntarily muzzle themselves and
    clip their own wings. And while I am gradually acquiring
    greater respect for some, I cannot help thinking that others
    will be reduced to sterility if they go on like that. And the
    old <i>Boh&egrave;me</i> was very insistent on this very point,
    on being productive. And, and &ldquo;La Boh&egrave;me&rdquo;
    was no good, according to some, but mind you, there will always
    be those who want to have their cake and eat it and, and, and
    who will end up with jam on their faces. Snuff out the candle -
    que soit [so be it] - but there is no point in applying the
    snuffer prematurely. Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>
