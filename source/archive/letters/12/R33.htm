    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I received the package of wood engravings on March 30; as
    there was no accompanying letter, I waited a few days to see
    if you were going to write me. Now, however, I shall write you
    a few words to thank you very much for this batch, and to tell
    you that I found several sheets among them that I did not have
    myself (among other things, &ldquo;A Ghost Story&rdquo; by
    Thomas, &ldquo;Christmas Carol&rdquo; by Gilbert, Oberlander's
    &ldquo;In der Kirche&rdquo; [In church], etc.).</p>

    <p>I gave the other ones to Van der Weele, who was very glad to
    have them. I imagine you will be very busy with the picture you
    intend for the exhibition. When everything connected with it is
    finished, I shall look forward eagerly to the resumption of our
    correspondence about lithography and black and white in
    general, and - if it is possible - no less to getting together
    with you.</p>

    <p>I am writing you only a short letter this time, as I can
    understand that you are very busy.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">Just one thing, though. What do you think of the following
    method for making drawings in black and white? You make a
    drawing, either with lead pencil or with charcoal. Put as much
    vigour into it as you can, but without worrying about the
    weakness or inadequacy of the effect. When you have done this,
    you put a little ordinary printer's ink on a palette, then a
    little Cassel earth, for instance, and also white - oil paint.
    With these - mixing the colours and the printer's ink, which is
    as thick as tar in its ordinary state, with <i>turpentine</i>
    (no oil, of course) - you start to attack the original drawing
    again - with the brush, of course. This is something I tried
    out the other day.</label> <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">It goes without saying that the <i>printer's ink</i> -
    diluted with more or less turpentine (you can dilute it until
    it is so thin that you can wash with it with the utmost
    transparency - on the other hand, one can use it in so thick a
    condition that one gets the deepest black tones) - is the
    principal ingredient you use. I think this is a method with
    which much can be done. Well, more about it later on - I am
    still experimenting myself.</label></p>

    <p>The drawing I am working on now with this method is an
    <i>orphan</i> man standing near a coffin - in what they call
    the &ldquo;corpses' den.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake, and thanks again for what you sent
    me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>It stands to reason that, in order to simplify things, you
    could experiment with printers' ink and turpentine only. This
    time, however, I don't mean autographic ink, but ordinary
    printer's ink. Perhaps you have it already, otherwise you can
    get it at any printing office.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">It is my experience that this printer's ink clings very
    nicely to the coarse grain of a certain paper which is called
    papier torchon here (but which is nothing like the Whatman
    torchon); Smulders ordered it again a short while ago in two
    sizes, the large size 3.75 guilders per quire.</label></p>
