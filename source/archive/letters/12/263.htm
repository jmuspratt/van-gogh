  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am again anxious for your letter; as it is already
    February 3 (and the postman for today has passed), I write you
    as a precaution. If you have written a few days later than
    usual, it's all right, but remembering what happened with that
    letter this winter, I'm telling you in case you wrote before
    the first.</p>

    <p>Then you would perhaps do well to inquire.</p>

    <p>I have noticed that the postman sometimes gives letters for
    the Schenkweg to people who live there, instead of delivering
    them himself. It is sometimes a big detour for the postman; I
    know it because now and then the man has asked me to deliver a
    few things for him - which I did, of course, but I couldn't
    help thinking of the letter that got lost. Well!</p>

    <p>The weather has been very stormy here these days, especially
    last night. It will be very rough at sea.</p>

    <p>How is your patient? From what you write, I see things that
    touch me deeply, that are really noble (for instance, that
    <i>she</i> paid the debts of the man who deceived her).</p>

    <p>That not being &ldquo;at home&rdquo; of the Deputy reminded
    me of the name Punch gives to the secretary for home affairs
    (the &ldquo;Home Secretary&rdquo; is his title). Punch always
    calls this personage the &ldquo;<i>seldom-at-home</i>&rdquo;
    secretary. How many of those &ldquo;seldom-at-home&rdquo;
    people there are. And Dickens called the lot of them the
    &ldquo;circumlocution office.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Many people are standing sighing before the door of those
    &ldquo;how-not-to-do-it&rdquo; institutions, and the sighs
    there are no less deep, perhaps, than they were on the old
    Bridge of Sighs.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">I have been feeling very weak lately. I am afraid I have
    been overworking myself, and how miserable the
    &ldquo;dregs&rdquo; of the work are, that depression after
    overexertion. Life is then the colour of dishwater; it becomes
    something like an ash heap.</p>

    <p>On such a day one would like to have the company of a
    friend. That sometimes clears up the leaden mist.</p>

    <p>On such days I am sometimes terribly worried about the
    future and am melancholy about my work, and feel quite
    helpless.</p>

    <p>But it is dangerous to speak or think too much about it, so
    enough of it.</label></p>

    <p>In spite of this, I have been working on a watercolour,
    another sketch of diggers, or rather, road menders, here on the
    Schenkweg; but it's rotten.<label content="art.technique"> I also drew a few figures with
    crayon which I think are better.</p>

    <p>Not just with crayon, but the whole thing sponged, and the
    shadows softened, the lights intensified.</label></p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">Maybe I have caught cold - at all events I must get rid of
    that depression before I can do anything properly.</label></p>

    <p>I am reading Ut mine Festungstid [From the Time of my
    Detention in a Fortress] by Fritz Reuter; it is very witty. The
    Germans have their special humour, quite different from that of
    the English. Herkomer has painted among other things a
    peasant's carnival, something like Peasant Brueghel, which has
    this humour very strongly.</p>

    <p>Speaking of Herkomer, some time ago I read a kind of
    biography of him, though rather incomplete. But the following
    struck me.</p>

    <p>For some time he lived and painted in an empty house, or one
    that wasn't finished perhaps, because he couldn't pay any
    rent.</p>

    <p>Then he came to the Graphic and was relatively free of care.
    But even when employed there, he was still but little
    respected. So little that his first sketch of the<art id=erkomer2> &ldquo;Last
    Muster at Chelsea Hospital&rdquo; - a drawing which differs
    relatively little from the final composition, but has a certain
    rough aspect - was almost rejected</art>.</p>

    <p><i>Nobody</i> in the Graphic administration approved of it
    except the manager (it would greatly astonish me if this
    manager were still on the job).</p>

    <p>Through his efforts the sketch was published, and he asked
    Herkomer if he could do it for him again, more elaborately.</p>

    <p>So this is the origin of a picture which has since gained
    the wonder and admiration of the best, in Paris as well as in
    London.</p>

    <p>Now almost everybody would admire the first sketch, too.</p>

    <p>The biography also tells that he is <i>not</i> a man who
    works easily; on the contrary, ever since the beginning he has
    had to struggle with a kind of awkwardness, and no picture is
    finished without severe mental effort.</p>

    <p>I can hardly understand why, even now, many call him rough.
    I can hardly think of any work more profoundly sensitive than
    his.</p>

    <p>When you come, I will show you the wood engravings of the
    almshouse for women; it is not so well known, but no less
    beautiful than that of the old men's. Something like the
    &ldquo;Sewing Class at Katwijk&rdquo; by Isra&euml;ls.</p>

    <p>Well, write soon, if you haven't done so already.</p>

    <p>I am anxious to know how your patient is. My best wishes for
    her and for everything. Also, my congratulations on Father's
    birthday. I sent Father a drawing which I had done in line with
    his criticism of the first lithography of the old man. Not
    because I thought Father was exactly right, but I thought, Now
    I know how you would like to have it, I will try and make it
    that way for you. But I'm afraid I didn't succeed. Even though
    one tries hard, one doesn't always succeed in pleasing other
    people. Father didn't exactly write that he didn't like it, but
    it was between the lines. It may be that it wasn't good after
    all. Well, they will show it to you whenever you go there, but
    don't mention it to them. Adieu.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
