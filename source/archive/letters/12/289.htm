    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I must tell you that this evening Van der Weele came to see
    my drawings. His opinion was favourable, and I am very glad of
    it.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I have done - in regard to the necessity of
    earning some money if possible? I have sent small sketches of
    both compositions to C. M. I wish this may perhaps result in
    his helping to carry out my plan of making a series of drawings
    of the work in the dunes.</p>

    <p>Then I thought that perhaps these drawings would be
    something for Cottier. I imagine they would look well, placed
    in the panels of a large cabinet over a mantelpiece, in a
    wainscot - in short, framed in woodwork as they do in England,
    and elsewhere too. But you know how it is with Cottier, when
    there is a certain degree of style in a drawing he likes it
    well enough, but alas, he generally pays little. Still, I
    believe he is one of those who would care for them; and
    besides, he could display the drawings favourably.</p>

    <p>Then, couldn't you show the sketches to our friend
    Wisselingh, and tell him I think they would look well framed in
    woodwork? At all events, urge him to visit my studio, if
    perchance he might come to The Hague. For if he might find them
    suitable for such a purpose, I could perhaps make an
    arrangement with him for more of them; and if I knew he cared
    for them, I could perhaps make them even more suitable for that
    purpose by trying to give them a decidedly decorative
    character.</p>

    <p><?showImage("344_V-T_2890");?>
     This morning I was already out-of-doors at four o'clock. I
    intend to attack the dustmen, or rather the attack has already
    begun. This drawing requires <art id=1032>studies of horses,</art> and I made two
    of them today, in the stables of the Rhine railway station: and
    probably I shall get an old horse at the refuse dump. That
    refuse dump is a splendid thing, but very complicated and
    difficult, and it will cost me a lot of hard work. I made a few
    sketches very early in the morning: the one that gives a vista
    of a brilliant little spot of fresh green will ultimately be
    the one, I think.</p>

    <p>It is somewhat like the scratch I made here; everything,
    even the women in the foreground and the white horses in the
    background, must stand out in chiaroscuro against the little
    bit of green, with a streak of sky above it. So that all those
    gloomy sheds, gliding away, one after the other, and all that
    dirt and those grey figures are in contrast to something pure
    and fresh.</p>

    <p>A group of women and a horse form the lighter part in the
    tone of the chiaroscuro, and the dustmen and the dung heaps,
    the darker.</p>

    <p>In the foreground, all kinds of broken and discarded
    objects, bits of old baskets, a rusty street lamp, broken pots,
    etc.</p>

    <p>So many ideas and such an desire to make new ones arose in
    me while making these first two drawings, that I do not know
    where to start, but I am definitely going to stick to the ash
    dump now.</p>

    <p>Well, Theo, we must keep good courage and try to work on
    energetically. We may be hard up sometimes and not know how to
    make both ends meet, but that does not matter and cannot be
    avoided; he who perseveres often conquers.</p>

    <p>And just now when it is doubly difficult for you to send the
    money, there is perhaps a real chance to sell something: if
    only you were here! I also thought, if he did not stick to his
    idea of not having anything to do with me, Tersteeg might
    perhaps have some use for these compositions on a smaller
    scale, for instance, in sepia. If only you were here, you might
    perhaps make some arrangement with him. I certainly do not
    refuse to take the trouble to make things, but as long as
    things are not right with Tersteeg and C. M. and I have no
    source of income whatever except the money from you, do your
    utmost, for I think everything depends on my working
    energetically just now.</p>

    <p>Though I have hardly any money left, I have already made
    arrangements with the models for this new drawing, and with
    what is left for the moment I will perhaps get a Scheveningen
    bonnet and cape today. If I can get hold of that patched cape,
    boy, I have my woman's figure for the first plane of the
    drawing of the dustmen - I am sure of it; and it is a start to
    making other figures of women for Scheveningen drawings.</p>
