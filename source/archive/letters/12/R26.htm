    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Yesterday I assembled some duplicates which I have found
    since I sent you the last ones. But all this has nothing to do
    with the Graphics<i>,</i> which for the time being I am going
    to leave in the condition they were in when I got them,
    although I feel strongly inclined to mount the sheets as soon
    as I have time and mounting board.</p>

    <p>I think you will probably appreciate R&eacute;gamey's
    &ldquo;Convicts, Outdoor Work.&rdquo; I'm sorry I have no
    duplicates of the other &ldquo;Convicts&rdquo; or of some other
    sheets representing &ldquo;A Stroll&rdquo; and &ldquo;A
    Dinner,&rdquo; which are surprisingly soberly done, and
    possibly even fuller in character than this one. I think
    Hopkins's &ldquo;Boat Race&rdquo; and &ldquo;Weather&rdquo; are
    reminiscent of Percy Macquoid, if I may say so. How much
    character there is in them, and what a peculiar daylight
    tone.</p>

    <p>Can you guess who did &ldquo;The First Warm Days&rdquo;?
    Beautiful, isn't it? The little Jules F&eacute;rats,
    &ldquo;Prisons d'autrefois et d'aujourd'hui&rdquo; [Prisons of
    the Past and Present], harmonize well with the little Renouards
    of Majos.</p>

    <p>If there should be some among them <i>that you already
    have</i><i>,</i> please return them sometime, but there's no
    hurry, of course.</p>

    <p>Now I have a duplicate of a large Heilbuth, &ldquo;Au Bord
    de l'eau&rdquo; [At the Waterside], which has a little figure
    of a lady sitting on a log; this detail and the title will
    probably enable you to verify whether or not you have it
    already. I have not sent it because I feel <i>almost</i> sure
    you have it - yet I am in doubt, and it is very beautiful, so
    please look it up.</p>

    <p>That sheet by Dodd harmonizes quite nicely with Green's
    &ldquo;Signboard Painter.&rdquo; &ldquo;Poor Irish
    Scholar&rdquo; is another one by that same M. F. who did the
    &ldquo;Merthyr Tydfil Pawn Office.&rdquo; However small this
    print may be, it's marvelously good, isn't it?</p>

    <p>I don't know who did the little Irish sketches
    &ldquo;Arch,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cottage&rdquo; and &ldquo;Labourer's
    Home,&rdquo; but I think particularly the last one excellent.
    Well, this is no more than a few things jumbled together.</p>

    <p>I think &ldquo;Good Friday&rdquo; is by Barnes. It just
    occurs to me that for a long time now I have had a fine
    portrait by Corot ready for you; I shall add it to the others
    at once. Whenever I have time I rummage among those
    Graphics<i>;</i> there are treasures in them</p>

    <p>I am writing in a hurry; I have collected these sheets while
    tidying up the studio. I hope there will be something that you
    will like among them.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
