  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Your letter and the enclosure were as welcome as ever. And
    as always, many thanks.</p>

    <p>And I appreciate it the more for knowing how many cares you
    have yourself.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">In some ways what you write about your patient isn't news,
    but in other ways it is. That you have written our parents
    about it, or rather, that you are going to, is something which
    will set your own mind at rest, and it is the right thing to
    do. Of course I never breathed a word of the affair, and you
    may rest assured that neither at home nor anywhere else shall I
    hint that I knew something about it in the past, nor that I am
    acquainted with intimate details. I think I shall act as though
    I heard about it only the other day, and then only
    superficially. But it is unlikely that anybody will discuss it
    with me.</label></p>

    <p>So you may be easy in your mind about this.</p>

    <p>Well, from the bottom of my heart I hope that things will
    turn out the way you planned them, toward October, and I am
    glad things have been carried so far, heartily glad for
    <i>your</i> sake as well as for <i>hers</i>. I think it
    is well as it is - especially <i>because I know</i> all the
    details - if two persons meet in this way they should not part
    company again.</p>

    <p>And I sincerely hope you will be able to come to Holland
    with her next summer. Who knows whether it might not help to
    set right certain things concerning my own woman.</p>

    <p>And so the Salon has opened. I suppose you will have a visit
    from Mr. Tersteeg and C. M. one of these days. It is now almost
    a year since I had differences with him, that is to say, with
    Tersteeg. I will not cross his path again; he must have noticed
    that, I think; and he may be sure that I hardly ever think of
    what has happened.</p>

    <p>If Tersteeg begins talking to you about me, you might cut it
    short by saying, &ldquo;Has Vincent ever troubled you or
    crossed your path since then? He hasn't, so don't you bother
    him either.&rdquo; It is rather unpleasant for me that, because
    of that quarrel with Tersteeg, I must always avoid the Goupil
    gallery out of discretion. You remember what Tersteeg wrote
    Father about me at the time - his opinion that I had made it
    impossible for him to have anything to do with me; he has not
    taken it back up to now.</p>

    <p>Of course, as long as he has that opinion of me, I will not
    enter his place again. Not because I am afraid of meeting
    Tersteeg, not because I want to hide myself from him or
    anything like that, but because I do not want to give any
    offense. If somebody wants to cut me, I myself will lend him a
    helping hand, and try to avoid the rare occasions when we might
    happen to meet. For the rest, I shall never contradict his
    opinion. From a certain point of view, Tersteeg is not wrong -
    but things may be looked at from another angle - they might be
    viewed in a way different from his - but that is his own
    business.</p>

    <p>For my part, I have expressed my opinion of him to you - but
    as far as I know, to nobody else - influenced by various very
    disagreeable circumstances, differences with Mauve, etc. I
    readily agree that because of all these things, my judgement of
    him was not correct either, and provided that Tersteeg takes
    back what he wrote Father about me - that I had made it
    impossible for him to have anything to do with me in the future
    - I retract my opinion that Tersteeg was the cause of the
    unpleasant things which happened to me.</p>

    <p>If I express myself clearly enough, you will perhaps find in
    this acknowledgement something which may lead to more peace or
    to a better understanding, to which I would be far from
    indifferent.</p>

    <p>When I think back to May of last year, Theo, the year has
    not been exactly easy or free from care for me, has it? But
    that doesn't matter. To be without care or trouble has indeed
    never been my ideal or intention. But things have not been
    exactly easy for me.</p>

    <p>What you send me is not little but much; but though it was
    perhaps much more than you could really spare yourself, I
    assure you that going on and making progress with my work, and
    keeping the household going, is not child's play for the woman
    and me. Now it is sometimes very hard on me that because of
    such strained relations, I must avoid the very persons with
    whom, for my work, I ought to be directly or indirectly in
    touch. And I wish it were peacefully settled.</p>

    <p>Well - for the moment I cannot change it.</p>

    <p>I am working on several things just now which I must carry
    through; but really I am very hard up. You write about Rappard
    - I am so sorry that he did not come when he wrote he would. If
    I asked him to advance me something, I am sure he would not
    refuse. For he himself proposed it this winter, but then he
    fell ill and we could not correspond about the matter for which
    the money was intended - that is, lithographs, and drawings
    connected with it. I remember his father wrote: &ldquo;My son
    is ill, but I know about it; if you are perhaps in
    difficulties, I will advance you the money.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I thought that so nice of Rappard's father that it would
    have been indelicate of me to have accepted it at that moment.
    So I wrote him, &ldquo;Thank you, let us wait for the recovery
    of your son.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Rappard recovered, but I heard nothing more about it, and he
    became absorbed in other work. So that is still hanging, and
    again and again there are obstacles which prevent carrying this
    thing through. But I personally did go on with it, namely
    making drawings in printer's ink, lithographic crayon, etc.,
    and I have had a lot of expenses too. Of course he is not in
    the least responsible for that: but what I want to say is, it
    is that much more reason, I think, for his not refusing to
    advance me something.</p>

    <p>Therefore I will ask him to do so, but I am expecting a
    letter from him: and before I have described the whole thing
    and have got an answer, some time may elapse, for he is lazy
    about his correspondence sometimes.</p>

    <p>When your money arrived this morning, I had been without
    money - absolutely without a penny - for about a week.<label content="art.support"> Besides,
    all my drawing material was used up. I was negotiating with
    Smulders about a lot of drawing paper and took it, though I
    cannot really afford it right now; but I absolutely needed it,
    together with other materials, for instance, the printer's ink
    of the engravers, and lithographic crayon.</label> And I had to pay for
    several household things and to lay in provisions. And had to
    pay the models, whom I had had meanwhile, in order to be able
    to work on.</p>

    <p>I am very, very sorry I have to ask for it, but if there is
    the slightest possibility, send me another 10 francs. A week's
    work depends on it, for I cannot expect an answer from Rappard
    right away. I am already hard up, and have made arrangements
    with models. After Rappard sends me the money, the time will
    come when things will run smoothly again. If you can send it,
    this week will pass without a hitch; if not, the damage will be
    unpleasant. But do not be angry with me; it was a combination
    of expenses, all strictly necessary, which I could not avoid.
    And if you cannot send it - well, it will not kill us. The
    difficulties in small matters, even when small sums of money
    are involved, are often really brain-wracking, and this is such
    a case. I hope Rappard will be able to help me a little, for I
    need it as much as a meadow needs the rain after a long
    drought.</p>

    <p>Well, once more my best wishes for your patient; the weather
    is delightful here at times - in your country it will be
    beautiful too, and will do her good.</p>

    <p>Adieu,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
