  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Thanks very much for your letter and the list of the wood
    engravings you found. I am very eager to see some of them,
    especially those by <i>De Groux</i> and
    <i>Lan&ccedil;on</i><i>.</i> The news that your health is
    improving so rapidly delights me. <sup>1</sup> You'll remember
    that before your illness we carried on a rather brisk
    correspondence about lithographs, and then we had to stop this
    correspondence.</p>

    <p>Since then I have been working rather hard - not directly on
    stone, but with lithographic crayon; it is an excellent
    material.</p>

    <p>If my letters bother you somewhat, don't think ill of me;
    and as for you, do write often, for you will have to make up
    for lost time - although as far as that goes your illness, and
    not yourself, is at fault.</p>

    <p>I assure you that the Graphics I have now are amazingly
    interesting. More than ten years ago, when I was in London, I
    used to go every week to the show windows of the printing
    offices of the Graphic and the London News to see the new
    issues. The impressions I got on the spot were so strong that,
    notwithstanding all that has happened to me since, the
    drawings are clear in my mind. Sometimes it seems to me that
    there is no stretch of time between those days and now - at
    least my enthusiasm for those things is rather stronger than it
    was even then. I haven't the slightest doubt that you won't
    regret coming to look at them.</p>

    <p>I know that you don't look upon Black and White the way most
    Dutchmen do; and, although I don't know exactly whether you
    intend to express yourself in this medium, still I believe that
    you have no prejudice against it. One need not exclude the
    other, and in many cases Black and White is a method that makes
    it possible to put on paper, relatively swiftly, effects that
    would otherwise lose something of what is called
    &ldquo;spontaneity.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I doubt whether, if the &ldquo;London Sketches&rdquo; - for
    instance, Herkomer's &ldquo;Low Lodginghouse St. Giles&rdquo;
    or Fildes's &ldquo;Casual Ward&rdquo; - were to be painted,
    they would be quite as full of feeling and character as they
    are now in that unpolished Black and White.</p>

    <p>There is something virile in it - something rugged - which
    attracts me strongly. And there is another thing - perhaps the
    master of Black and White is someone who neither you nor I
    knows. In the &ldquo;General Report&rdquo; of the exhibitions I
    see mention of the work of L'Hermite<sup>2</sup> - a Frenchman
    who is doing scenes of the fisherman's life in Brittany. They
    say of him that he is &ldquo;the Millet and Jules Breton of
    Black and White,&rdquo; and his name keeps reappearing over and
    over again. I should like to see something of his work; the
    other day I wrote about it to my brother, who has provided me
    with sound information more than once (e.g. about Dau-mier' s
    paintings).</p>

    <p>As for my lithographs - the one of the fellow sitting on a
    basket cutting his bread is a failure [F 1663, JH 272]. <label content="art.technique">When I
    transferred it to the stone the upper half got all blurred - I
    have been able to remedy the worst part with the scraper. Yet
    you will see that there are things in it which prove one can
    work vigorously with this process and express the nature of
    materials, as for instance the basket, the trousers and the
    muddy boots.</label> And though at first I thought it a sorry abortion,
    I have become somewhat reconciled to it since then, and if I
    were to start over again, I should do it in the same vigorous
    way - with a background.</p>

    <p>I remember reading in Herkomer's biography <sup>3</sup> how
    in his early days (when that incident with the rough sketch of
    <art id=erkomer2>&ldquo;Sunday at Chelsea Hospital&rdquo;</art> occurred) he did his
    utmost to find among the artists of that time men who would be
    willing to do types from the people too. Then he found Gregory,
    who started out by doing sketches of the Franco-German War
    (&ldquo;Paris under the Red Flag&rdquo; - I did not know at
    first that this sheet had been done by him - and also
    &ldquo;Ambulance in the Pit of a Theater&rdquo;), and later on
    specialized more in shipboard scenes - Gregory and Herkomer
    have remained friends since then.</p>

    <p>Now that you write me about your improving health, I am
    reminded of when I was recuperating last summer. There is
    something dating from that time that I want to tell you;
    perhaps I wrote you about it at the time, but I am not sure. Do
    you remember the woman we met when you visited me during the
    summer, whom I said was a model I had found, adding that I had
    discovered that she was pregnant, for which reason I was trying
    all the harder to help her.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">It was shortly afterward that I fell ill myself. At that
    point she was in the hospital at Leyden, and I got a letter
    from her in the clinic where I was, telling me she was in great
    trouble. Before that time - during the winter, when she was in
    a very bad way indeed - I had done what I could, and now I had
    a fierce inner struggle trying to decide what to do. Could I -
    <i>should</i> I help? - I was ill myself, and the future looked
    so dark. For all that, I got up against the doctor's wishes and
    went to see her.</label> I visited her in the hospital at Leyden on
    July 1. The night before, she had given birth to a little boy,
    who was lying asleep in his little cradle by her bedside, his
    little turned-up nose just outside the covers - unconscious, of
    course, of what was going on in the world. At least a poor
    struggler of a sick painter like myself knows a few things that
    a tiny baby like that doesn't know<i>.</i></p>

    <p>And what should I do? - I had some hard thinking to do at
    that moment. The mother, poor creature, had had a very
    difficult confinement. Aren't there moments in life when it is
    criminal to remain impassive and say, What business is it of
    mine?</p>

    <p>At any rate I told the woman, &ldquo;When you have
    recovered, come to me; whatever I can do for you I shall
    do.&rdquo; Well, my dear friend, that woman had another child,
    a sickly, neglected chit of a girl. It was an undertaking which
    exceeded my means rather more seriously than buying an issue of
    the Graphic<i>,</i> for instance - but what was I to do? After
    all, a man has a heart in his body, and if we did not take a
    chance now and then we should not deserve to be alive. So she
    came to me - I moved into a house that was not yet quite
    finished at the time, and that I could get at a relatively low
    rent; I am still living there, two doors down from my old
    studio; the number is 138. So here we are, the only difference
    being that the baby from the hospital cradle no longer sleeps
    as much as he did those first days.</p>

    <p>He is now about seven or eight months old and has become a
    charming little fellow, very much alive and kicking. When they
    moved in, I carried his cradle home from the secondhand shop on
    my shoulders, and all through the dark winter this little child
    has been like a light in the house. And though the woman does
    not have a strong constitution, and though notwithstanding this
    she has to work hard to keep the house clean, yet she has
    become stronger. So you see, while I'm trying to penetrate more
    deeply into art, I'm doing the same with respect to life itself
    - and the two things go together.</p>

    <p>It does not surprise me very much that I had my share of
    botheration with former friends who did not want to see me any
    longer. But fortunately this was not the case with my best
    friend - I mean my brother - for he and I are far more friends
    than brothers, and he is a man who can understand such things -
    more than that, who has helped and is still helping many
    unfortunates. I have lost some friends through it, all the
    same, but on the other hand I have more light and shade in my
    own house, although at times, when my worries become too great,
    I feel as if I were on a ship during a hurricane. But you see,
    although I well know that the sea has its dangers, and that one
    can drown in it, still I love the sea; and, notwithstanding all
    the perils that the future may hold, I have a certain
    serenity.</p>

    <p>Now I am anxious to talk with you again, and I should be
    delighted if you could see your way to coming to look at the
    Graphics before long. But I am writing you in advance to tell
    you of the changes in my household because I do not know
    exactly what your opinion of such contingencies of life is.</p>

    <p>If we were living in the days of the
    &ldquo;Boh&egrave;me,&rdquo; a painter's family and a studio
    like mine would be nothing unusual. But nowadays we are very
    far removed from the original &ldquo;Boh&egrave;me,&rdquo; and
    among painters one finds considerations of respectability which
    I personally do not precisely understand, although I do not
    want to offend those who cling to them.</p>

    <p>I repeat, if we were living in the days of the
    &ldquo;Boh&egrave;me,&rdquo; I should let things slide, but
    now, my friend Rappard, I will tell you frankly, I am living
    with a poor woman and two children, and there are many who, for
    that or some other reason, do not wish to associate with me,
    which makes it my duty to write you in this way. Won't you come
    and look at the Graphics one of these days?</p>

    <p>To this I must add that, when my father first heard of all
    these happenings, he was far from pleased - as you may well
    understand - or rather, not having expected such a thing of me,
    he did not know what to make of it. But after a while we saw
    each other again, which had not happened since I came here, as
    I left home after a lot of trouble. And he changed his original
    opinion when he knew more about it. The disagreement I had with
    him when I left home did not last long - we had made it up
    before I began living with this woman. And then, even though I
    was living with this woman, my father came to see me once.</p>

    <p>But how many misunderstandings there are in life, and how
    much more smoothly everything would go if people co-operated a
    bit more instead of quarreling.</p>

    <p>Oh, my dear fellow, how I wish that there was something more
    left of the old &ldquo;Boh&egrave;me&rdquo; in society and
    particularly among painters.</p>

    <p>Don't think that they won't come to see me just because of
    that woman. It is certainly <i>one</i> of the reasons, but it
    is mostly because of the painting itself, although last summer
    I <i>did</i> paint a number of studies. In short, I am sorely
    disappointed in my association with painters. Will it
    improve???</p>

    <p>Not long ago a painter here - Boks, a landscapist - was sent
    to the lunatic asylum. It was very difficult to get help for
    him before he was sent there, although during his illness he
    really did get some help, especially through Mauve's
    intervention. Now that he has been locked up, everybody is
    speaking of him with great sympathy and calling him very
    clever.</p>

    <p>For instance, a certain person, who repeatedly refused to
    help him and declined to buy his studies, said the other day
    that they were &ldquo;more beautiful than Diaz,&rdquo; which I
    think rather exaggerated. The poor fellow himself told me a
    year ago that he got a medal at one time in England - which he
    later sold as old silver....</p>

    <p>Another painter, Breitner, with whom I occasionally went
    sketching in the streets at first, and who was also in the
    hospital about the time I was, has been appointed drawing
    master at a secondary school, although I know he doesn't care
    for the job.</p>

    <p>Is it a good time for painters??? When I first came to this
    city I went to all the studios I could visit in order to find
    intercourse and make friends. Now I have cooled off very much
    in this respect, being of the opinion that there is a serious
    drawback to it, in that the painters pretend to be friendly,
    but are too often inclined to trip you up. That is the fatal
    thing; we ought to help and trust each other, for there are
    enough enmities in society, and we should be better off in
    general if we did not injure each other's interests. It is
    jealousy that impels many to speak ill systematically of others
    - and what is the result? Instead of forming a great whole, a
    corps of painters whose strength is unity, everyone keeps to
    himself and works all alone, and those who are at the top at
    present create, by their very jealousy, a kind of desert around
    themselves, which I think is a very unfortunate thing - for
    themselves.</p>

    <p>Sharp competition in painting and drawing is in a certain
    sense good, or at any rate justified, but the artists should
    not become personal enemies and fight each other with other
    weapons.</p>

    <p>Well, anyway, if all this is no obstacle to you, please
    think over whether you want to come and see those
    Graphics, for they are splendid. I want to discuss with
    you what to do with the duplicates, because there are many of
    them; these are among the <i>most beautiful</i> ones -
    &ldquo;The Last Muster,&rdquo; an old women's almshouse, by
    Herkomer, &ldquo;Low Lodginghouse St. Giles&rdquo; by the same,
    &ldquo;Emigrants&rdquo; and &ldquo;Boarding School&rdquo; by
    Frank Hol, &ldquo;Caxton <sup>4</sup> Printing&rdquo; and the
    &ldquo;Small Old Gate&rdquo; by Fred. Walker. Well, there are
    quite a lot, and such important ones that they would form the
    core of any collection of wood engravings. I know well enough
    from our previous correspondence that you won't have them for
    nothing, although if you appreciate them and would really like
    to have them, I for my part would gladly give them to you
    unconditionally.</p>

    <p>But I feel sure that we shall be able to arrange things so
    that you'll feel no pangs of conscience about accepting them,
    and as it is certain that we shall come to some agreement, I
    think the best thing would be to get together soon, if your
    health keeps on improving.</p>

    <p>And I think it all the more desirable to have you come here,
    because I have just got together a large number of drawings I
    did this winter, and I should like to talk them over with you.
    I would have written you sooner about all the things I am
    telling you now, but they seemed so strange even to myself, and
    some unpleasant experiences with others had made me angry
    besides. And I am writing you now, not because I consider you
    narrow-minded with regard to the facts of life, nor because I
    believe you will think what I have done incomprehensible, but
    because I should think it unstraightforward if I asked you to
    come and look at my wood engravings again without telling you
    that there have been rather great changes in my household, and
    that because of these changes many are avoiding me, and would
    most certainly not set foot in my house.</p>

    <p>The studio is much more spacious than the last one, but I am
    continually afraid that the landlord will raise the rent or
    find tenants who can pay more than I. Well, as long as I can
    keep it, it is a very good studio.</p>

    <p>If you consider that I now have duplicates of nearly
    everything in the Graphic<i>,</i> you'll realize that's quite a
    lot. And I hope to be able to get sets of the very first years
    too.</p>

    <p>Oh, I have had my illusions of other women as well as my
    disappointments, but I never thought it would turn out like
    this. But as for this woman, I thought it so touching that she,
    a mother, was so alone and forlorn, that I did not hesitate and
    I think I did nothing wrong then, nor do I think I am doing so
    now. For when a mother has been deserted, and is in dire
    distress, one should not avert one's eyes and go on - at least
    that's what I think. This one is a figure like some that Hol or
    Fildes have drawn.</p>

    <p>If you should come before long, don't let your visit be a
    short one. The Graphics are so beautiful that I believe looking
    them over may stimulate and invigorate you even though you are
    still weak - unless the trip itself should be too fatiguing for
    you (I live quite close to the Rhine Railway Station, for that
    matter).</p>

    <p>So do as you think best. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
