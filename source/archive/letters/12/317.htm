  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>This morning I was at Van der Weele's and saw the studies he
    had brought from Gelderland. And my longing to go to Drenthe
    was not lessened by what I heard from him. As luck would have
    it, he knew of one of the villages I had in mind - the
    landscape there is beautiful and full of character.</p>

    <p>I told him again that I was sorry I had not learned more
    about painting this year.</p>

    <p>His answer was, &ldquo;Oh, don't bother about that: in the
    first place, everybody has his own weak points - if he learns
    from somebody else, he often acquires his master's faults in
    addition to his own; go your own way quietly, without worrying
    about that.&rdquo; Well, at heart I think exactly the same,
    except that I should think myself too conceited if I was not
    always ready to learn something from others. But it may be
    considered a piece of good luck if one can hear or learn
    something from somebody else this way.</p>

    <p>You will get a small proof of how infirm the woman's
    character is when I tell you that notwithstanding her recent
    positive promise not to go to see her mother again, she has
    been there after all. I told her that if she could not keep
    such a promise for even three days, how could she expect me to
    think her capable of keeping a promise of faith forever.</p>

    <p>For I think this very mean of her, and must also suppose
    that she belongs more to those people than to me. Then she says
    that she is very sorry again, but - tomorrow she will do it
    again, that's what I am beginning to think, but she says -
    &ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo; In this sense I am almost sorry that I
    take things seriously. When I made her promise, I said to her,
    &ldquo;It is a kind of prostitution when you go there for three
    reasons: first, because you used to live with your mother, and
    she herself encouraged you to walk the street; second, because
    she lives in a slum, which you, more than anyone else, have
    reason to avoid; and finally, your brother's mistress lives in
    the same house.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She is worrying about many things, this I know; now and then
    she worries so much that one feels compassion for her - except
    that she might have trusted me completely - a long time ago, or
    rather from the very beginning - and she hasn't, although I
    told her she could from the first, and showed it, too. She
    preferred to listen to and believe people who told her that I
    should desert her, which - if it should come to that in the end
    - would be her family's fault, because she takes their view of
    things, at least more their fault than hers, for the family
    never stopped upsetting her with this talk.</p>

    <p>However, it isn't absolutely impossible that when, for
    instance, she has been living in the country for some time,
    away from all that family, she will stay straight; but who can
    assure me that out there she won't say, &ldquo;What a miserable
    hole, why did you bring me here?&rdquo; She makes me afraid of
    such things, even when I try my utmost to avoid the extremity
    of leaving her.</p>

    <p>What Zola says seems to me to be true: &ldquo;Pourtant ces
    femmes-l&agrave; ne sont point mauvaises, leurs erreurs et
    leurs ch&ucirc;tes ayant pour cause l'impossibilit&eacute;
    d'une vie droite, dans les comm&eacute;rages, les
    m&eacute;disances des faubourgs corrompus.&rdquo; You know what
    I mean, from L'Assommoir.</p>

    <p>I know there is difference too, but there are also
    similarities between my attitude toward her and that passage in
    L'Assommoir where the blacksmith sees how Gervaise goes wrong
    but hasn't the slightest influence on her; because of her
    hypocrisy and her inability to see things clearly, she cannot
    make up her mind what course to choose.</p>

    <p>I pity the woman more than ever, because I see she is more
    restless than ever. I think she has, for the moment, no better
    friend than me, who would help her with all my heart if she
    would let me. But she does not seek my confidence, and makes me
    absolutely powerless by trusting those who are really her
    enemies. I am amazed that she doesn't see that she acts wrongly
    - or doesn't want to see it, for that's what sometimes I think.
    The period when her faults made me angry is over, I went
    through it last year. <i>Now</i> when I see her falling into
    the same errors, I'm no longer astonished, and if I knew it
    would save her, I think I would put up with them. Because my
    opinion of her is such that &ldquo;quand bien m&ecirc;me&rdquo;
    I do not think her bad, she has never seen what is
    <i>good,</i> <i>how can</i> she be good.</p>

    <p>I mean she is not responsible, like somebody who understands
    the distinction between good and evil. That understanding only
    comes to her very vaguely and confusedly through intuition. I
    think if she knew what was right, she'd do it.</p>

    <p>What you said - that you believe it would do her good to
    leave me - is a thing which I myself would think probable if
    she didn't go back to her people - in the first place - and
    secondly, if she didn't have to leave the only thing that keeps
    her relatively straight - her children. It is a case which I
    see no solution for. I don't know whether you understand my
    explanation, but it's like this - &ldquo;au fond&rdquo; she
    wants to stay with me and is attached to me, but she does not
    see how she estranges herself from me, and when I say something
    about it, she answers, &ldquo;Yes, I know it quite well, you
    don't want me to stay with you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, that's in her <i>good</i> moods, and the <i>bad</i>
    ones are even more exasperating. Then she says openly,
    &ldquo;Yes, I am careless and lazy, and I have always been that
    way, and it can't be helped,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Yes, it's true
    I'm a whore, and the only end for me will be to drown
    myself.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When I think of that neglected character of hers, half or
    rather entirely spoiled - one might almost call it dragged
    through the gutter - then I say to myself: &ldquo;After all she
    cannot be different than she is,&rdquo; and I should think
    myself stupid and conceited if I condemned her in big solemn
    words. Perhaps you will better understand now than before, how
    I came to apply to her what Father Bienvenue in Victor Hugo's
    Mis&eacute;rables used to say to ugly, even venomous insects,
    &ldquo;Pauvre b&ecirc;te, ce n'est pas sa faute qu'elle est
    ainsi&rdquo; [Poor beast, it isn't its fault that it is like
    that], and you will understand that I am so anxious to save her
    that if, for instance, I could do so by marrying her, I would
    marry her even now. But would it save her? If once in Drenthe
    she kept nagging, &ldquo;Why did you bring me here?&rdquo; we
    should not have advanced much.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to explain such a matter fully, any more
    than it is possible to understand it fully. But this much you
    will understand. She is an intensely unhappy creature, and
    because of her erratic temperament, little fitted for regular
    employment, whatever it may be. And for that matter, in Leyden
    they said she should not be <i>allowed</i> to do heavy work.
    And moreover, there is the fact that nursing the baby has been
    very exhausting because of the weakness of her constitution,
    which, as I see it, is another reason for putting up with a
    great deal of laxity on her part.</p>

    <p>I am keeping this letter back for a few days. In the
    meantime father sent me a letter. My intention in writing
    Father the letter which you read at home was first to let
    Father know, and you too, that the reason I do not write much
    to the people at home is that it is the simplest thing to do as
    long as there are motives for avoiding mentioning things. But
    seeing that there was the question of my not being confiding
    enough, I wanted to show them that is not my intention to hide
    my motives, but to let people understand for themselves that it
    was better to be silent about many things. I doubt whether
    Father has inferred <i>this</i> from my letter. Well, never
    mind. He assumed it to be more of a complaint on my part, or a
    request for advice, which the letter certainly was not; it was
    simply intended to explain my motives in acting as I did, so
    that no doubt of my frankness could remain.</p>

    <p>The thing I hope you will not object to, under the
    circumstances given - is the necessity of going on, and, after
    mature consideration, my intention of staying with her if she
    herself does not make it absolutely impossible - I repeat, the
    thing I hope you will not object to, is my immediate carrying
    out the plan of going to Drenthe. Whether the woman goes with
    me or not depends on herself - I <i>know</i> she is
    deliberating with her mother. I do not know <i>what</i>. I do
    not ask, either.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.guilt">But if she wants to come with me, do let her. Leaving her
    would mean driving her back to prostitution - how could this be
    done by the same hand that tried to save her?</label></p>

    <p>For my <i>work</i> and as an <i>economy</i> measure, Drenthe
    is the best thing we can do, in my opinion, and I think you
    will see it in the same way. So leaving her out of the question
    for the moment, we shall execute that plan if you approve of
    it. At the time of departure I shall say to the woman,
    &ldquo;Will you come or stay?&rdquo; <i>If</i> she comes with
    me, I think I shall have more influence on her there, and make
    her behave better.</p>

    <p><label content="business.sales">Today I sent a number of studies to C. M.</label></p>

    <p>I am very glad about your revised opinion about my work -
    your revised opinion tallies with Rappard's - Van der Weele
    also thinks there is something in my work. Personally, I
    believe that in every painter's life there is a period when he
    makes absurdities, and for myself, I think that period is
    already a long time behind me. Further, I think that I am
    making progress slowly but steadily, and that the better work I
    do later will cast a reflex on the work I am doing now, and
    will show more clearly that even now there is already some
    truth and simplicity in it, and as you yourself express it, a
    manly conception and perception.</p>

    <p>So that if you now find something in a study, you will not
    have to retract that opinion, and later better work will never
    make you indifferent to the first.</p>

    <p>Last year Weissenbruch already said something like that to
    me - go your own way quietly, and in your old age, you will
    look back on your first studies with satisfaction.</p>

    <p>The main thing now is to paint a great deal. That, and again
    saturating myself in nature's serenity on the heath, will bring
    us victory in the end - do not doubt it - and progress from
    month to month.</p>

    <p>I'm very busy painting these days; I have several studies of
    the wood. Adieu, and write soon.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>It will be the same with the painted studies as it is with
    the drawings. Later, when I shall have made more progress,
    people will see that a certain figure, a certain bit of
    scenery, already bears a personal character.</p>

    <p>Well, if things go well, I hope to send you some studies
    from Drenthe this autumn.</p>
