  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><?showImage("319_V-T_2720");?>
     It is just getting dark, and for curiosity's sake I am sending
    you today's drawing, because I wrote you about it. This morning
    I began <art id=1020b>a watercolour</art> of a boy and a girl in
    such a soup kitchen, with another figure of a woman in a corner.
    That watercolour became too blurred, which was partly
    because the paper was not suitable.</p>

    <p>But I saw how infinitely better the studio is now for
    colour, and of course I will not stop at this first experiment.
    So the morning passed, and I spent the afternoon making a
    drawing with crayon, the one piece that was left from this
    summer. I am sending you the drawing by the same mail. I don't
    think it finished enough, but as a &ldquo;sketch from
    life&rdquo; there is perhaps some life in it, and some human
    sentiment. By and by better things will follow.</p>

    <p>This drawing still leaves the question of watercolours
    undecided, but gives a provisional answer to what you wrote
    about the little sketch I sent you to give you an idea of the
    effect of the windows in the studio.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Will you do me a <i>very great</i> favour - send me a few
    pieces of that crayon by mail?</p>

    <p>There is a soul and life in that crayon - I think
    cont&eacute; pencil is dead. Two violins may look the same on
    the outside, but in playing them, one sometimes finds a
    beautiful tone in one, and not in the other.</p>

    <p>Now that crayon has a great deal of tone or depth. I could
    almost say, That crayon knows what I want, it listens with
    intelligence and obeys; the cont&eacute; pencil is indifferent
    and unwilling.</p>

    <p>The crayon has a real gypsy soul; if it isn't asking too
    much of you, send me some of it.</label></p>

    <p>Who knows, if now, with the better light, and the crayon,
    and the lithographic crayon, I shan't succeed in making
    something for illustrated papers. <i>Current events</i> - that
    was what they asked for - if they mean such things as, for
    instance, illuminations for the king's birthday, I should care
    very little for it - but if their lordships the managers would
    consent to rank scenes from the daily life of the people under
    current events, I should gladly try my best to make them.</p>

    <p>When I have some more of that crayon, I shall make a few
    more figures of almshouse men.</p>

    <p>And from those soup kitchens, of which this is the first,
    <art id=1020a>you will get </art>some quite different compositions.</p>

    <p>You will perhaps find this size a little too large, but I
    think after having worked some time, always with models, I
    shall succeed in making the figures so vigorous that their
    being large won't matter, and it will be even better that way.
    It need not prevent my making smaller ones, and I can always
    reduce the size. There is much that I don't like in this rough
    sketch, but I know for sure that in a short time I shall make
    progress.</p>

    <p>When you see this group of people together, can you
    understand that I feel at home with them?</p>

    <p>Some time ago I read the following words in Eliot's Felix
    Holt the Radical:</p>

    <p>The people I live among have the same follies and vices as
    the rich, only they <i>have their own forms</i> of folly and
    vice - and they have not what are called the refinements of the
    rich to make their faults more bearable.</p>

    <p>It doesn't much matter to me - I am not fond of those
    refinements, but some people are, and find it difficult to feel
    at home with such persons as have them not.</p>

    <p>I shouldn't have thought of it in these terms, but I have
    felt the same sometimes. As a painter I not only feel perfectly
    at home and contented with them, but I find in them a quality
    that sometimes reminds me of gypsies, at least of something as
    picturesque.</p>

    <p>As I have written so often lately, I probably won't write
    again before the tenth; don't send me the money later if you
    can help it, for I promised Leurs I should pay something off
    about that time; I must do that before I can get some new
    things which I shall need. <label content="art.support">For
    instance, I intend to buy, at what they call wholesale price,
    several things which he has had
    for a long time, and will let me have cheaply. Especially a
    number of sheets of a rough kind of watercolour paper which is
    no longer in demand, but which I like better than the smooth
    kind. </label>You would do me a great favour by sending that
    crayon.</p>

    <p>Adieu, my very best wishes, especially for your patient.
    Believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
