  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Your letter and the enclosure were not a little welcome; the
    news that you are going to write a little more at length was no
    less welcome. I hope you will write me in detail about Les Cent
    Chefs-d'Oeuvre [The Hundred Masterpieces] - it must have been a
    good thing to have seen such a show.</p>

    <p>And when one thinks how at the time there were a few persons
    whose character, intention and genius were rather suspect in
    the public's opinion - persons about whom the most absurd
    things were told, Millet, Corot, Daubigny, etc., who were
    thought of the way the village policeman views a stray shaggy
    dog, or a tramp without a passport - and time passes, and
    voil&agrave; &ldquo;les cent chefs-d'oeuvre,&rdquo; and if a
    hundred are not enough, then innumerable ones. And what becomes
    of the policeman? Very little remains of <i>them</i> except a
    number of summonses as curiosities. Yet I think the history of
    great men is tragic - though it's true that they did not meet
    only village policemen in their lives - for usually they are no
    longer alive when their work is publically acknowledged, and
    for a long time during their lives they are under a kind of
    depression because of the opposition and the difficulties of
    struggling through life. And so whenever I hear of such a
    public acknowledgement of the merits of such and such a one, I
    think the more vividly of the quiet, somewhat sombre figures of
    those who personally had few friends, and then, in their
    simplicity, I find them <i>even</i> greater and more
    tragic.</p>

    <p>There is an etching by Legros, Carlyle in his study, which I
    often have in mind when I want to think of Millet, for
    instance, as he really was. Something like what Victor Hugo
    says about Aeschylus, &ldquo;On tua l'homme puis on dit:
    &eacute;l&eacute;vons pour Aischylos une statue en bronze [They
    killed the man, then they said: Let us erect a bronze statue
    for Aeschylus], always comes to my mind when I hear of an
    exhibition of somebody's works. I care very little for
    &ldquo;la statue de bronze,&rdquo; not because I do not approve
    of public appreciation, but because of the thoughts about the
    man which accompany it: Aeschylus was simply banished, but here
    too the banishment was a death sentence, as it often is.</p>

    <p>Theo, when you come to the studio someday, I shall be able
    to show you a collection which you certainly won't find
    everywhere. I can show you something which might be called the
    &ldquo;Hundred Masterpieces&rdquo; in wood engraving by modern
    artists. The work of men whose names are unknown even to most
    connoisseurs.</p>

    <p>Who knows Buckmann, who knows the two Greens, who knows
    R&eacute;gamey's drawings? Only a very few.</p>

    <p>Seen together, one wonders at that firmness of drawing, that
    personal character, that serious conception and that
    penetration and artistic elevation of the most ordinary figures
    and subjects found in the streets, in the market place, in a
    hospital or an almshouse.</p>

    <p>Last year I had already collected something, but what I have
    found since has far surpassed my expectations.</p>

    <p>When you come, you won't pay too short a visit to the
    studio, will you? Since I wrote you, I have worked on <art id=1034>those
    potato diggers</art>. And I started a second one on the same subject,
    with the single figure of an old man.</p>

    <p>Further, I am doing <art id=1035>a sower in a large field, with lumps of
    earth, which I think is better than the other sowers I tried
    before</art>.</p>

    <p>I have at least six more of them, solely as studies of the
    figure, but now I have put him into surroundings more
    especially like a real composition, and I have carefully
    studied the earth and sky besides. Then I have studies of <art id=1035a>the
    burning of weeds</art>, and of a man with a sack of
    potatoes on his back, and one with a wheelbarrow.</p>

    <p>I think of Tersteeg's opinion that I must make watercolours;
    supposing I myself were wrong, and tried with all good will to
    change my mind, yet I cannot understand how these figures of
    the man with the sack, of the sower, of the old potato digger,
    of the wheelbarrow, of the man burning weeds, would retain
    their individuality if I made them in watercolour. The result
    would be very mediocre, the kind of mediocrity which I don't
    want to surrender myself to. Now there is at all events some
    character in them, something which - be it from afar - is in
    harmony with what Lhermitte, for instance, seeks.</p>

    <p>Watercolour is not the most sympathetic means for him who
    particularly wants to express the boldness, the vigour, and the
    robustness of the figures. It is different when one seeks tone
    or colour exclusively, then watercolour is excellent. Now I
    must admit that one could make different studies of those same
    figures done from another point of view (namely tone and
    colour) and with another intention - but the question is, if my
    temperament and personal feeling primarily draw me toward the
    character, the structure, the action of the figures, can one
    blame me if, following this emotion, I don't express myself in
    watercolour, but in a drawing with only black or brown?</p>

    <p>But there are watercolours where the outlines are very
    strongly expressed - for instance those by R&eacute;gamey,
    those by Pinwell and Walker and Herkomer, which I think of very
    often (those by the Belgian Meunier); but even if I tried this,
    Tersteeg would not be satisfied with them. He would always say,
    &ldquo;It is not saleable and saleability must come first
    now.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Personally I think he means in plainer terms, &ldquo;You are
    a mediocrity and you are arrogant because you don't give in and
    you make mediocre little things: you are making yourself
    ridiculous with your so-called seeking, and you do not
    work.&rdquo; That is the real meaning of what Tersteeg said to
    me the year before last, and last year; and he still means
    it.</p>

    <p>I am afraid Tersteeg will always be for me &ldquo;the
    everlasting no.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>That is what not only I, but almost everyone who seeks his
    own way, has behind or beside him as an everlasting
    discourager. Sometimes one is depressed by it and feels
    miserable and almost stunned.</p>

    <p>But I repeat, it is the everlasting no; in the cases of men
    of character, on the contrary, one finds an everlasting
    <i>yes</i>, and discovers in them &ldquo;la foi du
    charbonnier.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But for all that, life sometimes becomes gloomy, and the
    future, dark, because the work costs money, so the harder one
    works, the deeper one gets into debt, instead of the work
    helping one on, so that difficulties and expense may be
    surmounted by working harder.</p>

    <p>I make progress with my figures, but financially I am losing
    ground, and cannot keep it up.</p>

    <p>And of late I sometimes think it would be well to move to
    the country, either to the seaside or to a spot where the farm
    labour is full of character, because I think it would help me
    to economize.</p>

    <p>Here I could also do what I want if I could earn a little
    more and go here and there to make studies. And the advantage
    here is that my studio is good, and that after all one is not
    quite outside the world of art; one can hardly do without some
    intercourse, without hearing and seeing something now and
    then.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I sometimes think of going to England. In London they
    publish a new magazine of importance, equal to the London News
    and Graphic <i>-</i> the Pictorial News. Perhaps I could find
    work and wages there, but who can give any security?</label></p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">Recently I have not asked for particulars about the woman,
    as I myself feel assured that you love each other, which is the
    main thing, for as long as one knows this one thing, there is
    no need to ask for particulars.</label></p>

    <p>I only hope you will come soon - a year is a long time not
    to see each other, yet to be always thinking of each other. Now
    on July 1 our little chap was one year old, and he is the
    merriest, jolliest child you can imagine, and I think this
    child's doing well and keeping her busy and occupying her
    thoughts are impor-tant in saving the woman herself. For the
    rest, I sometimes think it would be well for her to live in the
    country for a time, far from the city and far from the family;
    it would help to bring about a thorough improvement. It's true
    she has improved, but her family's influence is a bad drawback
    at times: I want to lead her to greater simplicity, whereas
    they are driving her to intrigues and duplicity.</p>

    <p>Well, she is indeed what one may call an &ldquo;enfant du
    si&egrave;cle,&rdquo; and her character has been so much
    influenced by circumstances that she will always show the
    consequences in the form of a certain discouragement and
    indifference, and want of a firm faith in something or other.
    Often, often I have thought it would be good for her to live in
    the country. But moving also brings a lot of expenses. And then
    I should want to be married before I moved if I went either to
    the country or to London.</p>

    <p>I do miss the necessary intercourse with other people here,
    and I don't see any chance of improving this. After all, every
    place is alike to me, and I want to move as little as
    possible.</p>

    <p>As soon as you have decided anything about your coming - do
    write me. I am in doubt about several things of late, and it
    makes me rather nervous and that will remain so till we have
    seen each other and spoken about the future.</p>

    <p>Recently I have read articles by Boughton on Holland. They
    were the text accompanying illustrations by himself and Abbey,
    splendid things some of them. One thing I noted especially - a
    description of the isle of Marken - written in such a manner
    that I should like to go there, and who knows what a good thing
    it might prove to be if one settled someplace which was very
    picturesque.</p>

    <p>But in such a case one must have at least one point of
    contact with the art world, for of course the fishing
    population hasn't the slightest notion of it, and one must have
    enough to live on.</p>

    <p>Don't forget to write the promised letter about Les Cent
    Chefs-d'Oeuvre, and if you are very lucky in business, and
    could send me something extra, it would be very welcome.</p>

    <p>As to living in the country - I love nature, yet there are
    many things that tie me to the city, especially the magazines,
    the possibility of reproduction.</p>

    <p>Not to see any locomotives would mean no hardship for me,
    but never to see a printing press would be hard. Adieu, boy,
    with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I have been reading Mes Haines by Zola; there are good
    things in it, though I think he makes great mistakes - he
    doesn't even mention Millet in his general survey. The
    following is quite true: &ldquo;Observez que ce qui pla&icirc;t
    au <i>public</i> est toujours ce qu'il y a de plus banal, ce
    qu'on a costume de voir chaque ann&eacute;e, on est
    habitu&eacute; &agrave; de telles fadeurs, &agrave; des
    mensonges si jolis, qu'on refuse de toute sa puissance les
    v&eacute;rit&eacute;s fortes.&rdquo; [Note that what pleases
    the <i>public</i> is always utterly banal, just what they are
    accustomed to seeing every year; they have got used to such
    insipidities, to such pretty lies that they repudiate vigorous
    truths with all their might.]</p>
