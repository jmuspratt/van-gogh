  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>The Graphics are now in my possession. I have been looking
    them over until far into the night.</p>

    <p>I don't know whether you are acquainted with the volumes for
    '70-'75 - perhaps you have them yourself among the lot you
    bought. But if not, I know you will be delighted with the first
    years, whenever you find an opportunity to look at them.</p>

    <p>I hope with all my heart that you have them among your lot;
    if not, I shall write about them at greater length, in
    anticipation of your being able to see them yourself, as there
    are so many important things among them. And at any rate you
    must try your utmost to add them to your collection.</p>

    <p>For instance, there is a series of drawings of the coal
    mines by Ridley - done in a way that makes one think of the
    etchings of Whistler or Seymour Haden. There are similar
    drawings by Boyd Houghton, mostly about America.</p>

    <p>Until now I never knew Boyd H[oughton] was <i>so</i>
    interesting. There are also sketches of his from the time of
    the &ldquo;Commune&rdquo;: p&eacute;troleuses, a barricade,
    etc.</p>

    <p>Herkomer is superb - I have now seen quite a number of large
    sheets for the first time: &ldquo;Old Women's Almshouse,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Old Men's Almshouse,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Cobbler,&rdquo; a
    &ldquo;Kegelbahn&rdquo; [Skittle Alley], &ldquo;Orphan
    Men,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lodginghouse,&rdquo; etc.</p>

    <p>There are also Pinwells and Fred. Walkers in those first
    volumes. Also Ch. Green, Buckmann, Brentall, Small, H. Woods,
    Macbeth, Gregory, all kinds of sketches of the slum districts,
    etc., Frank Hol's &ldquo;The Foundling&rdquo; - superb</p>

    <p>By the same, &ldquo;I am the Resurrection and the
    life&rdquo; - superb.</p>

    <p>By the same, &ldquo;Railway Station.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo; &ldquo;Sightseeing.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>These are three sheets I have not seen for ten years.</p>

    <p>Once again I must mention Boyd Houghton - a Shaker or Mormon
    church, incredibly full of character.</p>

    <p>Also large du Mauriers, sunny, and clear in the shadows.</p>

    <p>Enough. You will understand that there are treasures among
    them.</p>

    <p>I am very eager to get further information about your find.
    If you have the London News of the period '70-'75, I should
    very much like to know the most important things in them. I
    shall certainly get duplicates in consequence of my new
    purchase.</p>

    <p>I am at a loss what to do. These Graphic series are neatly
    bound and in very good condition. It is almost a pity to pull
    them apart. But on the other hand, being able to arrange the
    sheets in such a way that the work of each artist is assembled
    is also important.</p>

    <p>Listen, old fellow - if you have these old volumes of the
    Graphic among your lot, you know all about them. But if you
    haven't, then you will get one of the strongest impressions
    when you come here to see them.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">While I was looking them over, all my memories of London ten
    years ago came back to me - when I saw them for the first time;
    they moved me so deeply that I have been thinking about them
    ever since,</label> for instance Hol's &ldquo;The Foundling&rdquo; and
    Herkomer's &ldquo;Old Women&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

    <p>But I had a melancholy feeling at the same time when I saw
    H. Herkomer's words, which you passed on to me some time ago,
    so clearly confirmed - namely that the later issues of the
    Graphic<i>,</i> however beautiful occasionally, have fallen off
    very, very much in general.</p>

    <p>But those first ones!</p>

    <p>One of the volumes of `70 is missing, but otherwise the
    whole set `70 - `80 is complete, 21 volumes in all.</p>

    <p>But I think I shall find the first volume too.</p>

    <p>How are you getting on? Please write either a long or a
    short letter soon.</p>

    <p>And if you should still be feeling weak, and would care to
    have some volumes of those first years with you, I could send
    them to you.</p>

    <p>There is something stimulating and invigorating like old
    wine about those striking, powerful, virile drawings.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
