  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter, which I received this morning. I'm
    glad to see that you took all that I told you in such a
    good-natured way. Later when I find an opportunity to tell you
    more particulars to explain the circumstances more clearly, I
    hope you will not have to change your opinion that I have acted
    honestly and in good faith. I have to do with a woman who had
    one foot in the grave when I met her, and whose mind and
    nervous system were also upset and unbalanced - whose only
    chance of staying alive was what that professor at Leyden had
    prescribed: a regular home life. And even then it will take
    years before she is <i>entirely</i> normal again.</p>

    <p>As to her past life, I believe that you condemn
    &ldquo;fallen women&rdquo; no more than I do. Frank Hol once
    expressed it this way - in a drawing which as far as I know has
    not yet been reproduced - he called the drawing &ldquo;Her
    Poverty but Not Her Will Consents.&rdquo; Amice, at this very
    moment I can think of no fewer than four women in this town
    (mine included) who have either fallen, or have been deceived
    and deserted, and have illegitimate children, and their fate is
    so melancholy that it is difficult to think of, especially as
    three of them have hardly a chance of getting out of their
    misery - that is, in theory they do, but not in practice, as I
    see it. And I feel obliged to add that I do not consider my
    relation with the woman in question as something of a passing
    nature.</p>

    <p>My words about a past disappointment are based on something
    I won't speak about - at least not now. And yet I think it
    right to tell you this much. Suppose a man experiences a
    disappointment through a cruel injury to his love, a
    disappointment so deep that he is <i>calmly</i> desperate and
    desolate - such a condition is possible, for there is something
    like the <i>white</i> heat of steel or iron. Feeling that he
    has been disappointed irrevocably and absolutely, and carrying
    within himself the consciousness of it as a deadly, at least an
    incurable, wound, and yet going about his ordinary affairs with
    an unruffled countenance... would it be inexplicable to you
    that a man in this condition should feel a singular sympathy,
    involuntary and unintentional, for somebody he meets who is
    deeply unhappy, oh, perhaps unhappy beyond redress? And that,
    notwithstanding this, that sympathy or love or tie should be
    and remain strong? When <i>Love</i> is dead, is it impossible
    for <i>Charity</i> to be alive and awake still?</p>

    <p>And now allow me to start talking about the wood engravings.
    Thc daily work is something that does not change, and it is
    less dangerous to be absorbed in it than to stare into the
    unfathomable.</p>

    <p>I have found another beautiful Jacque,
    &ldquo;Woodcutters&rdquo; - unfortunately covered with colours
    from a child's paintbox - but I have washed most of it off. It
    is a very lovely sheet.</p>

    <p>Two Daumiers: &ldquo;Those who have seen a drama meeting
    those who have seen a vaudeville&rdquo; - &ldquo;Lovers of
    Pictures.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Two females (one with a child), sitting and chatting, by
    Oberl&auml;nder, and by the same, two old men who seem to be
    discussing abstruse official business. Both of them uncommonly
    typical.</p>

    <p>Fine Edmond Morins, especially the &ldquo;Chestnut Trees in
    the Champs Elys&eacute;es,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Race&rdquo; and a
    &ldquo;Wine Harvest.&rdquo; John Lewis Brown's &ldquo;Hunters
    in the Wood.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fall of the Leaf&rdquo; by G.
    Dor&eacute; - a very old Dor&eacute;, roughly done but
    excellent in sentiment. &ldquo;Gypsies&rdquo; by Valerio;
    Renouard's &ldquo;Beggars on New Year's Day.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>These are some of the new sheets I have.</p>

    <p>I am glad you have taken Harper's Christmas Papers; perhaps
    this publication is also <i>too good to last</i>. How beautiful
    Abbey's &ldquo;Winter Girl&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dutch
    Patrol&rdquo; are.</p>

    <p>Judging from these, you can imagine how excellent his big
    sheet &ldquo;Christmas in Old Virginia&rdquo; is. Swain has
    engraved it in such a way that it has remained exactly like the
    pen-and-ink drawing - &ldquo;<i>it does not look cut at
    all&rdquo;</i><sup>1</sup> - as little as Caldecott's
    &ldquo;Brighton Promenade,&rdquo; which I think you have.</p>

    <p>I know Harper's magazine from some old issues in my
    possession; I am considering subscribing for this year, but
    perhaps there will be a chance of getting it secondhand by the
    end of the year.</p>

    <p>Do you know that I am carrying on a correspondence just at
    present about the way such sheets - those in the Christmas
    Papers, for instance - are done? <label content="art.support">I have samples of the paper
    and also some information about the varying forces of Black and
    White and the way they can be produced. The paper is very
    curious; sometimes the grain has a sort of ground colour, which
    is already like a grey haze - it is especially suitable, for
    snow effects, for instance. There is also paper with
    hatchings.</label></p>

    <p>I am still keeping a beautiful sheet by Dagnan for you,
    &ldquo;Jardin des Tuileries,&rdquo; and one by Montbard,
    &ldquo;Arab Beggars,&rdquo; and certainly some smaller ones
    besides the duplicates from the <i>Graphic.</i></p>

    <p>Before your illness you wrote me that you had a duplicate of
    Heilbuth's &ldquo;Two Ladies in a Boat.&rdquo; This is the one
    that is missing from my collection, although I have other large
    Heilbuths, so I wish to remind you of it.</p>

    <p>I don't remember whether I wrote you about the Caldecott
    illustrations for Washington Irving's Sketch Book - &ldquo;Old
    Christmas&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bracebridge Hall.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Two sixpenny books, published by Macmillan &amp; Co., London
    - in each of them a hundred little drawings by Caldecott, but
    sometimes they are so beautiful that they remind you of
    Menzel.</p>

    <p>I should like to know sometime what the theme of De Groux's
    &ldquo;Winter in Brussels&rdquo; is.</p>

    <p>Have I written you about Lhermitte? He seems to be the
    Master of Black and White drawing; they say of him, &ldquo;He
    is the Millet and Jules Breton of Black and White.&rdquo; In a
    &ldquo;general survey&rdquo; there is mention, among other
    things, of women saying their prayers on the Brittany cliffs, a
    &ldquo;Banc des Pauvres,&rdquo; and an &ldquo;Old
    Market.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Although in consequence of having taken the woman and her
    two children into my house I have had some unpleasant
    experiences - some of them very nasty indeed - still the
    encounter has given me a certain calm and serenity. And I
    worked hard this winter. I had some very striking models.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">At the moment I am not working so very hard, for after
    working - especially on heads - for some months practically
    without rest or interruption, I have been feeling a kind of
    weakness or exhaustion which I find I can't overcome.</label> <label content="health.eyes">The same
    thing happened to my eyes, so that even simply looking at
    things bothered me. But I have walked a good deal in the
    country these last days, and my eyes are normal again.</label>
    <sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>I think I have at least 150 drawings that you have not seen
    yet.</p>

    <p>The changes in my household, instead of causing me to work
    less, have caused me to work more; I worked even with a sort of
    fury, but a quiet fury, if you will allow me to use the
    expression. I also started reading again, which I had neglected
    for some time.</p>

    <p>I think you will be delighted with the baby - those who
    abandon a woman when she is pregnant know not what they do -
    such a baby can be said to bring a rayon d'en haut - a ray from
    heaven - into the house. As for the woman herself, do you
    remember what Gavarni said? - &ldquo;Il y a une creature,
    insupportable, b&ecirc;te, m&eacute;chante, c'est la jeune
    fille; il y a une creature sublime et d&eacute;vou&eacute;e
    c'est cette fille devenue m&egrave;re.&rdquo; [A young girl is
    an unbearable, stupid, vicious creature: a sublime and devoted
    creature is that same girl as a mother.] I don't think these
    words are meant to stigmatize all young women or girls
    absolutely - of course not - but they are meant to show that
    something vain in a woman before she has become a mother is
    replaced by something sublime later on, when she is working
    hard for her children.</p>

    <p>I saw a little figure by Paterson in the Graphic<i>,</i> an
    illustration for Hugo's Quatre-vingt-treize<sup>3</sup> called
    &ldquo;Dolorosa.&rdquo; It struck me because it resembles the woman
    at the time I found her. In the same book there is a scene of a
    proud, hard-hearted man who is suddenly softened by seeing two
    children in danger - he forgets his own danger and saves the
    children, even though he is selfish by nature. One never finds
    an exact likeness of oneself in a book - but one occasionally
    finds things taken from nature in general which are in one's
    own heart in a vague and indeterminate way.</p>

    <p>I find much that is true in Dickens's The Haunted Man. Do
    you know it? Neither in Quatre-vingt-treize nor in The Haunted
    Man do I find my own self - everything is different,
    occasionally even quite the opposite - but much that has gone
    on in my mind is reawakened when I read such books.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
