  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I just received the roll of wood engravings. My hearty
    thanks for them. They are beautiful, all of them - the Heilbuth
    more beautiful than any of the sheets already in my possession.
    I remember that you spoke to me at one time about their
    extraordinarily fine <i>execution</i>. Why should I
    remember? - just because I was struck by the execution, which
    is exactly what my brother described in a recent letter. When
    you come here I am going to show you what it is done <i>on</i>,
    and I expect you to be somewhat surprised, as I was myself. I
    don't doubt for a moment that you will then get to the bottom
    of how those grey, white and black effects are obtained.</p>

    <p>The sheet I am most delighted with at present is Lucas's
    &ldquo;The Light of Other Days,&rdquo; which is exactly like
    one of Andersen's fairytales. Oh, I think it so beautiful and
    characteristic. Now I happen to have a
    &ldquo;Sylvesternacht&rdquo; [New Year's Eve] - I don't know by
    whom, but it's a German - also a night watchman in front of a
    church-tower shutter in the snow, which is a companion piece,
    so to speak. And how beautifully vigorous the engraving is!</p>

    <p>Marchetti's &ldquo;Au Pesage&rdquo; [At the Weighing] has a
    lot of life - greatly resembles Small.</p>

    <p>I have two curious sheets by Gussow besides; the one with
    the two old people is good. <i>That Beautiful Wretch</i> is
    alluring. What a contrast there is in the engraving between the
    illustrations in it and, for instance, The Light of Other
    Days<i>.</i> I knew some of the little figures in it already,
    as they have been reproduced in the Univers Illustr&eacute;; if
    my memory is correct. But most of them were quite new to me,
    and some I thought splendid, e.g. the little figure in white
    against a background of wooded brown dunes or heath, and also
    &ldquo;The Stroll in the Snow&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Old Lady in
    Black by the Fireside.&rdquo; The latter is what I would call
    &ldquo;cosy&rdquo; in the highest degree.</p>

    <p>These may be only impressions - but they're fresh. It is a
    magnificent lot; once more, my hearty thanks!</p>

    <p>Have you got &ldquo;Snowballing,&rdquo; a full-page print by
    Ed. Fr&egrave;re in the London News - a school playground with
    boys? I just got a duplicate.</p>

    <p>I found an uncommonly fine sheet by Vautier at the same
    time, &ldquo;Eine Verhaftung&rdquo; [An Arrest]. I am so very
    eager to have you here - not only because from selfish motives
    I am eager for your company, but because I firmly believe that
    particularly the wood engravings in these first years of the
    Graphic will so impress you as to give you &ldquo;<i>the full
    certainty&rdquo;</i> of their importance. <i>Not</i> that I
    still believe you're not attached to them with all your heart -
    on the contrary, I no longer have any doubt about it.</p>

    <p>But all the same, there are some sheets that you probably
    don't know yet and that will make the whole even richer and
    sounder.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that when one has a sheet in one's possession
    and looks at it repeatedly, one gets to admire it more and
    more. I think you know all three Herkomers I am sending you
    today, but it is my desire that you should have them for
    yourself.</p>

    <p>And I often spoke to you, amice, about Pinwell and Walker.
    Well, here is a genuine Walker, first rate. Have I praised it
    too highly?</p>

    <p>Now you must accept these without any more ado, and also the
    other duplicates which I shall get out of the Graphics<i>.</i>
    A collection of sheets like these becomes, in my opinion, a
    kind of Bible to an artist, in which he reads from time to time
    to get in a devotional mood. I think it's not only a good thing
    to know them, but also to have them around continually in the
    studio.</p>

    <p>I don't doubt for a moment that (unless you should have them
    already), upon receiving these sheets, you'll feel at once that
    it's a good thing to have them, and that you'll never part with
    them.</p>

    <p>If you should feel some pangs of conscience about accepting
    these and other sheets, well, just think over whether you have
    ever regretted taking those first ones with you last year. I
    don't believe it; it may be because of this or something else -
    but it is a fact that you think about your collection much more
    often this year than you used to. And that's only natural; just
    having these sheets oneself causes one to think of them more
    often and impresses them clearly and strongly on one's mind.
    And so I believe that these will have the same result - they
    will become your friends more and more. Well, personally I
    don't regret having given them to you, for you appreciate them
    and look at them as they ought to be looked at. There are so
    few who have a feeling for them; and it is certainly true that
    since you have an eye and a heart for them, I have become so
    attached to your friendship that it would be hard for me to do
    without it.</p>

    <p>I used to think years ago that most artists had the same
    kinds of feelings and ideas about art as you and I, but in some
    sense this is not true at all.</p>

    <p>Well, so much for that. Trust me in this matter, and accept
    them without more ado. You will get more of them when you have
    recovered completely and come to see me.</p>

    <p>I have something more to tell you in connection with Hol's
    &ldquo;Irish Emigrants.&rdquo; The character of the woman I
    wrote you about is something like that of the principal figure
    of that sheet - I mean the mother with the baby on her arm -
    i.e. considered as a whole, without any attention to details. I
    could not give you a better description of her.</p>

    <p>Now, old fellow, get well soon, and write me a letter before
    long - have no scruples about this batch - thanks again for
    yours - a firm handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
