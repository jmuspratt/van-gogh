  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>As I look forward to your arrival, there is hardly a moment
    when my thoughts are not with you.</p>

    <p>These last days I have gone on to paint several studies, so
    that you may see them at the same time. And that change of work
    does me good, for though I cannot do literally as Weissenbruch
    does, and go and stay in the polders for a few weeks, yet I do
    do something like it, and to look at the green fields has a
    calming effect.</p>

    <p>Besides, I decidedly hope in this way to make progress in
    terms of colour. The last painted studies seem to me firmer and
    more solid in colour. So for instance <art id=1666>a few I made recently, in
    the rain</art>, showing a man on a wet, muddy road, express the
    sentiment better, I think.</p>

    <p>Well, we will see when you come.</p>

    <p>Most of them are impressions of landscape, I dare not say as
    well done as those that sometimes occur in your letters,
    because still I am often checked by technical difficulties -
    yet there is something in them, I think - for instance, a
    silhouette of the city in the evening, when the sun is setting,
    and a towpath with windmills.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">For the rest, it is miserable enough that I still feel very
    faint when I am not hard at my work, but I believe it is
    receding. I will decidedly try hard to lay up a reserve of
    strength for I shall need it to carry on the painting of the
    figure with a firm hand.</label></p>

    <p>While painting, I feel of late a certain power of colour
    awakening in me, stronger and different from what I have felt
    till now.</p>

    <p>It may be that the nervousness of these days is linked up
    with a kind of revolution in my way of working, for which I
    have been seeking and of which I have been thinking for a long
    time already.</p>

    <p>I have often tried to work less dryly, but it always turned
    into the same thing over again. But now that a kind of weakness
    prevents me from working in my usual way, this seems to help,
    rather than to hinder, <label content="art.technique">and now that I let myself go a little,
    and look more through the eyelashes, instead of concentrating
    on the joints and analysing the structure of things, it leads
    me more directly to seeing things more like adjacent
    contrasting patches of colour.</label></p>

    <p>I wonder what it will lead to, and how it will develop. I
    have sometimes wondered why I was not more of a colourist,
    because my temperament decidedly seems to indicate it - but up
    till now it developed very little.</p>

    <p>I repeat, I wonder how it will develop - but I see clearly
    that my last painted studies are different.</p>

    <p>If I remember rightly, you still have one from last year, of
    a few tree trunks in the wood.</p>

    <p>I do not think that it is really bad, but it is not what one
    sees in the studies of colourists. Some colours there are
    correct, but though they are correct they do not have the
    effect they ought to have, and though the paint is here and
    there laid on thickly, even so the effect is too meagre. I take
    this one as an example, and now I think that the last ones
    which are less thickly laid on are nonetheless becoming more
    potent in colour, as the colours are more interwoven and the
    strokes of the brush cover one another, so that it is mellower
    and more for instance like the downiness of the clouds or of
    the grass.</p>

    <p>At times I have been greatly worried that I made no progress
    with colour, but now I am hopeful again.</p>

    <p>We shall see how it will develop.</p>

    <p>Now you will understand that I am very anxious for your
    coming, for if you also sawthat there is a change, I should not
    doubt that we are on the right track. I dare not quite trust my
    own eyes as regards my own work. Those two studies, for
    instance, which I made while it was raining - a muddy road with
    a little figure - they seem to me exactly the opposite of some
    other studies. When I look at them I rediscover the sentiment
    of that dreary rainy day; and in the figure there is a kind of
    life, though it is nothing but a few patches of colour - it is
    not summoned by correctness of drawing, for there is in effect
    no drawing. What I mean to suggest is that in these studies I
    believe there is something of that mysteriousness one gets by
    looking at nature through the eyelashes, so that the outlines
    are simplified to blots of colour.</p>

    <p>Time must pass over it, but at present I see in several
    studies something different in colour and tone.</p>

    <p>Recently I often think of a story I read in an English
     magazine, a tale about a painter, in which there appears a
    person whose health suffered also in a time of trouble, and who
    went to a lonely place in the peat fields, and there in that
    melancholy setting found himself again, and began to paint
    nature as he felt and saw it. It was very well described in the
    story, evidently by a person who was well up in art, and it
    struck me when I read it, while now of late I sometimes think
    of it again.</p>

    <p>At any rate I hope we shall soon be able to talk it over and
    consult together. If you can, write soon, and of course the
    sooner you can send the money, the better it will be for
    me.</p>

    <p>With a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>For no particular reason, I cannot help adding a thought
    that often occurs to me. Not only did I start drawing
    relatively late in life, but it may well be that I shall not be
    able to count on many more years of life either.</p>

    <p>If I think about it dispassionately - as if making
    calculations for an estimate or a specification - then it is in
    the nature of things that I cannot possibly know anything
    definitely about it.</p>

    <p>But by comparison with various people with whose lives one
    may be familiar, or by comparison with some with whom one is
    supposed to have some things in common, one can draw certain
    conclusions which are not completely without foundation.</p>

    <p>So, as to the time I still have ahead of me for work, I
    think I may safely presume that my body will hold up for a
    certain number of years <i>quand bien m&ecirc;me</i> [in spite
    of everything] - a certain number between 6 and 10, say. (I can
    assume this the more safely as there is for the time being no
    immediate quand bien m&ecirc;me.)</p>

    <p>This is the period on which I count <i>firmly</i>. For the
    rest, it would be speculating far too wildly for me to dare
    make a definite pronouncements about myself, seeing that it
    depends precisely on those first, say, ten years as to whether
    or not there will be anything after that time.</p>

    <p>If one wears oneself out during these years then one won't
    live beyond 40. If one conserves enough strength to withstand
    the sort of shocks that tend to befall one, and manages to deal
    with various more or less complicated physical problems, then
    by the age of 40 to 50 one is back on a new, relatively normal
    course.</p>

    <p>But such calculations are <i>not relevant at present</i>.
    Instead, as I started to say, one should plan for a period of
    between 5 and 10 years. I do not intend to spare myself, to
    avoid emotions or difficulties - it makes comparatively little
    difference to me whether I go on living for a shorter or longer
    time - besides I am not competent to manage my constitution the
    way, say, a physician is able to. And so I go on like an
    <i>ignoramus</i>, one who knows just one thing: <i>within a few
    years I must have done a certain amount of work</i> - I don't
    need to <i>rush</i>, for there is no point in that, but I must
    <i>carry on working</i> in complete calm and serenity, as
    regularly and with as much concentration as possible, as much
    to the point as possible. The world concerns me only in so far
    as I owe it certain <i>debt</i> and <i>duty</i>, so to speak,
    because I have walked this earth for 30 years, and out of
    gratitude would like to leave some memento in the form of
    drawings and paintings - not made to please this school or
    that, but to express a genuine human feeling. So that work is
    my aim - and when one concentrates on this idea, everything one
    does is simplified, in that it is not muddled but has a single
    objective. At present the work is going slowly - one reason
    more not to lose any time.</p>

    <p>Guillaume R&eacute;gamey was, I think, someone who left
    behind no particular reputation (you know there are two
    R&eacute;gameys, F. R&eacute;gamey paints Japanese people, and
    is his brother), but is nevertheless a personality for whom I
    have a great respect. He died at the age of 38, and one period
    of his life lasting 6 or 7 years was almost exclusively devoted
    to drawings with a highly distinctive style, done while he
    worked under some physical handicap. He is one of many - a very
    good one among many good ones.</p>

    <p>I don't mention him to compare myself with him, I am not as
    good as he was, but to cite a specific example of self-control
    and willpower, sustained by one inspiring idea, which in
    difficult circumstances nevertheless showed him how to do good
    work with utter serenity.</p>

    <p>That is how I regard myself, as having to accomplish in a
    few years something full of heart and love, and to do it with a
    will. Should I live longer, tant mieux, [so much the better]
    but I put that out of my mind. <i>Something must be
    accomplished</i> in those few years<i>,</i> this thought guides
    all my plans. You will understand better now why I have a
    yearning to press on - and at the same time some determination
    to use simple means. And perhaps you will also be able to
    understand that as far as I am concerned I do not consider my
    studies in isolation but always think of my work as a
    whole.</p>
