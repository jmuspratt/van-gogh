  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Do you remember that I wrote some time ago, &ldquo;I am
    sitting in front of two large blank sheets and do not know how
    I shall get something onto them&rdquo;?</p>

    <p>Since then, you know I did the refuse dump on one, but these
    last days I have also made good progress with the second one,
    which represents a coalyard on the grounds of the Rhine railway
    station as I see it from my studio window.</p>

    <p>There are heaps of coal and men working in them and people
    coming with little wheelbarrows to buy a sack of coals, for
    which there is sometimes a great demand; and especially with
    the snow last winter, it was an intriguing sight.</p>

    <p>I have been thinking it over for a long time, and a few days
    ago it was so splendid one evening and I made my sketch in such
    a way that later I made hardly any changes in the main lines of
    the composition. Then I had a man as a model right on the spot;
    he climbed onto those heaps of coal and stood in different
    spots so that I could see the proportion of the figure in
    different places.</p>

    <p>But since then I have made several figure studies for it,
    though the figures will only be small.</p>

    <p>Just while making these studies, the plan for an even larger
    drawing is beginning to take root, namely one of potato
    digging, and I am so absorbed in it that I think you will
    perhaps find something in it, too.</p>

    <p>I should want the landscape to be a level ground with a
    little row of dunes on the horizon. The figures about a foot
    high, a broad composition, 1 by 2.</p>

    <p>Right in front, in a corner, as a setoff, kneeling figures
    of women gathering the potatoes.</p>

    <p>On the second plane, a row of diggers, men and women.</p>

    <p>And I want to make the perspective of the field <i>such</i>
    that the spot where the wheelbarrows arrive is in the corner of
    the drawing opposite the one where the potatoes are being
    gathered.</p>

    <p>Well, except for the figures of the kneeling women, I could
    already show you all the other figures in large studies.</p>

    <p>Yes, I should like to start that drawing one of these days.
    I have the grounds pretty well in my mind, and will choose a
    fine potato field at my ease and make studies of it for the
    lines of the landscape.</p>

    <p>The drawing ought to be finished - at least an elaborate
    sketch of it - toward autumn, when the potatoes are dug, and I
    should only have to put in the finishing touches.</p>

    <p>Last year I saw it here, the year before last I saw it in
    Brabant, where it was splendid, and the year before that in the
    Borinage, where it was done by miners. So it has ripened in my
    mind.</p>

    <p>The figures ought to be such that it would be true
    everywhere, rather than a costume study.</p>

    <p>Well, that blank canvas preoccupies me continually, and
    while making studies, I am already looking for new ones.</p>

    <p>The row of diggers must be a row of dark figures, seen only
    in the distance, but very elaborate and varied in movement and
    type. For instance, a simple young fellow beside one of those
    typical old Scheveningen men, in a white and brown patched suit
    with an old top hat, such a dull black one which they push back
    on the neck; for instance, a short, sturdy figure of a woman
    soberly clad in black, beside a tall grass mower in white
    trousers, Tight blue frock and straw hat - a bald head next to
    a young woman. These thoughts rise in my mind because of the
    contrast in the studies I have made already.</p>

    <p>We must wait and see. But anyhow, I have bought a large
    stretcher (an old picture frame) at Laarman's and put canvas
    over it. And every day it becomes clearer to me, but it is
    confoundedly difficult to find figures which contrast well with
    each other and yet can be put in a very narrow space. And one
    has to draw each of them three times or more before it fits
    well.</p>

    <p>But I shall make the sketch and do the same with it as I did
    with the refuse dump, that is, begin it anew later, on another
    sheet, if the first one doesn't turn out as I wish. But I
    wanted it almost finished about the real time of potato
    digging, though I may have to work it up again on a new
    sheet.</p>

    <p>It was a good thing that I went to see Rappard, for I really
    got the first idea of making those large drawings there, and I
    have observed that one feels more definitely what kind of
    studies one has to make while composing. I am working with
    great animation these days, and am relatively untired because I
    am so interested in it. As you know, I had repressed my desire
    to make compositions for a long time, and in that respect a
    revolution has taken place in me now because the time was ripe
    for it, and I breathe more freely now that I have loosened the
    reins which I had put on myself. But I believe it was a good
    thing after all that I drudged so long on the studies; for it
    is true in all things, especially with regard to figures, that
    one must study seriously, and not suppose that one knows it
    already. I think it such a fine saying of Mauve's -
    notwithstanding all his work and experience, he says, Sometimes
    I do not know the place of the <i>joints</i> in a cow.<label content="art.technique"> At
    present I personally often do it this way: when I draw a digger
    putting one leg in front of the other, or one arm in front of
    the other, or bending his head, I still draw in detail the leg,
    the arm, which disappeared behind the first one and
    consequently is out of sight or the neck and back of the head;
    and only then do I draw what comes in sight, to get it as
    correct as possible.</label></p>

    <p>I hope I shall succeed in having the outline or ghost of the
    potato drawing ready by the time you come. I long very much to
    see you. Do you know anything more definite about your coming?
    Well, I must set to work on my coal men.</p>

    <p>For the moment my entire supply of ready cash consists of a
    postal order for 1.23 guilders torn in two, which has already
    been refused once. So I need not tell you that I am already on
    the lookout for your letter. As a diversion I have just fixed
    the large frame, and so that I shall be able to work before I
    get the money on those days when I may not be able to take a
    model. But perhaps I shall after all.</p>

    <p>My Scheveningen cape is a splendid possession; I made three
    elaborate studies with it: a woman with a dustbin and two
    others with wheelbarrows.</p>

    <p>The next time you send money, I hope to be able to get a
    fisherman's jacket with high turn-up collar and short sleeves,
    and a woman's bonnet. It seems the bonnets are expensive and
    difficult to get; well, at all events, I already have one.
    <i>Scheveningen drawings must be done as well, and shortly
    too</i>. About this time last year, I was in the hospital -
    last summer's painted studies are bad and incorrect, I find - I
    think of it because I have just been looking up an old painted
    study of those coal heaps to see how the situation was last
    year: I now think them done in too slovenly a fashion, in too
    much of a hurry.</p>

    <p>Well, since then, I have concentrated anew on the drawing of
    the figure, and I think only very vaguely of painting. Adieu,
    write as soon as you can. Good luck! With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
