  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for the letter and for the enclosure.</p>

    <p>I read your letter with great interest. I am glad that you
    are aware from what quarter the difficulties will probably
    arise, that - without doing it on purpose - women like, for
    instance, S. (however good they may be in other ways) are not
    very careful about what they say, etc. when you refer to the
    tie between your patient and her own mother, that's a thing
    about which I cannot wish you joy. However, it is nothing
    unusual.</p>

    <p>But it is a sad thought indeed, that a thing like the
    relation between mother and daughter can have a dark side, so
    that a man who loves <i>light</i> and seeks it can be fatally
    thwarted.</p>

    <p>A mother's influence and conversation with friends, more
    than anything else, sometimes bring a kind of backsliding in
    women which prevents a reform in thought and action - sometimes
    so urgently necessary.</p>

    <p>I'm glad you are not fully aware of what may be in store for
    you from that quarter, but I'm not glad you weren't spared this
    - if the woman were unhampered by her relations, you might
    expect fewer difficulties for the future, I think.</p>

    <p>And the trouble is that it's impossible to predict exactly
    in what form the difficulties may crop up, and when taking
    certain precautionary measures, one can't help thinking, Yes,
    but it's quite possible that I shall have to manouever in
    precisely the opposite way.</p>

    <p>In a certain preface Zola makes the following remark:
    &ldquo;Ces femmes ne sont cependant pas mauvaises,
    l'impossibitit&eacute; d'une vie droite dans les
    comm&eacute;rages et les m&eacute;disances des faubourgs, est
    la cause de leurs fautes et de leurs ch&ucirc;tes.&rdquo; [Yet
    these woman are not bad, the impossibility of (living) a
    straight life in the midst of the gossip and calumny of the
    suburbs is the cause of their faults and their fall.]</p>

    <p>If the woman is cultivated enough to understand your
    thoughts and views and consequently take part in your inner
    life, this would mean a strong tie which could neutralize many
    difficulties.</p>

    <p>Entering into relations with her family, I'm afraid, would
    bring the drawback of falling into officialism (people
    sometimes very indiscreetly take it like that) whereas one
    intended only privacy and nothing official. Not everybody's
    intention is to act silently, and some older and wiser members
    of the family often get so clamorous that one regrets having
    spoken to them. The more so, because they cannot stop
    intriguing and, oh well - they are probably wolves.</p>

    <p>I wish we were not so far away from each other. Yesterday I
    wrote you in detail about some difficulties which will perhaps
    present themselves to you soon, but the feeling that there are
    times when I myself do not know how to face them kept me from
    sending the letter; besides, I am quite confident that true
    love cannot die, at least not if one acts with judgement at the
    same time. But I should like to scratch this out again because
    it isn't correct, for love can certainly die - but there is a
    strength of revival in love.</p>

    <p>Ce que l'homme tue Dieu le ressuscite [What man kills God
    resuscitates].</p>

    <p>Van der Weele has come to see me again. Perhaps he will
    bring me into contact with Piet van der Velden, whom I think
    you will know from his figures of peasants and fishermen.</p>

    <p>Once I met Van der Velden, and he made a very good
    impression - he reminded me of Eliot's character of Felix Holt,
    the radical. There is something broad and rough in him which
    appeals to me very much - something of the roughness of
    torchon. A man who apparently doesn't seek culture in outward
    things, but who is inwardly much, very much further than
    most.</p>

    <p>Well, he is a real artist, and I wish I knew him, for I have
    confidence in him, and I know for sure that I should learn from
    him. It's not impossible that I shall meet him someday even if
    it isn't through Van der Weele.</p>

    <p>Rappard would have come to see me last Monday, but then he
    wrote his sister had fallen ill, and he couldn't come. Perhaps
    he will come this week.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">At present there isn't a single drawing in which I do not
    work with brush and printer's ink.</label></p>

    <p>To tell you the truth, my purse is rather empty; it
    certainly isn't your fault, yet it isn't mine, either - no
    matter how I contrive, I can't save more, and I need more money
    than I have to execute some plans. If I started on those
    things, I should have to give them up in the middle. But it is
    a melancholy thing to have to say, &ldquo;I could make such and
    such a thing if it weren't for the expense.&rdquo; Then an
    unsatisfied energy remains, which one should wish to use
    instead of stifle. But I don't want to complain - I am grateful
    that I can make progress - though not so vigorously as I should
    wish. But the English say, &ldquo;Time is money,&rdquo; and
    sometimes I can't help thinking it is hard to see the time pass
    during which things might have been done if I had had the
    means.</p>

    <p>You will understand what I mean: I should wish to be able to
    spend more, both on models and on painting materials. Though I
    do not sell a single one of my studies, I think they are worth
    the money I spend on them. The studio has become so much better
    and convenient, but I only have enough steam for &ldquo;half
    speed,&rdquo; and should like to go &ldquo;full
    speed.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I repeat, I do not say this to complain, nor to force you to
    greater sacrifices - you are really burdened beyond your
    strength too. But I say it for the sake of a better
    understanding, and to relieve my mind. For you will understand
    that I am often full of heavy cares. Well, we must make the
    best of it, and the things we can't move by force must be
    undermined by patience.</p>

    <p>This week I drew a few reclining figures; some time I shall
    need figures of corpses or of sick people, men as well as
    women.</p>

    <p>Recently I passed Isra&euml;ls's house - I have never been
    inside - the front door was open, as the servant was scrubbing
    the hall. I saw things hanging in the hall, and do you know
    what they were? the <art id=erkomer2>large Herkomer, &ldquo;Last Muster, Sunday
    at Chelsea,&rdquo;</art> and the photograph of that picture by Roll,
    &ldquo;Gr&egrave;ve de Charbonniers,&rdquo; which you perhaps
    remember I wrote you about at the time [see Letter 238]. I
    didn't know that there existed a photograph of the &ldquo;Last
    Muster.&rdquo; I possess the large wood engraving of the two
    principal figures, and the first rough sketch made long before
    the picture.</p>

    <p>Well, adieu, boy, my best wishes for your patient, success
    in your work.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
