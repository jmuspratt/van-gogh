  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter and for the money.</p>

    <p>When I read and reread your letters about your patient, I am
    reminded of many things. And I should like to write and ask you
    much more about it, but as I know the person only from your
    letters, it is all too vague and undefined, and more than once
    I have torn up a letter because of this, but believe me, I
    think of it all the time, and I can very well understand, and
    perfectly agree with you, that except for the melancholy idea
    of her suffering, such an encounter is a thing for which you
    feel grateful, and consider it uncommon good fortune. That
    <i>je ne sais quoi</i> coming from the heath, or whatever it is
    that reminds you of her native country, that old coast of
    Brittany, is something which I think will become stronger
    rather than weaker the longer you are with her. Your
    expression, &ldquo;Later on will she be like the dog with the
    shepherd or something better?&rdquo; is rather characteristic.
    Don't you think it probable that one time will differ greatly
    from another? There are so many different phases or
    metamorphoses in any one love, <i>just because of the
    faithfulness to that one love</i> - so that it changes all the
    time.</p>

    <p>That operation will be a hard time - if I were you I
    shouldn't say too much to her about finding a situation later,
    as the future is so undecided because of her foot <sup>1</sup>
    - better leave it undecided. For I should be afraid that, for
    instance, in a crisis of pain she might quite wrongly get the
    notion fixed in her head, &ldquo;I must do this or that,&rdquo;
    which often happens to sick women. It might make her obstinate,
    contrary to the feelings of her own heart, which would pain you
    because you would only have mentioned the idea of a situation
    out of delicacy, to make her feel that her future was <i>free
    and independent</i>; and she might assume that you felt more
    indifferent about her than is really the case. Perhaps I
    express myself too vaguely, but women do not always understand
    delicacy, any more than they do humour; and though one must
    certainly act with delicacy, it often gives rise to
    misunderstandings (though, in my opinion, one isn't responsible
    for them) which, in short, make life more difficult.</p>

    <p>I do not know whether Heyerdahl, for instance, would find
    anything picturesque in the daily activities of the woman whom
    I live with. But Daumier certainly would.</p>

    <p>I thought of Heyerdahl's saying, &ldquo;Je n'aime pas qu'une
    figure soit trop corrumpue&rdquo; [I don't like a figure to be
    too misshapen], when I was drawing - not the woman, but an old
    man with a bandaged eye - and I found it <i>not</i> true. There
    are some ruins of physiognomies which are full of expression,
    as, for instance, &ldquo;Malle [Mad] Babbe&rdquo; by Frans Hals
    or some heads by Rembrandt.</p>

    <p>As to Heyerdahl, I do not doubt that his <i>intentions</i>
    were all right when he made this statement, otherwise I don't
    think it would hold water.</p>

    <p>In the last letter I wrote you I asked casually about
    Lhermitte's work. In the articles about the Black and White he
    is nearly always singled out as &ldquo;the Millet and Jules
    Breton of Black and White.&rdquo; There was, for instance, a
    description of a drawing of old women on the cliffs, and about
    his technique they said there was none more daring, bold, or
    strong than he, even astonishingly so, and other drawings
    couldn't be compared to his, and that his touch was broader
    than the broadest. They also compared him with Legros, but only
    with the most extraordinary, most exceptional drawings or
    etchings by Legros, which are also very strong and broad, for
    instance, &ldquo;The Pew.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="health.eyes">Boy, I still feel poorly, and I've had a rather plain
    warning that I must be careful - my eyes felt so tired
    sometimes, but I wouldn't pay any attention to it. Now, last
    night, especially, there was a rather strong secretion of the
    tear glands, and the lashes stuck together, and my eyes are
    giving me trouble and my sight is poor.</label></p>

    <p>Ever since the middle of December I have been drudging
    incessantly, especially on those heads. This last week I have
    been out-of-doors a good deal to refresh myself. I have taken
    baths, washed my head often with cold water, etc., etc. But one
    feels so miserable at such a time; I have a large pile of
    studies, but they don't interest me then, and I find them all
    bad.</p>

    <p>Rappard wrote me again this week; he said he was recovering,
    but slowly, still feels weak but is beginning to walk a little
    bit now and then. But he wrote very clearly and plainly about
    many things concerning the work.</p>

    <p>There is a spring feeling in the air already, and it will
    not be long before the lark sings over the meadows again.</p>

    <p>Do you think you will be able to get here this spring???</p>

    <p>I am rather afraid not. I am eager to talk this winter's
    studies over with you, and also with Rappard; he will come here
    sometime, when he is quite recovered.</p>

    <p>I will take a few weeks' rest, and be out-of-doors as much
    as possible to refresh my thoughts. I want to use my studies
    for watercolours, for instance, but at present it's no use.</p>

    <p><label content="health.eyes">Right now my eyes and my face look as if I had been on a
    spree, which, of course, has not been the case - on the
    contrary - but who knows, maybe someone I meet on the street
    who hasn't seen me for a while will remark that I am obviously
    on the road to dissipation. Those things are sometimes so
    absurd that I can't help laughing.</label></p>

    <p>In the evening at sunset there are effects of dark clouds
    with silver linings that are splendid, for instance, when one
    is walking in Bezuidenhout or along the edge of the wood. You
    will remember that from long ago. It is also beautiful outside
    my studio window, or in the meadows; one feels the spring from
    afar, and now and then there is something balmy in the air.</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, thanks again for your letter, and best wishes
    for your patient. I hope that I shall soon find again a drawing
    or a study that interests me - it is so unpleasant when one
    must take a rest. One <i>cannot</i> rest for the very reason
    that one <i>must</i>. Adieu. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
