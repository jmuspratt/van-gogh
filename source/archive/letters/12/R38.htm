  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I want to write you another letter while you are travelling.
    <sup>1</sup> Thanks for the package of books. I should like to
    apply Zola's own words about Hugo to Zola's Mes Haines:
    &ldquo;Je voudrais d&eacute;montrer qu'&eacute;tant
    donn&eacute; un tel homme sur un tel sujet le r&eacute;sultat
    ne pourrait &ecirc;tre un autre livre qu'il n'est.&rdquo; [I
    wanted to demonstrate that given such a man writing on such a
    subject, the result could only be such a book.] And moreover
    Zola's own words on the same occasion: &ldquo;Je ne cesserai de
    r&eacute;p&eacute;ter: la critique de ce livre, telle qu'elle
    s'est exerc&eacute;e, me para&icirc;t une monstrueuse
    injustice.&rdquo; [I won't stop repeating: the criticism of
    this book, as it is exercised, seems to me a monstrous
    injustice.]</p>

    <p>I'll very gladly begin in this matter by saying that I
    consequently do <i>not</i> belong to those who think ill of
    Zola for writing such a book. Through it I come to know Zola, I
    come to know Zola's weak point - deficient ideas on the art of
    painting - pr&eacute;jug&eacute;s instead of jugement juste in
    this special matter. But, my dear friend, shall I feel offended
    by a friend of mine because of a fault in his character? - far
    be it from me. On the contrary, I love him all the more for his
    fault. So I read the articles on the Salon with a very peculiar
    feeling; I thought him enormously mistaken, his ideas entirely
    wrong, except partly his appreciation of Manet - I think Manet
    clever too - but it is very interesting to read Zola's ideas
    about art, as interesting, so to speak, as a landscape by a
    figure painter, for instance. It isn't his genre, it's
    superficial - incorrect, but what a conception - not carried
    through - never mind - not quite clear - never mind - it makes
    one think and is original and at least sparkling with life. But
    for all that, it's wrong and most inaccurate and unjustified.
    It is very interesting to hear what he has to say about
    Erckmann-Chatrian. Here he doesn't shoot so wildly at random as
    when he talks about pictures, and his criticism hits the mark
    damned accurately at times. I take the greatest pleasure in
    permitting him to reproach Erckmann-Chatrian for mixing a
    certain amount of egoism with his <i>[sic,</i> their] morality.
    He is furthermore right in saying that when Erckmann-Chatrian
    starts <i>[sic]</i> describing Parisian life he <i>[sic]</i>
    gets too insipid because he is not at home with the subject. As
    for this criticism, however, there is the question by way of
    contrast, Is Zola at home with the subject of the Alsace? - and
    if he were, wouldn't he be more interested in Erckmann's
    figures, which are as beautiful as those of Knaus and
    Vautier?</p>

    <p>As regards the &ldquo;little mustard seed&rdquo; of egoism
    in most of the characters - and Erckmann seems to side with
    them - Old Rabbi David and Wagner and Th&eacute;r&egrave;se - I
    think here the somewhat egoistic Erckmann-Chatrian approach the
    sublime, and he <i>[sic]</i> is hors ligne because of this.</p>

    <p>Zola has this much in common with Balzac, that he knows
    little about painting. Two types of painters in Zola's works -
    Claude Lantier in Le Ventre de Paris and another one in
    Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Raquin - vague shadows of Manet, I think
    - a kind of impressionist. So much for that.</p>

    <p>Well, Balzac's painters are enormously tedious, very
    boring.</p>

    <p>Now, here I should like to go on talking about myself, but I
    am no critic. But I want to add this: I am glad he lands Taine
    one in the eye; Taine deserves it, for at times he is
    irritating with his mathematical analysis. But despite that he
    (Taine) arrives through it at some curiously profound
    statements. So I read one of his pronouncements - about Dickens
    and Carlyle - &ldquo;Le fond du caract&egrave;re anglais, c'est
    l'absence du bonheur.&rdquo; [the foundation of the English
    character is the absence of happiness.] Now I won't insist on
    the greater or lesser correctness of these words, but will
    point out that such words are proofs of very deep reflection,
    of forcing the eyes to penetrate into the darkness until one
    has finally seen something in it, whereas anybody else would
    see nothing. I think those words beautiful, damned beautiful,
    and they mean more to me than a thousand other words on the
    -same problem, and so in this case I have the greatest respect
    for Taine.</p>

    <p>Now I am delighted to be able to look through the Boughtons
    and Abbeys at my leisure. I think &ldquo;In the Potato
    Field&rdquo; the most beautiful of all, and the &ldquo;Bell
    Ringers&rdquo; by Abbey. Text somewhat dry, somewhat cluttered
    with stories about hotels and antique dealers - I enjoy reading
    it. Why so? - for the same reason that I read that book by Zola
    - because of the personality of the man who wrote it.</p>

    <p>Have you noticed that Zola doesn't mention Millet at all?
    And yet I have read descriptions by Zola of a village
    churchyard and a deathbed and the funeral of a poor old peasant
    which were as beautiful as if they were Millets. Consequently
    this omission is probably due to his not being acquainted with
    Millet's work.</p>

    <p>I also want to tell you that I have found an uncommonly
    beautiful sheet by T. Green, a brother or something of C.
    Green. It is a &ldquo;feast&rdquo; in a London foundling
    hospital, orphan girls of some kind sitting at the table. Oh,
    you'll be crazy about it.</p>

    <p>By the same, a smaller one besides, &ldquo;A City
    Congregation,&rdquo; drawn as delicately, as exquisitely as
    &ldquo;Braemar&rdquo; by our friend J.M.L.R.</p>

    <p>I have found two more sheets by this sphinx J.M.L.R. - whose
    name we have not been able to decipher so far, but whom I
    suppose to be a brother, or at least a relation, of W. M.
    Ridley - one &ldquo;The Ascent of Mount Vesuvius&rdquo; and the
    other &ldquo;A Game of Football,&rdquo; both of them good, but
    not so excellent as the &ldquo;Braemar Coach.&rdquo; I know a
    &ldquo;Salmon Fishers&rdquo; by him too and also
    &ldquo;Volunteers in Camp&rdquo;; the latter sheet gave me a
    clue to his name.</p>

    <p>And further, by A. Hunt, &ldquo;A Procession of Monks in the
    Snow,&rdquo; as beautiful as a Legros; by W. M. Ridley,
    &ldquo;London Bridge&rdquo; and &ldquo;Emigrants&rdquo;; by
    Buckmann, two &ldquo;Markets&rdquo; drawn particularly broadly
    and boldly and in a wholehearted manner.</p>

    <p>By Barnard, &ldquo;Hampstead Heath&rdquo; - &ldquo;First to
    Come, Last to Go&rdquo; - &ldquo;How the Poor Live.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>By Hopkins, &ldquo;Children on the Sea Beach,&rdquo; very
    delicate of tone. By Millets [? - probably Millais] himself, a
    beautiful sheet, &ldquo;Christmas Stories.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>By Birken Forster, &ldquo;Winter Landscapes&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;Christmas Time,&rdquo; very cozy.</p>

    <p>Two important Gavarnis, first rates, &ldquo;Forts de la
    Halle&rdquo; [Porters of the Vegetable Market], &ldquo;Dames de
    la Halle&rdquo; [Women of the Vegetable Market] and &ldquo;Les
    &Eacute;trennes&rdquo; [The Gifts].</p>

    <p>Then R&eacute;gameys - beautiful Japanese motifs and a very
    large sheet, a masterpiece, &ldquo;The Diamond Field,&rdquo;
    and another large composition, &ldquo;Le Boeuf gras&rdquo; [The
    Fat Ox].</p>

    <p>And by M. F. a sheet of medium size representing the
    treadmill in a prison, as beautiful as a R&eacute;gamey.</p>

    <p>By I don't know whom, a marvellous thing of the steelworks
    in Sheffield; it is called &ldquo;The Fork Grinders.&rdquo; It
    is in the style of Edmond Morin, that is to say, his most
    compact and concise style.</p>

    <p>You see, it isn't so very much, but they are beautiful
    things, every one of them, and I consider them an important
    acquisition.</p>

    <p>By <i>Howard Pyle</i>, a very fine &ldquo;Figure of a
    Woman,&rdquo; and also beautiful landscapes by I. Reud.</p>

    <p>Perhaps there are more, but these are the most
    important.</p>

    <p>If you have already gone away on your trip, then tell me how
    your drawing is getting on.</p>

    <p>I am working on the &ldquo;Potato Diggers&rdquo;; I also
    have a single figure of an old man and then a series of rough
    studies done during the potato harvest - a man burning weeds, a
    fellow with a sack, another one with a wheelbarrow, etc.</p>

    <p>When you have returned from your trip I hope you will take
    measures to pay me an early visit.</p>

    <p>I have also done another &ldquo;Sower,&rdquo; perhaps the
    seventh or eighth study of that subject. This time I have put
    him in the open air on a large field with little clods of earth
    and a sky above it. I want very much to ask Zola a question
    that I should like to put to others too - &ldquo;Just tell me,
    is it really true that there is no difference between a red
    earthenware dish with a cod in it, for instance, and, say, the
    figure of a digger or a sower? Is there or isn't there a
    difference between Rembrandt and Van Beyeren (technically
    equally clever), between Volton and Millet?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Have you paid attention to that new magazine, Pictorial
    News? There are good things in it now and then, but most of
    them aren't worth much.</p>

    <p>My dear friend, I wish we could meet more often, but qu'y
    faire! Do write again, if you have time and feel so inclined. I
    don't think the summer numbers of the Graphic and the London
    News particularly good. The Graphic has a beautiful Caldecott,
    however, which is the best one. And some things by Reinhardt,
    not of the best. London News, Caton Woodvilles again.</p>

    <p>I suppose you will think the sheets I wrote about more
    interesting. &ldquo;Diamond Field&rdquo; by R&eacute;gamey
    isn't striking at all at first sight, but the more you look at
    it the more you admire it. The T. Greens are masterpieces.</p>

    <p>My brother wrote me a letter about an exceptionally fine
    exhibition in Paris, etc., &ldquo;Les Cent
    Chefs-d'Oeuvre&rdquo; [The Hundred Masterpieces].</p>

    <p>Adieu, my dear friend, a pleasant journey, remember to write
    to me, i.e. if there is time for it. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
