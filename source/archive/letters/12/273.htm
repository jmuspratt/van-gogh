    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>I didn't intend to write so soon again - but as you know, I
    am trying to do different kinds of drawings. And now again
    today I made another sketch with the rest of that little piece
    of crayon - and afterward washed it in with sepia. I think I
    find in this crayon all kinds of qualities which make it an
    excellent means of expressing things from nature.</p>

    <p>This morning I took a walk outside the town, in the meadows
    behind the Zuidbuitensingel where Maris first lived, and where
    the public ash dump is. I stood there a long time, looking at a
    row of the most twisted, gnarled, sorry-looking pollard willows
    I have ever seen. They bordered a path of vegetable garden -
    freshly dug up - and they were mirrored in a dirty little ditch
    - very dirty - but in which some blades of spring grass were
    already sparkling. But that rough brown bark, the freshly
    spaded earth, in which one could see the fertility, as it were
    - it all had something so intensely rich in the dark deep tones
    that it reminded me again of this crayon. So that as soon as I
    have some more, I hope to try my hand at landscape.</p>

    <p>Though the enclosed sketch is very unfinished, it seemed to
    me there might be things in it compatible with your intentions
    - and again, it is a &ldquo;sketch from life.&rdquo; Don't
    think I consider it of good quality, even if it isn't detailed
    enough - far from it; but the elaborateness which you as well
    as I should like to see in it doesn't consist so much of
    details added later, but ought to be expressed at once, more
    than is the case now. For it must not lose its freshness that
    way, and, if only the impression is correct, sometimes there is
    expression even in unfinished things. But of course I shall try
    to bring more variation into the tones. &ldquo;Y mettre des
    d&eacute;tails&rdquo; leaves me rather cool, but
    &ldquo;d&eacute;grossit&rdquo; [take away the coarseness] is
    certainly my aim, that is, &ldquo;serrer la forme de plus
    pr&egrave;s&rdquo; [concentrating the form more firmly]. Though
    this sketch is not sufficiently so, that little bit of sepia
    made so much difference in the general effect that, comparing
    it to yesterday's, I thought you could see the different ways
    in which that crayon can be used.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I wrote Rappard about the crayon yesterday, because I had to
    write him about various things concerning lithography; and as I
    wanted to send him a few sketches done with it, I used it for
    some drawings of our baby, in different positions, and I found
    it is very well suited to sketching, too. One also can bring in
    demitones by means of breadcrumbs. Perhaps only the very
    deepest shadows can't be done very well with it, but in many
    cases one can use lithographic crayon then, which is also very
    rich in tone.</label></p>

    <p>I think you will see from the figures how the studio has
    improved as to light. How beautiful everything out-of-doors is
    these days, don't you think so?</p>

    <p>You can imagine that I am full of plans.</p>

    <p>You know that I am working on many different things, for I
    should so much like to know many different techniques; because
    it stimulates one to work hard, and creates new ideas.</p>

    <p>I wish I had thought of that crayon before, for it is
    preferable to many other things. Nor is it as hard as a
    cont&eacute; pencil - that is, it doesn't scratch so.</p>

    <p>I don't ask you to send me some because I could not work
    without it, but because with it, I could make many other things
    in addition to my usual work.</p>

    <p>Did I already write you about those two large etchings by
    Isra&euml;ls, a man lighting his pipe and the interior of a
    workman's home? How beautiful they are. I think it is so
    splendid of Isra&euml;ls to go on with his etching, the more so
    because all the others have given it up, notwithstanding the
    enthusiasm with which the etching club was originally started.
    At least, most of them haven't made any progress in etching,
    and if they make an etching now, it is no better or more
    perfect than what they did years ago. But father Isra&euml;ls,
    notwithstanding his grey hairs, is still young enough to make
    progress - and great progress, too - and I call this real youth
    and lasting vitality.</p>

    <p>Confound it, if the others had done the same, what beautiful
    Dutch etchings would have been given to the world. I have two
    little etchings by Isra&euml;ls, perhaps his very first, a
    little girl with a spade in a garden, and a woman with a basket
    on her back; do you know them? I believe the Belgian
    Aquafortistes publish it.</p>

    <p>So with that little bit of crayon <art id=1072>I have </art>already made two
    sketches, and some small croquis, too, and there is still some
    left. I think perhaps in the future I am going to use little
    else for the ordinary work.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
