  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and thanks for the enclosure. Today
    is Sunday, and I have been working furiously this week, and now
    today I am sitting down quietly to write you somewhat more
    extensively than I have been able to of late, because there
    were so many things to distract me. And I particularly want to
    write to you because I see from your letter that things are not
    going so well with you, and I want to write somewhat more
    cordially than usual.</p>

    <p>If in my own case - considering my small income - Father and
    Mother should raise objections to my marrying on account of my
    having no money, I could approve of it to a certain extent, at
    least understand why they talked this way and gave in. But,
    Theo, now that in <i>your</i> case - knowing that you have a
    permanent position and a good salary (nota bene, considerably
    more than their own) - they raise the same objection, I can
    only say that I think it unutterably pretentious and downright
    ungodly. <label content="attitude.clergy">In point of fact, clergymen are among the most
    unbelieving people in society and dry materialists. Perhaps not
    right in the pulpit, but in private matters.</label> From a moral point
    of view one might be allowed to object to a marriage if real
    <i>want of bread</i> in its literal sense were to be expected;
    but as I see it, such an objection utterly loses its moral
    justification as soon as there is no question of <i>actual want
    of bread</i>. And it would be ridiculous to predict want of
    <i>bread</i> in your case.</p>

    <p>Suppose somebody like old Mr. Goupil should raise monetary
    objections - from his point of view as a rich merchant, one
    could not expect anything else.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">But coming from Father and Mother, who ought to be humble
    and contented with simple things, I think their speaking that
    way very wicked, and I feel something like shame at their
    behaviour.</p>

    <p>I wish we only strove for peace in our homes, and stinted
    ourselves rather than strain after a high position. And used
    our energy to increase our spiritual refinement and humaneness,
    but were contented with the most simple things as a matter of
    principle.</p>

    <p>So I regret it, and it grieves me; again, I am horribly
    disappointed at Father and Mother saying such a thing.</label></p>

    <p>I should be willing to do anything to undo this.</p>

    <p>I should like to be proud of Father, because he is truly a
    poor village preacher in the pure sense of the Gospel, but I
    think it so rotten that Father stoops to such considerations as
    something not being in keeping with &ldquo;the dignity of his
    calling.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>My opinion is that one might expect Father to co-operate as
    soon as the question of saving a woman arises. It would be
    right to be on <i>her</i> side, because she is poor and
    deserted.</p>

    <p>By not doing so, Father commits an enormous error: it is
    inhuman for anyone to do such a thing; doubly so, however, if
    he is a servant of the Gospel.</p>

    <p>Thwarting the interests of such a woman, preventing her
    rescue, is monstrous.</p>

    <p>Oh, I know very well that nearly all clergymen would use the
    same language as Father - and for this reason I reckon the
    whole lot of them among the most ungodly men in our
    society.</p>

    <p>You and I also sometimes do things which are perhaps sinful;
    but for all that, we are not merciless, and we feel pity, and
    for the very reason that we do not consider ourselves perfect
    and know how things can happen, we do not revile fallen or
    frail women as the clergymen do, as if they themselves were the
    only ones at fault. And now this woman of yours is, moreover, a
    decent woman of a middle-class family, and I really think
    Father's error <i>serious</i>.</p>

    <p>Suppose there were objections - my opinion is that Father,
    because he is a shepherd, ought to urge you on to help her and
    put up with difficulties for the sake of her preservation. One
    ought to find comfort from people like Father when society does
    not give comfort - but not they! - they are even worse than
    ordinary people.</p>

    <p>It is horrible that Father assumes this attitude.</p>

    <p>When Father was here, he spoke disapprovingly of my being
    with the woman, and then I told him I did not refuse to marry
    her.</p>

    <p>Then Father <i>evaded</i> the point, and started talking in
    generalities.</p>

    <p>He did not want to tell me I ought to desert her on the
    spot, but he regretted that I had relations with her.</p>

    <p>For the rest, I talked but little with Father about the
    matter, seeing that I do not exactly consider him the person to
    be concerned in it. You have done your duty by informing Father
    and Mother of the affair, but now that they talk the way they
    do, I am of the opinion that they have given you the right to
    exclude them from certain confidences and to consult them less
    than you would if they were more reasonable. Their error is
    that they are not humble and humane enough in this case.</p>

    <p>Now you write that business is less flourishing. This is
    rotten enough. But the position has always been precarious, and
    may be expected to remain so as long as you live. Let us keep
    up our courage, and try to find energy and serenity.</p>

    <p>I can tell you that my first composition, of which I sent
    you a sketch, is almost finished. First I made the drawing in
    charcoal, then worked it over with brush and printer's ink. So
    there is some pith in it, and I think when you look at it for
    the second time, you will find more in it than you did at
    first.</p>

    <p>Besides, since I sent you this sketch I made a second
    drawing, of a similar subject.</p>

    <p>Do you remember that once you described (last year) an
    accident in a stone quarry in the Butte Montmartre where you
    saw a group of workmen, one of whom had been badly hurt in the
    quarry? Well, this is a similar case, but simply the group of
    men at work.</p>

    <p>I was with Van der Weele in Dekker's Dune, where we saw that
    sand pit; and since then I have gone there regularly and had a
    model every day, and now the second drawing is also done.</p>

    <p><art id=1029>It represents men with wheelbarrows and men who
    are digging</art>.</p>

    <p>I shall try to make a sketch of it too, but it is a
    complicated composition and can hardly be judged from a sketch,
    any more than the other one can.</p>

    <p>The figures have been drawn after painstaking studies</p>

    <p>I should like very much to have these reproduced</p>

    <p>The first one is on grey paper, the other, on yellow.</p>

    <p>I long very much, Theo to have you in the studio again, for
    there are so many studies, and now you can see what I was
    aiming at when I made the studies, and they may furnish the raw
    material for many more things.</p>

    <p>I have had a frame made, or rather a passe-partout of
    ordinary wood, and have given it a walnut colour with a black
    inner strip; that shuts off the drawing very well, and it is
    pleasant working in the frame.</p>

    <p>I have made arrangements for other larger compositions, and
    I have again stretchers for two new ones ready; I should also
    like to do the tree felling in the wood, and the refuse dump
    with the dustmen, and the potato digging in the dunes.</p>

    <p>It was a good thing that I went to see Rappard, for his
    sympathy has cheered me where I hadn't enough self-confidence.
    But when you see these drawings, Theo, and the studies, you
    will understand that this year I have had as much care and
    trouble as a man can bear. It is devilishly difficult to hammer
    out a figure. And indeed, it is the same as with iron - one
    works on a model, and goes on working, at first with no result;
    but at last it mellows, and one finds the figure, like the
    iron, becomes malleable when it is hot, and <i>then</i> one
    must go on working on it. So I had a model continually for
    these two drawings, and worked on them early and late.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">I am sorry to hear from you that business is rather slack;</label>
    if circumstances become more difficult, let us redouble our
    energy. I will be doubly intent on my drawings, but for the
    present do be doubly intent on sending the money. To me it
    means models, studio, bread; cutting it down would be something
    like choking or drowning me. I mean, I can do as little without
    it now as I can do without air. I had these two drawings in my
    heart for a long time, but I did not have the money to carry
    them out; and now, thanks to Rappard's money, they have got
    form. The creative power cannot be repressed, one must give
    vent to what one feels.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I often think? I should like to get into
    contact with the Graphic or London News in England. Now that I
    am getting on with it, I should like so much to continue a few
    large compositions suitable for illustration.</p>

    <p>Boughton and Abbey together are making drawings called
    &ldquo;Picturesque Holland&rdquo; for Harper's in New York
    (agent for the Graphic too). I saw those illustrations at
    Rappard's (very thoroughly done, small though they are and
    undoubtedly made after larger drawings). Now I say to myself,
    If the Graphic and Harper's send their draughtsmen to Holland,
    perhaps they would not be unwilling to take on a draughtsman
    from Holland if he can produce some good work and not too
    expensively.</p>

    <p>I should prefer being put on regular monthly wages to
    selling a drawing now and then at a relatively high price. And
    I should like to make a contract for a series of compositions,
    for instance, following up these two drawings I am working on
    now, or those I am going to do. I should think it advisable to
    go to London myself with studies and drawings and to visit the
    managers of the various establishments or, better still, the
    artists Herkomer, Green, Boughton (but some of them are in
    America at present) or others, if they are in London. And
    there, better than anywhere else, I should be able to get
    information about the different processes. Perhaps Rappard
    would come with me, and take drawings with him too. Such a
    thing, more or less modified, ought to be done, I think.</p>

    <p>Personally I could undertake to do one large drawing for a
    double-page engraving for illustration every month, and I will
    also apply myself to the other sizes, whole page and half
    page.</p>

    <p>I know perfectly well that reproductions can be made large
    or small, but a double page is more suitable for things done in
    a broad style; the smaller ones may be drawn in a different
    way, for instance, with pen and pencil.</p>

    <p>Now, I don't think it's every day that the managers of
    magazines find somebody who considers making illustrations his
    specialty.</p>

    <p>From the little sketch which I made after the large drawing
    just now, in a quarter of an hour, and which I enclose
    herewith, you will see that I don't mind making the size larger
    or smaller if necessary; when I know that a certain size is
    wanted, I can make it.</p>

    <p>But for my own study, I prefer the large size, so that I can
    study hands, feet, head in greater detail. Don't you think that
    a number of drawings of tree felling, etc., might be done in
    the same style in which I just did<art id=1031> &ldquo;Peat Cutters&rdquo;</art>
    and &ldquo;Sand Diggers&rdquo; - and in that way would be
    interesting enough to serve as illustrations?</p>

    <p>But I repeat, the money from you is absolutely indispensable
    to me as long as I have not found employment. Out of what I
    received from you today, I have to pay exactly as much as I
    received: I have <i>still to pay</i> three models who have
    posed several times. I have to pay the carpenter, to pay the
    rent, to pay the baker and the grocer and also the shoemaker,
    and I have to lay in some provisions. Then I have in front of
    me two blank sheets for new compositions, and must set to work
    on them. I shall again have to take a model every day, and
    struggle hard till I have got it down. Quand bien m&ecirc;me
    I'll get started, but you will understand that in a few days I
    shall be absolutely penniless, and then those terrible eight
    long days of not being able to do anything but wait, wait for
    the tenth of the month.</p>

    <p>Oh, boy, if we could only find somebody who would buy the
    drawings. The work is an absolute necessity for me. I can't put
    it off, I don't care for anything but the work; that is to say,
    the pleasure in something else ceases at once and I become
    melancholy when I can't go on with my work. Then I feel like a
    weaver who sees that his threads are tangled, and the pattern
    he had on the loom is gone to hell, and all his thought and
    exertion is lost.</p>

    <p>Try to arrange it so that we can go on with energy. I am
    going to ask permission to work in the old people's asylum. I
    have already made many studies of old men, but I must have the
    women too, and I must also draw the surroundings on the spot.
    Well, you also have to provide for the woman, so I suppose you
    know well enough that in this respect my life is not easy
    either, with two children into the bargain.</p>

    <p>I think it is so urgent that you see the studies and the
    large drawings, especially with the financial side in mind. You
    might take the same steps in Paris that I would take in London
    with regard to illustrations if you could show a few large
    drawings. But in that case I think it would be best not to
    begin before we were almost sure of their being readily
    accepted.</p>

    <p>These large compositions cause many expenses if one wants to
    treat them conscientiously. For, boy, it must all be done with
    the model; even if one uses studies, one must still retouch
    them again, using the model. If I could take even more models,
    I should be able to make them much, much better. So, boy, if
    you think I could manage without your help for once, I assure
    you I need it more than ever, but I show you our chance of
    success if we persevere. I have already bought several things
    with Rappard's money - sketching blocks, etc. - and everything
    you send is invested in drawings, and I think you will like
    those I am making now better than the first ones. So let us
    keep up our courage and energy.</p>

    <p>A great drawback for many things I should like to make on
    the beach is that I have no Scheveningen woman's dress. You
    understand, I could make a composition of Scheveningen figures
    such as the enclosed little sketch. But when I draw a figure
    out-of-doors, it is of course too superficial. It must be taken
    up again and finished with a model, and one needs the
    costumes.</p>

    <p>That expenditure, if I could afford it, would enable me to
    start two or three drawings I have in mind. But how can I do
    it? I repeat, within three days all the money I have now will
    be gone, I have to spend almost everything. For these two
    drawings I also needed a number of frocks, trousers,
    sou'wester, etc. A model does not always wear a good,
    picturesque frock; by changing it, it becomes more
    characteristic and arresting. When you come, you must see how
    elaborate the studies of the figures for the first plane of the
    sketch are. I made them out-of-doors on a sand heap in a
    florist's garden.</p>

    <p>In the beginning of your letter you write that you are glad
    there was no cause for anxiety about the woman. Well, it is
    true there is no direct reason for it, that is to say that in
    this respect too I try to preserve my serenity and good
    courage. But there are worries enough, heavy cares even, and
    difficulties are not wanting. I began trying to save the woman,
    notwithstanding the difficulties, and up to the present I have
    gone through with it, but in the future everything will not be
    couleur de rose either. Well, we must work as hard as we
    can.</p>

    <p>Theo, do you know what the difficulties I had with the woman
    were when I wrote you last? - her family tried to draw her away
    from me; I have had nothing to do with any of them except the
    mother, because I did not trust them. The more I tried to
    analyze the history of that family, the more I was strengthened
    in that opinion. Now, just because I kept out of their way,
    they plot against me, and so a treacherous attack occurred. I
    told the woman my opinion of their intentions, and said she had
    to choose between her family and me, but that I did not want to
    have anything to do with any of them, primarily because I
    thought that relations with her family would lead her back to
    her former bad life. The family proposed that she, with her
    mother, should keep house for a brother of hers who divorced
    his wife and is rather an infamous scoundrel. The reason why
    the family advised her to leave me was that I earned too
    little, and I was not good to her, and did it only for the
    posing, but would certainly leave her in the lurch. Nota bene,
    she has hardly been able to pose the whole year because of the
    baby. Well, you can judge for yourself just how far these
    suspicions of me have any foundations. But all these things
    were secretly discussed behind my back, and at last the woman
    told me. I said to her, &ldquo;Do just as you like, but I shall
    never leave you unless you turn back to your former
    life.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The worst is, Theo, that if we are hard up now and then,
    they try to upset the woman in that way, and that rascal of a
    brother, for instance, tries to drive her back to her former
    life. Well, I can only say of her that I should think it
    sensible and loyal of her if she broke off all relations with
    her family. I myself dissuade her from going there, but if she
    wants to, I let her go. And the temptation to show off her
    baby, for instance, often drives her back to her family. And
    that influence is fatal, and makes a greater impression upon
    her because it comes from her family, who upset her by saying,
    He will certainly leave you someday. So they try to make her
    leave me.</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, let us work and keep our head clear, and try to
    act rightly! You know how it is with my money; if you can help
    me, do so.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
