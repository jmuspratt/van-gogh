    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>I am sending you some more <art id=912>studies </art>by the same mail. And
    this is a thought which came to me recently:</p>

    <p>If you don't get tired of seeing such sketches, I think it
    would be a good thing to send you, for instance, about sixty
    sketches in a small portfolio. You could look them over in your
    room at your ease, and the advantage would be that against the
    time of your coming here, sooner or later, you would have seen
    some of the things I did last year. Otherwise we should have to
    look them over in such a hurry if you were only here for a
    short time. But if you approve of looking them over beforehand,
    and if I send them now, then I hope I may count on your
    bringing them back with you this summer, for instance, for I
    shall have to work from those studies later on.</p>

    <p>My next work partly depends on keeping the studies together.
    Well, maybe they will amuse you - for instance, perhaps some of
    those old almshouse men are very typical. Well, let me know
    what you think of them.</p>

    <p>As I had to pay some bills after the New Year, I am
    practically already without money now - at least, very little
    is left. You will greatly oblige me if you try to send rather
    before than after the tenth.</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, I hope the sketches will be more or less to your
    liking.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>The drawings I should like to send you are like the figures
    of the lithographs, all kinds of types - men, women,
    children.</p>
