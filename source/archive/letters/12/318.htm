  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and the enclosure. I want to answer
    it at once. What you write may be true - we have already talked
    it over, I often thought so myself - that if the woman were
    obliged to leave me, to shift for herself, she would stay
    straight. But as she has two children, it's a very difficult
    case, but what shall I say? - it is something which she is
    bringing about herself, but which the <i>circumstances bring
    about even more</i>. I underline the latter.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I have done? Today I had a quiet day with
    her. I talked it over with her seriously, explaining to her
    fully what my situation is, that I <i>must</i> go away for my
    work, and <i>must</i> have a year of few expenses and some
    earnings, in order to make up for a past that has been rather
    too much for me. That I foresaw that if I stayed with her, I
    should very soon be unable to help her any more, and should get
    into debt again here, where everything is so expensive, and
    there would be no way out. So that, in short, she and I must be
    wise and separate as friends. That she must get her people to
    take the children, and that she must look for a job.</p>

    <p>And it is so evident that I cannot go on here that even she
    understands it. And as we are both hard up at present, and make
    things worse by staying together, we agreed to separate for a
    time or forever, depending on how things turn out. I add
    &ldquo;or forever,&rdquo; because she has in her children, and
    I in my work, an object to live for, &ldquo;quand bien
    m&ecirc;me,&rdquo; and we shall have to do things against our
    will, and perhaps we shall not be able to be as good as we
    might wish.</p>

    <p>I told her, &ldquo;perhaps you will not be able to stay
    quite straight, but go as straight as possible; I will try to
    do the same, but I know beforehand that my course in life will
    be far from safe.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So I said, &ldquo;As long as I know that you are trying your
    best and are not losing hold of <i>everything</i> and that you
    are good to the children, as you know I have been to them - if
    only you act so that the children always find a mother in you,
    though you are just a poor servant, though you are just a poor
    whore, with all your damned faults, you will always be
    <i>good</i> in my eyes. And though I do not doubt for a moment
    that I have the same kind of faults, I hope I shall not change
    in this respect, that when I see a poor woman with a swollen
    belly, I shall always try to do what I can to help her.&rdquo;
    I said, &ldquo;If you were in the same condition as when I
    found you, well, you would find your home with me - a shelter
    in the storm as long as I have a piece of bread and a roof over
    my head; but now is different, the storm is over, you can go
    straight without me, I think - well, you must try to. For my
    part, I must also try to find a straight path, I must work
    hard; you do the same.&rdquo; That's the way I said it.</p>

    <p>Oh brother, you see how it is, we would not part if we
    didn't have to. I repeat we would not part if we didn't have
    to. Haven't we forgiven each other's faults time after time,
    and made it up again? We know each other so well that we can
    see no evil in each other. Is it love? I do not know, but there
    is something between us that cannot be undone.</p>

    <p>As to what must be done now - you see I do not want to waste
    my time either, I want to work on, straight on, vigorously - as
    to painting, I want to do what must be done. I know that I
    cannot be wrong in this, that is to say, I do not know what the
    result will be for her or for me if I pushed on vigorously, but
    it will certainly turn out better if I cut myself a path alone
    than if we both came to a dead stop by staying together and
    frustrating each other.</p>

    <p>Now to get back to the subject of Drenthe.</p>

    <p>Can you find a way for me to get the money to go there
    alone? Perhaps I could leave the furniture here, renting a
    corner of an attic from my landlord.</p>

    <p>But the sooner the better. I want to be free of that heavy
    rent, you see, and I want to leave here as soon as possible. It
    is necessary for my work. Drenthe, Katwijk, Brabant, never mind
    which, to live with a farmer for a time, far, far away in the
    country - far away, alone with nature.</p>

    <p>And then I must paint a great deal, and be able to spend a
    little more on painting materials.</p>

    <p>I have talked everything over with Van der Weele again. He
    spent an afternoon in the studio, and has seen my studies one
    by one; we have corrected several of them together, so he could
    show me some points of technique.</p>

    <p>Well, he has given me some useful hints. And one of these
    days before I leave, he will again devote some of his time to
    showing me a few things.</p>

    <p>Wisselingh also came to see me one morning. It was very
    pleasant - he said I was more advanced than he expected - we
    lunched together and talked about old times.</p>

    <p>He encouraged me greatly, so did Van der Weele, but the
    painting cannot be avoided. I must - let me say it frankly -
    try to paint a hundred serious studies. You see I must <i>carry
    this through</i>. And those studies must have practical
    subjects too. Characteristic bits of nature. Wisselingh will
    buy something from me some time, perhaps very soon, and we
    agreed that this autumn already, or toward winter, when I have
    been quite in the country for a time, I shall send him
    something, and shall continue to do so, so that he will keep in
    touch with me whether he buys or not.</p>

    <p>I said to him, &ldquo;Write me about what I send you, then I
    will continue in the line you think you can use.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="business.sales">As to C. M., I sent him more than twenty studies, so I think
    he cannot be dissatisfied - besides, he can exchange them for
    others later.</label> As you haven't much to spare yourself, I want to
    suggest that you explain the thing to him - that it would be
    good for me to go to the country to paint on regularly for a
    time. That we shall try to do so without his help, but that it
    would be of such great importance if, in case of need, he did
    not entirely withdraw his help in the future.</p>

    <p>You see, there is no possibility of making both ends meet
    and yet doing what the work demands as to painting. A farmer in
    Drenthe charges a guilder a day for board and lodging. In the
    beginning I should like to keep in touch with the woman as much
    as possible, and send her a little money; but even so the cares
    will be less heavy. The studio must be dispensed with for a
    time, the furniture stored in a corner of a garret until better
    times. And then, without luggage, without company, on the road
    to study. Write me soon what you think of it. I wish you would
    write what you think as soon as you read this letter.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow I will give my landlord notice, and arrange with
    him to store my things here somewhere.</p>

    <p>The woman is going to look for a job. And meanwhile I am
    working as hard as I can. As to my going somewhere else, I
    shall wait for your letter, and then we shall see what we can
    do. I hope it will be a way to overcome the difficulties.
    Adieu, boy, all good wishes, have some luck in business,
    believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
