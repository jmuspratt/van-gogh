  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I received your telegram this morning. I was on the point of
    going to you when I heard you were prevented from coming to me,
    but on thinking it over I gave up the idea, because I thought
    it possible that the doctor thinks speaking might be harmful
    for you, etc.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact I don't think you would raise this
    objection yourself - I myself should not be uneasy about its
    hurting you. In a certain sense there is something peculiar in
    the constitution of every painter. Temporary fits of weakness,
    nervousness, melancholy are often caused by the exertion of
    working; but at the same time there is something like a
    rebound, so that weakness, etc., may be overcome again by
    exertion.</p>

    <p>If one is fed up and sick of arguing and thrashing things
    out with friends, it may do him good to seek solitude for a
    while - but as far as I know this is not the case with you. So
    I thought I would go to you.</p>

    <p>But I thought, Rappard has fathers [sic], mothers [sic],
    sisters, brothers, maidservants and menservants and I don't
    know who else, who might be standing guard to keep him quiet if
    the doctor has ordered such a thing. If one comes at such a
    moment, the gilt is off the gingerbread, and we would both feel
    embarrassed. <label content="health.general">Speaking for myself, I'll tell you frankly that
    sometimes I feel clearly that these two forces of exhaustion
    and reinforcement in my constitution are there through one and
    the same cause - the exertion of working. And I have so much
    faith in this, not only for myself but also for others, that
    last year, for instance, when I was ill, I boldly disregarded
    some of the doctor's advice, not because I thought his advice
    wrong, or because I thought I knew better, but because I
    reasoned like this, &ldquo;Life means painting to me and not so
    much preserving my constitution.&rdquo; Sometimes the
    mysterious words &ldquo;Whosoever shall lose his life shall
    find it&rdquo; are as clear as daylight.</p>

    <p>And the fact is I recovered <i>sooner</i> than some others
    who I know took a long time to recover from the same
    disease.</label></p>

    <p>But, my dear friend, I am writing you what I should
    otherwise have said to you orally - by all means economize your
    strength in this sense, that you do not expend your energy on
    things that do not lead you straight to your goal.</p>

    <p>I say the same about making church ornaments that I say
    about decorations. It is wasting gunpowder and bullets on
    something that may very well be worth a shot fired by someone
    who has a well-filled cartridge box and can fill it again when
    it's empty - but, my dear friend, not a cartridge fired by a
    sharpshooter of the vanguard on whose alertness important
    things may depend, and whose position has laid a greater
    responsibility on his shoulders than on those of others.</p>

    <p>What is permitted to others may be reprehensible in you, le
    mieux en ce cas &eacute;tant l'ennemi du bien [the better being
    in this case the enemy of the good]. Ergo, beware of the
    mieux.</p>

    <p>Do you share my opinion about your responsibility and about
    what depends on your position? - I'm not quite sure. There are
    two viewpoints for everyone: what one is and what one might be.
    In my opinion we must not shut ourselves up in the former with
    a &ldquo;clear&rdquo; conscience. The latter we must consider a
    formidable reality superior to our feelings; for, however
    imperfect and full of faults we may be, we shall never be
    justified in secretly concealing the ideal and all that
    approaches the eternal, as if all that were none of our
    business. For a number of reasons I consider your position very
    important under the present circumstances. Perhaps this makes
    me feel gloomier toward you. I ask myself, &ldquo;What shall I
    do? Whose side is he on?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But now is not exactly the moment to philosophize about
    this. So to come to the point - I am actually very eager to see
    you soon. I have seen absolutely nothing of your work for a
    year - even longer than that, for when you were here last year,
    I didn't see anything either. Besides, you saw only a little of
    my work - only the lithographs.</p>

    <p>So, if you agree, we must try to manage things in such a way
    that we see each other and each other's work, i.e. so that it's
    mutual. So I propose that you let me know when there will be no
    obstacle to prevent me from spending a morning in your studio.
    As long as that symptom of coughing up blood persists, I don't
    think it's exaggerated to raise objections against your coming
    here; so let's agree to postpone this until those symptoms are
    entirely gone. However, please drop me a line the very first
    day you're yourself again, and I'll come to you if it's not
    contrary to the doctor's orders.</p>

    <p>You see I am writing you before receiving the letter which
    you mentioned in your telegram. But I don't suppose your letter
    will greatly alter this plan; perhaps it will even fit in with
    it.</p>

    <p>Don't get the idea that I object to all ornaments and
    decorations - but I object to them <i>at present</i> and under
    the circumstances which confront us in Holland nowadays. I do
    <i>not</i> object to a certain surplus of vigour being wasted
    in this direction during a time of great animation and energy
    and renascence. But I object to it in times when the general
    atmosphere isn't one of animation and energy - especially among
    the younger generation; let the man who has energy concentrate
    - there is a time for gaiety, but also a time for being severe.
    It is really necessary <i>not</i> to share that particular
    feeling of security of those who think all is going well, which
    is the convention nowadays, and which can easily lead to a new
    periwig-and-pigtail era of taking it easy and letting things
    slide.</p>

    <p>When there is decadence - then no ornaments, if you please -
    but a striving after spiritual communion with &ldquo;les vieux
    de la veille&rdquo; [the old ones of yesterday], ignoring the
    present.</p>

    <p>To my mind, my dear friend, there are some things that take
    precedence over private affairs and private difficulties. The
    latter are not really my motive in being eager to speak with
    you. It so happens that I spoke to you about other matters
    before proceeding to thank you for your willingness to help me,
    which is a great relief to me, and will save me from devices
    that are obnoxious to me. <sup>1</sup> I thank you for it. The
    truth is that, generally speaking, I hate it.</p>

    <p>It will be the same when I come to see you. I cannot conceal
    the fact that, speaking for myself, I do not see the future
    very clearly, and that I deem it doubtful whether I shall be
    able to carry out what I intend to do. The fact is that I want
    to consult you in the hope of getting some enlightenment. I
    believe that you have an eye for my work in some way, and in
    some cases your judgment would be very useful to me, for
    instance in helping me to organize the studies I have of a
    certain subject into a definite whole. At the present moment I
    have a <i>lot</i> of studies, and I have in mind a vague
    conception of two or three more imposing compositions, for
    which I shall probably be able to find the greater part of the
    subject matter in my studies.</p>

    <p>Exactly because I value your opinion, it is necessary for
    you to know my thoughts somewhat. And I think that you probably
    have enough imagination to understand my views, even if you
    should not agree with me in all matters.</p>

    <p>If I object to a certain new style, this certainly does not
    refer to the style of Isra&euml;ls, Mauve, Maris - no. No! This
    is the best style, in my opinion, but something has resulted
    from it recently which - though there seems to be a resemblance
    - is in utter contradiction to the style of these masters, and
    that is what I disapprove of. Van der Weele, for instance, is
    more serious and keeps to the straight path. I saw his studies
    last Sunday.</p>

    <p>Now I believe that the path you are following is straight
    too, but I'm not sure that certain things are not divergences
    in the direction I mentioned just now. I am quite willing to
    take this opinion back - but it is my impression. Well, I for
    my part am also trying to find the path I think best, let's say
    the path of Isra&euml;ls, Mauve, Maris - I have no idea how far
    I have progressed on it - and know even less how far I shall
    progress on it - but I have done my best and shall go on doing
    my best. And this being so, it is as far from my intention as
    the north is from the south to object to your decorations in
    the manner or the tone of a schoolmaster; but, on the contrary,
    I do so as one who is himself seeking after something true and
    sound - and serious - not because I have found it already, but
    serious because I am searching for it myself too.</p>

    <p>And all that I think about you, but certainly no less about
    myself, is that we must beware of being diffuse, and that we
    must seek concentration and terseness. When I come to see you,
    it will, before God, be to talk over practical things with you,
    and not theory or philosophy. For the sake of practice, as
    prosaic as a Monday morning.</p>

    <p>You write about a beautiful sheet in the Graphic by Howard
    Pyle. If you mean a composition that reminds one of Terborch or
    Nicolaas Keyzer - &ldquo;Penn and the Colonists&rdquo; - yes, I
    was struck by it too, so much so that I have ordered the issue.
    Yes, it is a damned fine thing. I bought an issue of the London
    News for the same reason, because of a sheet by King -
    &ldquo;Workmen in a Carriage of the Underground
    Railway.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I have also subscribed to Le Salon 1883 by Dumas, of which
    the first issue has now been published at 1 franc, and which
    will be complete in twelve issues.</p>

    <p>I am very sorry you did not come after all, but that is not
    your fault. I have had some scruples up to now about going to
    you, because so many would rather have my room than my company,
    and also because I think visiting an unpleasant chore in
    general. And here in The Hague this is partly because I have
    taken the woman and her two children into my house, and they
    think that for decency's sake they must not associate with me
    at all. But having heard from yourself your conditional
    opinion, which is so different from the behavior of others, I
    think I can drop my scruples.</p>

    <p>I act in this way: if anybody avoids me on account of this,
    I do not seek his company; I prefer staying away somewhere to
    not being welcome. The more so because I can make allowances a
    little, a very little, just a tiny wee little bit, for the
    prejudice of those who consider, or try to consider, only the
    social conventions, for which reason I leave them alone,
    especially as I look upon it as a weakness, so that I won't
    fight them, or at least I won't attack them. Acting thus, I
    certainly do save cartridges. Do you think this conceited?</p>

    <p>Take me as you find me, and so let's agree that I shall hear
    from you as to when I may come to see you without going
    contrary to the doctor's orders.</p>

    <p>And thanks again for your willingness to help me, and your
    letter will be welcome when it arrives, but if your condition
    makes it advisable for you to postpone writing, by all means do
    so.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake in thought.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I just can't believe that a painter should have no other
    task and no other duty than painting only. What I mean to say
    is, whereas many consider, for instance, reading books and such
    things that they call a waste of time, on the contrary, I am of
    the opinion that, far from causing one to work less or less
    well, rather it makes one work more and better to try to
    broaden one's mind in a field that is so closely allied with
    this work - and that at any rate it is a matter of importance,
    which greatly influences one's work, from whatever point of
    view one looks at things, and whatever conception one may have
    of life.</p>

    <p>I believe that the more one loves, the more one will act;
    for love that is only a feeling I would never recognize as
    love.</p>

    <p>Well, I hope that this batch of wood engravings will please
    you.</p>

    <p>Please return the things you already have sometime; then I
    will give them to Van der Weele. I have selected them as
    carefully as possible, and as far as I know these are all the
    duplicates I have. There are also a few French ones among
    them.</p>

    <p>We can check the rest whenever you come here. Then too you
    will be able to see a lot of sheets of which I have, alas, no
    duplicates.</p>

    <p>I wish you joy with them - and write again soon.</p>
