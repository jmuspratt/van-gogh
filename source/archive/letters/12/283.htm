    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I suppose you will be busy for the Salon - I saved up a
    stamp on purpose, to be able to write to you once more.</p>

    <p>I have written to friend Rappard, but of course no answer as
    yet; in ordinary cases he sometimes waits a month before he
    answers.</p>

    <p>If you are strained yourself, send me less than usual if it
    must be; but send it as soon as possible. For next week I have
    an arrangement with Van der Weele to go and <i>paint</i> in the
    dunes - he will show me a few things which I do not know
    yet.</p>

    <p>I have been working in the dunes for some days, but I long
    for a model: otherwise I cannot go on.</p>

    <p>In short, I feel rather worried. So write as soon as
    possible. As for the work, I am getting on pretty well, and I
    think you would like some of the drawings I have on hand
    now.</p>

    <p>I wish you might have some good luck, boy, for I know you
    are having a hard time too. Best wishes, adieu, I must set to
    work - out-of-doors.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I shall soon write you at greater length about some things.
    There seems to be something the matter with the woman in regard
    to what I told you about her mother; perhaps it is nothing. I
    do not know what it is myself, but it is another thing that
    worries me. Write soon, boy, for it is very unpleasant to be
    without a cent. It makes trifles take on the biggest
    proportions.</p>
  </body>
