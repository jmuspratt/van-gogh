    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I just received a letter from home (thank Father for it,
    please - I hadn't received the letter when I wrote,) and I see
    you intend to leave Breda 2:15 Friday. Please let me know if
    you change your plans, for I want to come and meet you at the
    station. If you are in no hurry, we must make the most of the
    time we can be together. I am working on a painted study for
    the potato diggers. I hope it will turn out well [F 009, JH
    385].</p>

    <p>I along very much for your coming; have a good time. A
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Do look at what's going on in the fields in Brabant, and try
    to get a glimpse of a weaver's interior in the village - they
    are so picturesque.</p>
