  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>While I think of it, I must tell you once more that what you
    say about &ldquo;like a meek dove&rdquo; (a period like
    Correggio painted) is true, it does not last, and it is right
    that it does not last. It is also right that we see it and that
    we experience it and shall not forget it; but it does not last,
    because that poignant feeling (though I believe it remains
    deeply hidden in man) is changed into a more normal condition -
    so, for instance the woman here now looks much more like a
    mother hen fussing over her chickens. But a mother hen is a
    pretty animal for all that.</p>

    <p>This morning I was in a charitable home, boy, to see a
    little old woman (with whom I had to arrange about posing), and
    thus far she has brought up two natural children of her
    daughter's who is a so-called kept woman. Several things struck
    me: in the first place, the neglected appearance of the poor
    little creatures, though the grandmother does her best, and
    many are much worse off; and secondly, I was deeply touched by
    the devotion of that little grandmother, and it struck me that
    when an old woman puts her wrinkled hands to such a task, we
    men must not let ours be idle.</p>

    <p>I saw the real mother, who just dropped in, wearing untidy
    clothes, with uncombed, unkempt hair. And, boy, I thought of
    the difference between the woman with whom I live as she is now
    and as I found her a year ago, and between the children here
    and there.</p>

    <p>Oh, if only one keeps reality in mind, then it is as clear
    as daylight that it is a good thing to take care of what would
    otherwise wither and droop. And I personally think that no
    argument about the objections to or the impropriety of meddling
    can counter the reality of these things. And in my case, just
    because it fits in with my profession, many difficulties
    disappear, though from another side, the financial one, many
    difficulties do indeed arise, and will remain. But here also it
    sometimes happens that the poor are the poor man's friend, and
    certainly it is a good thing that women and children learn
    thrift and that men learn to work hard.</p>

    <p>But as for you, there are things which I foresee you will
    have to contend with, like everybody else - things of another
    nature, which occur in all men's lives, for that matter. I
    mean, you should thoroughly prepare yourself for the fact that
    you will gradually discover quite different things in the woman
    whom you are taking care of - that is in her character. And
    speaking my mind unreservedly, I say you will be disappointed
    in her, and perhaps you will say to her, &ldquo;How you have
    changed!&rdquo; and she will say the same thing to you. And
    then I think it will mean a step in the right direction if -
    notwithstanding this &ldquo;change&rdquo; on both sides -
    <i>neither of you</i> is annoyed with the other, and <i>you</i>
    learn to put up with things on <i>her</i> part, and <i>she</i>
    learns to put up with things on <i>your</i> part - or, in other
    words, if there is a mutual overlooking of shortcomings.</p>

    <p>Look, this is a crisis nobody can escape, and it is a crisis
    which may cause some to become more firmly attached to each
    other, whereas on the other hand, it may cause others to become
    estranged by it, which is always a very deplorable thing to
    have happen once one has started. In short, <i>sticking it
    out</i> is not always an easy thing to do.</p>

    <p>And here in my case, for instance, in <i>those</i> days I
    was very glad now and then that there were <i>children</i> for
    whose sake the path of duty was more clearly discernible. To
    the woman as well as to myself.</p>

    <p>Look, man has no stauncher friend than his
    <i>duty,</i> and though at times it may be a rough and
    stern taskmaster, as long as one works <i>in its
    service,</i> one will not easily become a bankrupt.</p>

    <p>And when I say I foresee you will have conflicts, perhaps
    more than the usual number of conflicts, I base this
    supposition on the fact that probably this woman may also be of
    a humbler station in life, as it's called. And what Father says
    about this, for instance - you know his way of thinking
    sufficiently for me not to need to repeat it - is really true,
    at least in certain respects I admit it. Only there are certain
    cases, like yours, in which the important thing is to save a
    life - look, in such cases Father himself would not know what
    to do, or rather, I actually believe that in his heart too
    &ldquo;je v&ocirc;te pour la vie&rdquo; would carry the day.
    Ah! you know, once in a while <i>when</i> I am in doubt, I ask
    myself, Would you be a <i>judge</i> passing a death sentence?
    And every time I find only <i>one</i> answer: No, once and for
    all, I am for abolishing death sentences, legal or otherwise,
    ostracism and other peines capitales. We are called on to
    <i>preserve</i> life, to respect life; that is our duty, and we
    can always justify it - even if the world puts us in the wrong
    and things do not turn out to our advantage.</p>

    <p>So you see, old fellow, this letter is meant to tell you
    that you not only have my sympathy if things turn out
    <i>well</i>, but also in case they turn out <i>badly</i>.</p>

    <p>And as for me, you must not infer from this letter that
    things turned out badly in my case, for I have much to be
    thankful for; but notwithstanding this, petites mis&egrave;res
    of various kinds have befallen me, and the
    &ldquo;precariousness&rdquo; of such situations is so clear to
    me that, seeing it is only the beginning for you, <label content="Theo.mistress">I wanted to
    tell you once and for all that in my opinion it is <i>right
    to</i> try to save the life of such an unknown woman, even if
    one does not know beforehand how this woman will turn out
    later, nor what she will prove to be. And in no event shall I
    be among those who say, &rdquo;You never should have let
    yourself in for it,&rdquo; for it stands to reason that
    <i>this</i> will be the general opinion if it <i>should
    happen</i> that things do <i>not</i> turn out well.</label></p>

    <p>Further, this letter is meant to tell you that I think it
    <i>desirable</i> that there be a child, for you will see that
    most people consider this a difficulty, which I do <i>not</i>
    see, just the reverse. And I assure you, I expect everything
    can be arranged so that you will not be compromised in the eyes
    of the world; but suppose things came to such a pass that you
    had to choose between compromising yourself and deserting her -
    in that case I should approve of you if you said, I vote for
    life, and when it is a case of saving a human life, I scorn a
    compromise. This is if the worst comes to the worst, but as
    long as you are able to live in peace with everybody without
    harming her - do so. Well, it is not superfluous to say so,
    taking into account that Father, for instance, said to me at
    the time, &ldquo;There is something immoral in a liaison with a
    woman of a lower station in life&rdquo; (which I do not think
    true, as I do not see any <i>connection</i> between the station
    in life and morality: the station in life concerns the world,
    morality concerns God), and further, &ldquo;Do not sacrifice
    your position to a woman,&rdquo; which I do not think applies
    when a human life is at stake.</p>

    <p>But Father himself is not such a die-hard, and often he is
    quite reasonable.</p>

    <p>As to the possibility of certain persons turning against you
    because of the woman, I do not think you will regret going in
    for a permanent relationship, in which I differ radically from
    those who as a matter of principle only enter into
    relationships &ldquo;without consequences.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>One finds great inner calm in a permanent relationship, and
    I think it in harmony with nature; whereas one transgresses the
    eternal moral laws as soon as one tries to shirk the
    consequences of a relationship with a woman. My opinion is that
    a man who regulates his life in harmony with the eternal laws
    of nature as well as of morality contributes his share toward
    the reform and progress and amelioration of things which have
    become disorientated in present-day society. Therefore, do not
    doubt the reasonableness of your act; you cannot be too calm
    and imperturbable in the face of people's cynical remarks. A
    permanent relationship often is a source of rejuvenation of
    vigor and enterprise. One may lose protection, but one gains
    energy and keeps on one's feet, after all.</p>

    <p>But do you know what is a danger, which I realize now more
    than I used to?</p>

    <p>With reference to your ideas about things, you are concerned
    not only with yourself, but also with the views of the woman
    you are with. And just when you are firm and unshakable in the
    face of outward influences, it may happen that in certain
    respects the woman will let herself be disconcerted by the
    opposition of certain people. And will start opposing you in
    the same way as the people I mentioned, and will say, It won't
    do, it's impossible - and that, at a time when you are already
    victorious, so to speak.</p>

    <p>Well, the woman may change a great deal in consequence of
    the shocks she has had to undergo and may stand by you; she may
    turn out a success or a failure according to the way she reacts
    to things, she may improve or deteriorate in character by
    rowing against the stream.</p>

    <p>And retrogression is part of the female character.</p>

    <p>But as there are qualities in your woman which indicate that
    there is something intellectual about her, and as she is not
    without culture, I think that for this reason she doubly
    deserves your confidence.</p>

    <p>If it should be that her intellectual development is coupled
    with contentedness, and she is modest in her demands, I do not
    think the above-mentioned things are to be feared. And being
    equal to a period of rowing against the stream, she can only
    gain energy. Therefore be of good heart.</p>

    <p>And with regard to my finances, know it well that whatever
    you can spare is as absolutely necessary to me as the air I
    breathe, and that my productivity depends on it, but I don't
    think you need be afraid of taking any steps toward
    recommending my work, for it will not be a failure; I think I
    can assure you we will find friends for it. And for my part, in
    order to lighten the burden for you, though apart from that I
    assure you I did not like it at all, I wrote to C. M., and I
    want to ask you: could <i>you</i> perhaps write a little word
    to Tersteeg, telling him that I am working on those large
    drawings? Look here, boy, if Mauve gave a helping hand
    <i>now</i>, for instance, perhaps, perhaps they might be
    turned into paintings. I think the studies and compositions are
    worked out enough to serve as a foundation for a painted
    picture. If I had the means, I would not care to sell these at
    all, and I should keep my work together till it formed a good
    whole.</p>

    <p>And know that I long terribly for your coming. I think you
    will see, brother, that your faithful help and your sacrifices
    for me have borne some fruit, and will bear even more. But I am
    greatly in need of money for the expenses. And even if we don't
    sell these, I think they might become the means of finding new
    connections, and perhaps of re-establishing relations with C.
    M. or Tersteeg or Mauve.</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, a warm handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Written on a loose leaf] I should think it all the more
    desirable if you could send me something extra because, instead
    of doing less, I should like to do more during the days between
    now and your arrival.</p>

    <p>I hope I shall be able to push things forward a little more,
    because I am now getting results with lithographic crayon, and
    turn out things that are better and more vigorous than the
    former drawings. Only a few more pulls, and I think they may be
    able and willing to use me for some illustration work or
    other.</p>

    <p>For although this may seem of little account, I am fitted by
    nature for such a position, and I feel the inclination and the
    energy for it.</p>

    <p>And also, I should like so very much to wash on Torchon
    again, probably before your arrival too. For you must not
    suppose that I have dismissed the idea of doing watercolours or
    painting. I am most firmly resolved to do it, only drawing is
    the root of everything, and the time spent on it is really
    wholly profitable.</p>

    <p>One cannot help drawing &ldquo;pictures of the future&rdquo;
    in one's mind. One does this even if one is convinced one
    cannot predict anything with certainty and sufficient accuracy.
    But what you write today may have a great influence on my
    future. Who knows if it might not end in our being drawn
    together even more closely.</p>

    <p>Well, at all events your coming here has become doubly
    important to me on account of this, and I want to try to give
    myself a few more pulls in the right direction; help me do it
    if you can.</p>

    <p>If at some time or other you should get more of a home life,
    I think we should understand each other even better, and I have
    the impression we should mean even more to each other.</p>

    <p>I understand it is probable that you are going to have many
    cares, and if I can do anything to produce better work, I shall
    exert myself doubly.</p>

    <p>At times a blessing may rest on love, though the world seems
    to think one ought to doubt this. But the blessing is rooted in
    the fact that if one works with love in one's heart, one can do
    more than otherwise, and is afraid of fewer things. And
    consequently one has more serenity. In short, one learns to
    persevere. And, my dear fellow, however all this may be -
    whether socially speaking it will be to your advantage or not -
    I believe that after all you can only gain by it. Therefore a
    blessing on everything you do, and be assured of my heartfelt
    wish that the woman you are taking care of may recover and be
    saved.</p>

    <p>Yes, it certainly is inspiring work - saving a life from
    drowning in a sea of misery! It may well be that it is a great
    happiness for you as well as for her. For then hidden forces of
    energy and vitality will develop. Once more, thanks for your
    letter and the remittance. And if you can, write again
    soon.</p>
