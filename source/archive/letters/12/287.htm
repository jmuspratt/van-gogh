  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>This week I have been working hard on a large drawing which
    I sent you a little sketch of.</p>

    <p>When I was with Rappard, he said, &ldquo;Those very first
    drawings of yours were good after all; you ought to make some
    again in the same way.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Do you remember that in the very beginning I sent you some
    sketches, &ldquo;Winter Tale,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shadows
    Passing,&rdquo; etc.? <i>You</i> said at the time that the
    action of the figures was not well enough expressed, do you
    remember? That was quite true, but now for several years I have
    drudged exclusively on the figure to get some action and
    structure into it. And because of that very drudgery I had
    somehow lost the strong desire to compose and to let the
    imagination work.</p>

    <p>When Rappard spoke with a certain warmth about that very
    first time, it awoke again. Now, superficial though this little
    sketch may be, I think you will find something of that very
    first sentiment back in it, but now with more action.</p>

    <p>These are<art id=1030> &ldquo;Peat Cutters&rdquo; in the dunes</art> - the
    <art id=1031>original drawing</art> is about one meter by half a meter.</p>

    <p>It is a splendid bit of scenery from which one can draw an
    infinite number of subjects. I have been there very often
    recently, and made all kinds of studies of it. Rappard saw
    them, but when he was here, we did not yet know how to put them
    together. I have figured out this composition since then. And
    once I had, it came off pretty well, and at four o'clock in the
    morning I was already at work on it in my garret.</p>

    <p>Having started composing once again, I intend to go on with
    it and to carry out some which I have in my head and for which
    I have already made the studies. I have made preparations for
    it by ordering some stretchers and also a large wooden frame to
    be able to work in the frame and shut it off. I
    hope that when this is finished, you will not mind taking it
    with you some day to show to the illustration people, and that
    such a thing will please you more than those single
    studies.</p>

    <p>But I can't tell beforehand, and we shall see how it is when
    you come. But, boy, I am so glad that I have been able to start
    this before you come. We can <i>speak better</i> about the
    future now.</p>

    <p>I want so much to make something comforting, something that
    makes one think.</p>

    <p>You know that one of the pictures I think most beautiful of
    all is &ldquo;The Walk on the Ramparts&rdquo; by Leys. That
    style, however, is not the fashion nowadays, but the sentiment
    in it has something eternal; one may have different conceptions
    of reality, of nature, and yet find again, even now, what was
    more generally sought after and felt in Leys's time than now.
    But it demands continuous effort to express what one feels and
    to get it into shape.</p>

    <p>I cannot tell you how that visit to Rappard has cheered me;
    I like his work so much, and when I was with him, he said it
    had also done him good to be with me. By talking together, we
    have got new ideas.</p>

    <p>I wish you could meet Rappard again when you come to
    Holland. I think in his studio, as well as in mine, you would
    get an impression more reminiscent of what one used to see in
    the studios than of what one sees at present.</p>

    <p>Yet I think it will have your sympathy.</p>

    <p>Right now Rappard is working on a kind of smithy, and last
    winter he painted &ldquo;The Asylum for the Blind&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;The Tile Painters.&rdquo; All of them have style and are
    serious and original, I think.</p>

    <p>You understand all this causes me many expenses. Without the
    money I got from Rappard, I should not have been able to
    undertake this.</p>

    <p>And though I have studies for it, I still need models
    continually, and the progress depends on whether I have money
    to pay them.</p>

    <p>I have a few more in mind, but I'm getting short of money
    again.</p>

    <p>You see, whenever I have a bit of luck, I immediately make
    use of it to undertake a thing that would otherwise have
    miscarried.</p>

    <p>So whenever you can spare it, do send me something extra if
    possible.</p>

    <p>This &ldquo;Peat Cutters&rdquo; is quite different from
    &ldquo;Le Paradou,&rdquo; but I assure you I also feel for
    &ldquo;Le Paradou.&rdquo; Who knows, someday I may attack such
    a Paradou subject.</p>

    <p>Write soon if you haven't written already.</p>

    <p>When you see the drawing, I don't think you will find it too
    large. The proportions of the figures is such that one can put
    some vigour into them, and each of them demands a special
    study. I have studies for all the figures that appear in it. I
    made this drawing with charcoal and crayon and printer's
    ink.</p>

    <p>Well, good luck and write soon. A few days ago I was with
    Van der Weele in the dunes. There we found a spot where they
    were digging sand from the dunes, a splendid thing with diggers
    and wheelbarrows.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p><?showImage("341_V-T_2870");?>
     Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
