  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Since I received your letter, what you wrote has literally
    filled all my thoughts. And I write once more because I am so
    full of it. In cases like this one is involved with a patient
    who is ill in body <i>and</i> in soul, so it is doubly serious;
    and financial help for the necessities of life is not enough to
    bring about complete recovery - the best and most efficacious
    remedy is love and a home. At least I felt this way last
    winter, and since then - now, for instance, I feel it even
    more, just because experience taught me what sentiment had
    already told me. To save a life is a great and beautiful thing,
    but it is also very difficult and requires great care.</p>

    <p>To make a home for the homeless, yes, it must be a good
    thing, whatever the world may say, it <i>cannot</i> be wrong,
    and yet it is often considered a crime.</p>

    <p>Involuntarily I have thought it over and said to myself -
    What will people say about it? Will it bring you into conflict
    with the world? This is also a question in my mind which I
    cannot answer, as I do not know enough about the circumstances
    yet. And there is another thing which is the real motive for
    this letter, which I want you to consider - though perhaps it
    has already occurred to you.</p>

    <p>A thing like this takes a long time - of course I think it
    possible that you will soon see the effects of your good care,
    but the complete recovery in body and soul of such a severely
    tried constitution will take years. At this moment the woman
    and the children are sitting with me. When I think of last
    year, there is a great difference. The woman is stronger and
    stouter, has lost very, very much of her agitated air; the baby
    is the prettiest, healthiest, merriest little fellow you can
    imagine - he crows like a cock, and is fat and chubby even
    though he gets nothing but the breast.</p>

    <p>And the <art id=1007>poor little girl,</art> you see from the drawing that the
    old deep misery has not been erased, and I often feel anxious
    about her, but still she is quite different from last year;
    then it was very, very bad, <art id=1008>now she already is looking more
    childlike.</art></p>

    <p>Well, though not exactly entirely normal, the situation is
    much better than I dared to hope last year. And when I think it
    over, would it have been better if the mother had had a
    miscarriage or if the baby had withered or pined away through
    lack of milk, if the little girl had become more and more dirty
    and neglected, and the woman herself had sunk into an almost
    indescribably miserable condition? -</p>

    <p>Well, when I see all this, I cannot doubt any more, and I
    say, Forward, full of good courage. Something simple, really
    motherly, shows itself in the woman - and as this gets
    stronger, she is saved. And how is this progress brought
    about??? Not by physicians, nor by extraordinary measures. By
    having the feeling of a home of her own, by a regular useful
    life. Not by sparing herself too much, for she <i>cannot</i> do
    that, but because the anxious heart finds more rest now, even
    under hard and tiresome work. With this thoroughly familiar
    case in front of my eyes, I come back to what I want to say, It
    seems to me that if you want to see good results, you must pay
    special attention to the surroundings of the woman whom you
    write about. It would be desirable for her to be elsewhere than
    in a dreary hotel room - she ought to have more home-like
    surroundings. You must consider this, for I think it's
    important; she must be diverted by very ordinary commonplace
    things which keep her occupied. Not isolated in a room, without
    intercourse with people - for her own good, and not because you
    want to keep her in the background or hide her. But it is
    necessary for her to avoid emotion and shocks as much as
    possible, and the sooner she returns to ordinary everyday
    activities and surroundings, the better.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">Certainly, if you could take her into your house at once - I
    should not mention it. But I am afraid it is impossible, and
    you yourself could not approve of doing so all at once.</label></p>

    <p>Loneliness or idleness is fatal; she must have a chance to
    talk with good people. I think that it would be delightful for
    her to be in a homelike atmosphere - for instance, if she could
    occupy herself with children. I think it rather a pity she has
    no child. I think it makes the case even more critical. Yes, in
    my opinion the most practical thing you can do is bring her
    into some homelike atmosphere. I think that your main thought
    at present is - This life must be saved - and that you
    unselfishly think more of her than of yourself.</p>

    <p>Last year I could think of only one home for her, namely my
    own, and had I been able to act differently, I shouldn't have
    taken the woman into my house at once, in order to avoid the
    difficulties which could not be avoided now. But it's different
    with you, and perhaps you can temporarily take her (namely, the
    person whom you write about) somewhere where she is safe and
    quiet, till she has completely recovered. I am afraid her
    recovery will take a long time - besides, one need not trespass
    against the world's prejudices <i>if it can be
    avoided</i>. <i>If it cannot be avoided</i>, one
    should do what one knows is right: last summer I should have
    sinned against all possible prejudices - whatever their number
    - rather than leave the woman without home or shelter. But in
    your case I think it can and must be done more discreetly, and
    if I were you, I should try to find a suitable home for her -
    not leave her alone in a room without intercourse with people -
    for her own good, the sooner she gets normal, ordinary
    activities and surroundings, the better.</p>

    <p>My heart is full, and I think of you all the time; just now
    I made another drawing for which the woman posed.</p>

    <p>I can tell you, boy, my experience of this year is that
    though there are hard, very hard moments of care and
    difficulty, it is infinitely better to live with wife and
    children than without - but it is always wiser to get to know
    each other first, it is more sensible and prudent. And I should
    have done the same if it could have been arranged, but there
    was no other home for her than mine. Well, one has to take the
    circumstances into account, and sometimes giving offence cannot
    be avoided. So I do not in the least want to advise you to give
    it up, but I do think we agree that it is better to be cautious
    with reference to the world, otherwise it may spoil things. So
    be careful. For the moment the recovery is the main thing, and
    the rest will follow.</p>

    <p>Wouldn't there be some one of your friends who would be
    willing to assist you and take her into his house for a
    time?</p>

    <p>Perhaps a kind of hospital would be preferable - the
    ordinary or a private one, where she could have company.
    Perhaps all this is already settled, and I write about it just
    because I do not know anything definite. So if you should stick
    to your opinion that this person is the woman whom you want to
    devote your life to, I consider it a fortunate thing for you.
    And then it will be precisely this constant love which will
    make her bloom again.</p>

    <p>I wish I knew when you were coming - if possible, bring the
    old studies with you. As to what I wrote you about sending me a
    little more money - yes, I am rather hard up and wish it were
    possible, but do not deprive her for my sake, and know well
    that because of what you wrote, I will try twice as hard to
    make progress, so that the burden may become somewhat lighter
    for you. But the difficulty is that hard work costs more money
    because of the greater outlay.</p>

    <p>Write soon, for I long to hear from you. Rappard is
    recovering; I had a letter from him. I am very hard at work,
    always at all kinds of heads. Adieu. A handshake in
    thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
