  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>This morning a man came who had repaired a lamp for me three
    weeks ago, and from whom I bought some crockery at the same
    time, which he forced upon me.</p>

    <p>He came to make a row because I had just paid his neighbor
    and not him, and accompanied it with the customary cursing,
    noise, invectives, etc. I told him that I would pay him as soon
    as I received money but that for the moment l was absolutely
    without a cent, but that was just pouring oil on the fire. I
    begged him to leave the house, and at last I pushed him out the
    door; but he, perhaps having waited for this, seized me by the
    neck, threw me against the wall, and then flat on the
    floor.</p>

    <p>Now you see, this is the kind of small misery one has to
    face. Such a fellow is stronger than I, of course - he is not
    afraid. All the small tradesmen one has to deal with daily are
    of that same kind. They come of their own accord to ask you to
    buy from them, and want to have you for a customer, but if by
    chance the payment has to be put off for more than a week, they
    come to curse and make a row. Well, they are as they are, what
    can one expect? - they are sometimes hard up themselves. I am
    telling you this to show you that it is indeed urgent for me to
    make some money.</p>

    <p>When I went to Scheveningen, I had to leave some people
    waiting for their money. I am rather harassed, brother, there
    is so much worry and care. I long for your coming, because I
    should like to settle the question of moving. To keep things
    going here, I ought to earn a little more. Life is impossible
    here, because of the little that's lacking.</p>

    <p>As far as my work goes, I am not unlucky, because all these
    little miseries do not affect my energy and do not prevent my
    making a few more things. I left two small marines at De
    Bock's, one with a stormy sea, one with a calm one. I should
    love to go on with that kind of thing. Yesterday I painted a
    farm with a red roof under high trees. I think painting figure
    studies would help me in a great many ways. I started one of a
    boy in a potato field, and one in the garden near a fence of
    plaited rushes. I ought to be able to work at it with all my
    might. This morning's incident indicated clearly that it is my
    duty to find a way to go and live in a smaller house in the
    country, since it is impossible for me to earn a little more
    here. On the other hand the studio here is comfortable enough,
    and there is no lack of beautiful things to paint. The sea is
    another thing one does not find everywhere.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.neurological">What I told you about my feeling rather weak is true. It has
    now settled into a pain between the shoulders and in the lumbar
    vertebrae, which I've already had at times, but I know from
    experience that one ought to be careful then, otherwise one
    becomes too weak and can't get over it so easily.</label></p>

    <p>To a certain extent I let things take their own course.
    Things have been too much for me lately, and my plan to regain
    former friends by working sensibly and hard has fallen to
    pieces.</p>

    <p>Theo, there is one thing we must settle - I don't mean that
    it will happen immediately, but the days might become even
    gloomier, and in that case I should like to make an
    arrangement.</p>

    <p>My studies and all the work that is in the studio are
    absolutely your property. I repeat, at present there is no
    question of it - but it might happen - for instance because of
    my not paying the taxes - that they sold my things; but in that
    case I should like to bring my work safely out of the house.
    It's my studies, which I need for my later work, things which
    I've taken a lot of trouble to make.</p>

    <p>Up to now no one on this street has paid taxes, though they
    are all down for various sums.</p>

    <p>So am I, and twice the assessors have come to the house; but
    I showed them my four kitchen chairs and rough deal table, and
    told them that I could not be counted among those who ought to
    be taxed so high. If they found rugs, pianos, antiques in a
    painter's house, perhaps they were not wrong in putting such a
    man down for a high tax; but as for me, I couldn't even pay for
    my colours and had no articles de luxe but children in the
    house, so there was nothing to be got from me.</p>

    <p>Then they sent me assessments and summonses, but I didn't
    pay the slightest attention, and once when they came to ask
    about them, I said it was simply no use, I'd lit my pipe with
    them. That I didn't have the money, and that my four chairs and
    table wouldn't bring anything - that even new, they weren't
    worth what they had assessed me for.</p>

    <p>Since then, they have already left me alone for several
    months, and others here on the street haven't paid anything
    either.</p>

    <p>But now that we mention it, in such a case, I wish I knew
    where to store my studies. Perhaps I could take them to Van der
    Weele's. And my painting materials too. I always feel a certain
    hope that when you come to the studio, you will find things
    that might appeal to somebody, though they may have no fixed
    market value. It's not my work that's the cause of the
    trouble.</p>

    <p>After all, I don't feel discouraged at heart. On the
    contrary, I agree with what I recently read in Zola: &ldquo;Si
    &agrave; pr&eacute;sent je vaux quelque chose c'est que je suis
    seul et que je hais les niais, les impuissants, les cyniques,
    les railleurs idiots et b&ecirc;tes.&rdquo; [If at present I am
    worth something, it is because I am alone, and I hate the
    fatuous-minded, the impotent, the cynics, the idiotic and
    stupid scoffers.] But for all that, perhaps I should not be
    able to withstand the siege if I stayed here. I write about it
    because it's only the beginning, and the device of going and
    living more cheaply may bring relief - it is already decidedly
    urgent just to lower the rent.</p>

    <p>Van der Weele has got the silver medal for his picture,
    which he richly deserves. I am glad he has it.</p>

    <p>I have thought a great deal about that picture of Van der
    Weele's because I have seen it in various stages, and I have
    talked it over with him, and I liked it at once. I think, Theo,
    that if I can work on regularly and calmly, I, too, shall be
    able to make something of the kind in the future.</p>

    <p>But at all events first I should have to go through a period
    of assiduous painting, and I must have the means for that which
    as yet I can't figure out how to get. Van der Weele has got the
    means by sacrificing half his time to things which he does not
    do for pleasure, but they keep his paintbox filled, and his
    larder, etc. Perhaps, perhaps, if something might come into my
    work which people would care to buy, I could manage too. I
    shouldn't care so much about the selling itself - if it weren't
    for being able to go on; I tell you frankly that out of all the
    ideas about art which I picked up during that period at
    Goupil's - though my taste hasn't changed - very few have stood
    the test when put into practice. Things are not made the way
    the art dealer thinks they are, and a painter's life is
    different, the study is different.</p>

    <p>I can't explain it exactly, but Daubigny's saying, &ldquo;Ce
    ne sont pas mes tableaux que j'estime davantage, qui me
    rapportent le plus&rdquo; [Those of my pictures that I
    appreciate the most do not bring the most], is something which
    I believe now; but if I had heard it when at Goupil and Co., I
    would have thought that he only said it &ldquo;par
    mani&egrave;re de dire.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, I am in rather a tough spot. You can see from
    what I told you about this morning's skirmish that people are
    very inconsiderate of me. They would probably stay more at a
    distance if one wore a top hat and the like. After all, one has
    self-respect, and such things are not pleasant. Well, I wish my
    work could bring some profit. Adieu, write soon, I long so much
    for your letters.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>The future would seem brighter if I were less awkward in my
    dealings with people. Without you, finding buyers for my work
    would be almost impossible; with you, it will eventually be
    possible. And if we do our utmost, it will stand firm and not
    perish. But we must stick together.</p>

    <p>For my part, I have a great longing to see you and to talk
    the work over. Occasionally I talk with De Bock and other
    painters, but I don't take them into my confidence, and they
    needn't know everything.</p>

    <p>Of course I don't mind things like this morning's little
    incident, but so many disagreeable things coming from the
    outside make one feel the need of just forgetting everything by
    talking with somebody who fully understands and sympathizes.
    Usually I keep things to myself, and try to fight it out alone.
    But that's not sufficient for a man of feeling, and one tries
    to find true friendship and confidence. Just because at times I
    feel my health failing and the strength to bear things
    dwindling, I tell you frankly that I'm sorely in need of having
    a quiet talk with you, and of seeing you again.</p>

    <p>Keeping the studio going this year has been quite a
    struggle. Sometimes it has been awfully hard to go on with the
    work. And I must try to renew my strength.</p>

    <p>And in the time which must elapse before we see each other
    again - do write a little oftener if you can, that must be
    possible. <label content="health.fatigue">I must go on with my work, but a feeling of
    prostration overwhelms me again and again - a general
    faintness, a reaction after exertion, which keeps returning,
    and which I must try to overcome, otherwise it will get
    worse.</label></p>

    <p>I wouldn't say this to De Bock or anyone - but I trust you
    enough to tell you, it isn't a question of losing courage or
    giving up, but of having spent more strength than could be
    spared, and of being more or less exhausted. All in all, the
    main thing is that a good understanding remains between us and
    that we keep our friendship warm. If bad luck comes, we'll
    brave it, but, brother, let's stick faithfully together. I am
    the gainer in all respects, for without you I shouldn't have
    been able to get as far as I have now. You don't gain anything
    by it, except the feeling of helping somebody to a career who
    would otherwise be without one.</p>

    <p>And who knows what we may achieve together for the
    future?</p>

    <p>Getting on with painting will continue to cause a lot of
    worry for a while, but when you see the studies, I hope you
    will see that it is no humbug.</p>

    <p>I've written you so often recently about my lack of money
    because the need is great. One must not become too weak
    physically, and one's self-respect must not be too damaged.
    When things get too bad and one gets pressed too hard, it's
    one's duty to look around and try to improve one's
    circumstances.</p>
