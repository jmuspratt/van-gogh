  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I wanted to write you last Sunday already, but I waited a
    little because I was trying to do something and its outcome was
    uncertain. A few weeks ago, I read Fritz Reuter's Ut mine
    Festungstid, in which he describes, in the most witty way, how
    Fritz Reuter and others who were confined in a fortress tried
    to make their life as comfortable as possible and to obtain
    several privileges from the town major.</p>

    <p>That book gave me the idea of attacking my landlord about
    certain improvements which would make work easier for me.</p>

    <p>And several times I have gone down to Voorburg, where he
    lives, in order to find out if he would do something for
    me.</p>

    <p>There were old shutters and boards which I wanted to use
    lying around there, but it was hard to get them. But I have
    them now.</p>

    <p>You know there are three windows in the studio. They let in
    far too much light, even when I cover them, and for a long time
    I have been thinking about how to remedy this.</p>

    <p><?showImage("314_V-T_2680");?>
     But he refused to do anything unless I paid for it. But now,
    after a new attack, I have six shutters and about six long
    boards.</p>

    <p>Those shutters are sawed in two now, so that both the upper
    and lower halves can be opened or closed at will, and the light
    let in or shut out from either above or below.</p>

    <p>From this little scratch you will see that it is pretty
    slick. And the boards are for a big closet in the alcove to put
    away drawings, prints, books, and to hang up different smocks
    and jackets, old coats, shawls, hats, and last but not least,
    the sou'wester - all the things which I need for the
    models.</p>

    <p>I have always paid the landlord regularly, and now I told
    him briefly and succinctly that if he thought the rent low, I
    wouldn't contradict this, but that I wanted him to consider
    that for me the rent itself was very heavy, and that I could
    not work well in this way and couldn't make progress before I
    had better light.</p>

    <p>That if he wouldn't change it, I, for my part, should really
    have to take another studio.</p>

    <p>That I wouldn't mind it if I had the money, but that under
    the circumstances I couldn't pay more than I did. So that to
    pay a higher rent was out of the question, and my staying or
    leaving would depend on his consenting to these improvements;
    if he didn't mind my leaving, well, we would separate on good
    terms, without more ado.</p>

    <p>Well, then he said No, he would do <i>something</i>, and so
    we at last arranged that I should only have to pay a few
    guilders in wages. He has been to the studio several times and
    is not exactly a penny pincher, though he is rather sharp
    (something of a Yankee), and the studio looked better than he
    had anticipated (he hadn't been there since last July) - at
    least, once in the studio he gave his consent, and even more
    readily than I had expected.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.people">If one had to deal with people only inside the studio! But
    personally I cannot get on well with people outside of it, and
    cannot get them to do anything.</label></p>

    <p>I've been drawing a few figures, rather large-size, bust or
    half-length, which, with a few others I already had, will
    become a kind of decoration for the hall and stairs, though
    they are really nothing but ordinary studies.</p>

    <p>So you can see from all this that I have thrown myself
    headlong into it again, in order to get new ideas.</p>

    <p>For instance, in Voorburg, when I went with him to pick out
    that wood, I saw beautiful things of workmen in a shed, and
    digging a cellar, and laying the foundation of a house. Then I
    thought again of the description you once gave me of those
    workmen in Montmartre when you witnessed an accident in a stone
    quarry.</p>

    <p>You know, I already had something in front of the windows,
    namely some canvas stretched on rods. This can be used for
    something else now, that is, it will make a very good
    background covered with a darker or lighter material - if one
    wants to draw heads, for instance.</p>

    <p>You understand that I can also shut one or two of the
    windows now, and so get one general light which will make the
    effects much stronger; they used to be neutralized by
    reflections or diffuse light.</p>

    <p>If I had had to pay for it myself, the job would have been
    quite out of the question because it would have been too
    expensive; but as it is, I am mighty glad to have it.</p>

    <p>I had felt the necessity for better light, especially when
    making those last drawings - for instance, those heads I sent
    you in which I used a deeper black.</p>

    <p><?showImage("314_V-T_2681");?>
     I hope everything will turn out well, but from this little
    scratch, you can see it is so simple that it must turn out
    well.</p>

    <p>How miserably these modern houses are constructed nowadays,
    compared to what they might be if they tried to make them a
    little more cozy. Compare a window of the present with one of
    Rembrandt's time. At that time everyone seemed to feel the need
    for a special kind of tempered light which doesn't seem to
    exist any more - a least they seem to aim at making it cold,
    harsh and unfeeling.</p>

    <p>The workmen's houses were all right in the beginning, but I
    don't see that they've progressed any in the last twenty or
    thirty years. Quite the opposite, the attractiveness is
    disappearing more and more, and is being replaced by something
    cold, systematic and methodical, which is becoming more and
    more unsatisfactory.</p>

    <p>If I could have afforded it, I should have had the windows
    fixed this way. It wouldn't have cost so much more if we hadn't
    had to use the blinds we had. The only difference is that each
    pane would have had a separate shutter, so that the shutters
    would have been a little smaller. But this way one could easily
    build a nice, pleasant window. But one can't have everything.
    And, in fact, a broad windowsill, which one can sit on, goes
    with it, but this house hasn't anything like that.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">I am very eager for your letter and news of your patient. I
    hope that she is in good spirits and that the recovery is
    normal and rapid. But sometimes things don't go so smoothly and
    rapidly, there is almost always some complication or other - at
    least, one must always be watchful.</label></p>

    <p>Last week I again read Notre Dame by Victor Hugo, which I
    had already read, more than ten years ago. Do you know what I
    found in it, at least, thought I found in it, so that I don't
    doubt Victor Hugo meant such a thing? I found Thijs Maris in
    Quasimodo.</p>

    <p>Probably most people who read Notre Dame have the impression
    that Quasimodo was a kind of fool. But, like myself, you would
    not find Quasimodo ridiculous, and, like myself, you would feel
    the truth of what Hugo says, &ldquo;Pour ceux qui savent que
    Quasimodo a exist&eacute;, maintenant `Notre Dame' est vide.
    Car non seulement il en &eacute;tait l'habitant mais il en
    &eacute;tait l'&acirc;me.&rdquo; [&ldquo;For those who know
    that Quasimodo once existed, `Notre Dame' is now empty. For not
    only did he live there, but he was the soul of it.&rdquo;]</p>

    <p>Taking Notre Dame as a symbol of that tendency in art which
    found its expression, for instance, in Leys and De Groux
    (sometimes), and Lagye, De Vriendt and Henri Pille, one can
    apply to Thijs Maris the words, &ldquo;Maintenant il y a un
    vide pour ceux qui savent qu'il a exist&eacute;, car il en
    &eacute;tait l'&acirc;me, et l'&acirc;me de cet art-l&agrave;
    c'&eacute;tait lui.&rdquo; Well, Thijs Maris still exists, but
    not in his full bloom and strength, not unscathed; and
    disenchanted <i>in so far as he can be disenchanted</i>.</p>

    <p>One of the most stupid things about the painters here is
    that even now they laugh at Thijs Maris. I think that as
    terrible as suicide. Why, as suicide? Because Thijs Maris is so
    much the personification of everything high and noble that in
    my opinion a painter cannot mock him without lowering himself.
    Whoever doesn't understand Maris, so much the worse for him;
    those who have understood him, mourn him, and regret that such
    a man has been broken. &ldquo;Noble lame, vil fourreau&rdquo;
    [A noble blade, a vile sheath] is applicable to Thijs Maris and
    to Quasimodo. &ldquo;Dans mon &acirc;me je suis beau.&rdquo;
    [Within my soul I am beautiful.]</p>

    <p>Well, write soon, if you haven't done so already. And
    believe me, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
