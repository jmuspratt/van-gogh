  <body>
    <p>Dear Brother,</p>

    <p>Although I wrote you yesterday, I want to add a few words
    today, first, to thank you for your letter and the money. But
    at the same time because I am alarmed at your patient's symptom
    of being &ldquo;somewhat low-spirited.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Perhaps it is only my imagination, and if so, tant mieux;
    nothing would please me more, for if there is no melancholy
    worth mentioning, and if it disappeared of its own accord, it
    would be that much better.</p>

    <p>But if it continues and you see that something's the matter
    - and speaking for myself, I think this will prove to be the
    case - then be careful, for then I think it is more serious,
    and the only useful physician will be not the doctor but
    yourself.</p>

    <p>If the low spirits and restlessness persist, I am afraid the
    reason is that the patient - notwithstanding all proofs of
    loyalty, and precisely because of all you have done for her -
    is tortured by the thought that sooner or later she will have
    to part company with you.</p>

    <p>We are brothers, aren't we, and friends, and we may tell
    each other unreservedly what we think; if I should act
    indiscreetly in telling you what I think, please forgive my
    indiscretion. For such matters may take a very distressing turn
    - and very quickly, too - if one does not act in time. In
    particular, the patient is morally so weak and overwrought and
    exhausted - although externally she may appear calm - that, in
    my opinion, she is passing through a mental crisis which is
    much more serious than if only the body were affected.</p>

    <p>Therefore, <i>if</i> that little cloud of melancholy
    persists, <i>if</i> there is a je ne sais quoi to interfere
    with the peace of mind which is absolutely necessary for her
    recovery, <i>if</i> it appears that she is thinking of
    something which she does not put into words, then, as I see it,
    there can be no doubt that just because of her weak and
    over-wrought condition, she is mortally afraid - I repeat,
    mortally afraid - because of the uncertainty whether you love
    her or not.</p>

    <p>In her heart there is an agitated, seething sea of love, but
    she will not put it into words for the very reason that unless
    you say so unreservedly and plainly, she will doubt whether you
    love her or not.</p>

    <p>This hidden anxiety may be so strong - although it is
    possible that the little cloud of outward melancholy is very
    small indeed, and hardly perceptible to you, and even less so
    to strangers - this anxiety may be so strong that recovery is
    <i>impossible</i>, and serious consequences may be expected if
    her mind is not set at ease on this point <i>&agrave; tout
    prix</i>. I know quite well that for discretion's sake you
    might not want to speak <i>at once</i>, but prefer to wait
    until the recovery is complete, and she is free and quite
    herself.</p>

    <p>Or it might be that you do not want to repeat yourself, and
    you might think, I have done enough to make it clear to her
    that I am her friend and that she may count on my doing
    everything in my power to help her.</p>

    <p>Yet I repeat, if the low spirits continue - and more than
    anything else this makes <i>rest</i> absolutely impossible, and
    without rest, no recovery - talk to her again, as your heart
    dictates.</p>

    <p>Dear brother, I am not speaking at random, but from my own
    soul and my own experience. This I can tell you about the case.
    When the woman was delivered of the child and the very
    difficult confinement was over, she was mortally weak, but for
    the moment her life was saved and the baby was alive and
    quiet.</p>

    <p>Twelve hours after the confinement I went to see her, and
    found her completely exhausted. When she saw me, she sat up in
    bed and became as cheerful and lively as if nothing had
    happened, and her eyes were radiant with love of life and with
    gratitude. And she wanted to recover, and she promised me she
    would.</p>

    <p>(As your last letter showed, you have discovered for
    yourself how necessary it is to <i>insist on such a promise</i>
    - and how necessary it is to <i>want to recover</i>. You have
    judged correctly.)</p>

    <p>But - a few days later I received a note from her which I
    did not quite understand, and which disappointed me; it
    contained something about &ldquo;she supposed I had probably
    taken another woman, etc.&rdquo; - in short, very queer and
    even absurd, as I myself had not quite recovered, and had left
    the hospital only a short time before. At any rate it was clear
    enough for me to understand that she was mentally confused and
    very upset. I went to her, immediately, that is, as soon as I
    <i>could</i>; I was not allowed to visit her on weekdays, so it
    was on Sunday, a week later. I found her looking as though she
    had <i>withered</i> - literally like a tree which had been
    blasted by a cold, dry wind, its young green shoots withering;
    and to make things complete, the baby was sick, too, and looked
    shrivelled. According to the doctor the baby was suffering from
    jaundice, but there was something else the matter with the
    eyes, as if they were blind, and the woman, who had <i>not</i>
    got jaundice, looked yellow, grey, I don't know what. In short,
    all this had happened within a week, and apparently - I know of
    no other expression for it - blighted and withered her so much
    that it gave me a shock.</p>

    <p>What was to be done? How had it come about, and what was
    there to be said? She herself told me she <i>could</i> not
    rest, and it was clear that she had become thoroughly
    melancholy - without any reason at all, without anything having
    happened since the preceding Sunday.</p>

    <p>Well, I thought, something must be done about it, and
    although I did not know for sure what the trouble was, I took a
    risk.</p>

    <p>I acted as if I were cross and said, Look, is this the way
    you keep your promises? And I made her repeat the promise that
    she would recover, and I showed great discontent at the baby's
    being sick, and I told her it was her fault, and I asked her
    what that letter of hers meant - in other words, as I saw her
    condition was abnormal, I myself spoke in an <i>abnormal</i>
    way, that is, sternly, whereas I felt nothing but a deep pity.
    The result was something like an awakening, as of a
    sleepwalker, and before I went away - not, of course, without
    having changed my tone - I once again let her renew her promise
    that she would get well et plus vite que &ccedil;a!</p>

    <p>Dear brother, from this moment on she recovered quickly, and
    after a short time I took her and the baby out of the hospital.
    Because of this the baby had a pretty long bout of ill health -
    perhaps because during the first few days the mother was
    thinking more about me than about her child - but of course at
    present the baby is as healthy as a young rabbit, and just like
    such a young rabbit, he is looking brightly out of his clear
    eyes which were at first completely closed. When I came to take
    the woman home, I waited for her in the little hospital waiting
    room; suddenly as she came in with the baby in her arms, a
    heart-rending pathos such as Ary Scheffer paints it, or
    Correszco, came over her.</p>

    <p>I repeat, if I am mistaken in thinking that in your
    patient's case there is also confusion or an inner struggle (of
    course, unjustified), so much the better; but if the signs of
    melancholy persist - let her promise once more she will get
    well, and show her unmistakably that <i>you</i> insist on her
    getting well, and that <i>you</i> cannot live without her. You
    see, sometimes a certain reticence prevents us from saying such
    a thing because it sounds egotistic, but don't feel embarrassed
    in this case, because it means saving her, and for that reason
    it is not egoism. For if two persons share their feelings to
    such an extent that they <i>cannot</i> be easy and calm in
    their minds when alone, egoism is out of the question, for then
    these two need not become one, <i>they are one already</i>.
    Only - this must be put into words, and with a sick person that
    craving for a real unbosoming may be such a <i>necessity</i>
    that recovery depends on it.</p>

    <p>And still I go on talking about this (don't take this going
    on amiss - for I feel obliged to tell you to the fullest extent
    what my opinion in this matter is); for days I have been
    imagining your patient to myself (but perhaps incorrectly - of
    course I can't know for sure; there are certain things which
    one can't help connecting with each other) as being necessarily
    in a condition similar to that of this woman of mine during the
    days following her confinement.</p>

    <p>I have been imagining this ever since receiving your letter
    in which you describe the operation, and I may say I have been
    disquieted by it all the time. And when I read she was somewhat
    low-spirited, I couldn't help writing about it. Almost from the
    very beginning - every time I tried to get a clear insight into
    the state of your patient's mind - taking into consideration
    that the series of calamities she has encountered cannot but
    have bewildered her - I thought her condition beyond the reach
    of any other remedy than love in the fullest sense of the
    word.</p>

    <p><i>Without you</i> I figure she is lost; I cannot think of
    any rescue, any renewal of the future, for her without you. And
    although I have discovered in your letters some expressions
    from which I see, at least which seem to show, that as for the
    future, you are in doubt about whether she for her part will
    love you forever and ever - I myself have only one opinion
    about this, which is that she loves you; and as far as you are
    concerned, I have only one question to ask, Did you tell her
    that you love her forever and ever, or have you been somewhat
    silent about it, either out of reticence or because you were
    afraid to hurt her?</p>

    <p>Of course I am speaking about these intimate matters (which
    on the whole I consider so intimate that I should never speak
    about them unless there were a clear reason for it) only
    because I see this resemblance between the cases of your
    patient and mine:</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li value="1">
        <p>Both had to undergo a dangerous operation, and both
        were, notwithstanding the chloroform, not wholly quiet
        during the operation.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="2">
        <p>Both were, shortly before the operation, severely shaken
        by anxiety and tension and perturbation of mind, and had to
        undergo moral sufferings which were almost more than the
        nervous system can stand.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="3">
        <p>Rest for body and soul is absolutely necessary for both
        of them in the interest of recovery and readjustment.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>I think these resemblances are important. And now that you
    have mentioned a sort of melancholy, I believed it would be
    profitable for you to hear how it became very serious in my
    patient's case, even alarming and dangerous, and this within
    only a few days, and how - after her mind had been set at ease
    by the very security of a new love which made her gain hope and
    confidence in the future - she very soon recovered physically,
    at least, from the operation.</p>

    <p>As for me, before that time I had reassured her as
    emphatically as I could that I should never leave her - less by
    words, however, than by doing whatever I could for her, but
    nevertheless in words too. Notwithstanding this, doubt and
    restlessness arose in her mind - but they disappeared as soon
    as I did my best to reassure her again.</p>

    <p>May I remind you that I raised certain objections because in
    your earlier letter you hinted at having mentioned a job - I
    already had some nebulous misgivings then - and now you write
    about the first signs of melancholy - well, this is what I
    feared.</p>

    <p>I hope quite unnecessarily - but if the melancholy persists,
    and the restlessness too, and the je ne sais quoi which is
    interfering with her recovery - then my opinion is that a
    renewed assurance of your love and loyalty will ease her mind
    and enable her to get well again - yes, I truly think her life
    may depend on it.</p>

    <p>Adieu, my dear fellow, I have written this to the best of my
    knowledge, and prompted by an unfeigned sympathy and a deep
    interest - but this you of course know, and it is my earnest
    desire that things turn out favourably. Once more, thanks for
    your letter and what you sent. Without my meaning it, my letter
    about &ldquo;somewhat low-spirited&rdquo; has grown to such a
    size that there is no room to write anything else. Believe me,
    with a handshake and my best wishes,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Written at the top of the letter] <label content="health.eyes">Until today every night
    or morning when I woke up, my eyelids were stuck together
    because of the discharge, but last night for the first time
    both eyes were all right. Otherwise nothing was apparent except
    for the whites being somewhat muddy and bloodshot and what they
    call bags (?) under the eyes, but this is as good as gone,
    too.</label></p>
