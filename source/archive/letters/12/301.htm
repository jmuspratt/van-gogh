  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">Thanks for your letter, thanks for the enclosure, though I
    cannot repress a feeling of sadness at your saying, &ldquo;I
    can give you little hope for the future.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If you mean this only in a financial sense, I shouldn't mind
    it so much, but if it's in reference to my work, I don't quite
    understand why I deserve it. It comes just at the moment when I
    can send you the prints of the photographs of a few of my
    largest drawings which I had promised you before, but couldn't
    get because I had no money.</p>

    <p>I do not know what you mean by that expression, how can I
    know it? Your letter is too short, but it hit me unexpectedly
    right in the heart.</label></p>

    <p>But I should like to know what you really mean by it,
    whether you have noticed that I have made some progress or
    not.</p>

    <p>You will remember that when you wrote me a month ago about
    the finances being bad, my answer was, &ldquo;All right, that
    much more reason to do our utmost on both sides; do try to send
    me what's strictly necessary; for my part, I will do my utmost
    to make progress, so that perhaps we can sell something to the
    magazines.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Since then I have started several larger compositions which
    have more in them than the studies of a single figure.</p>

    <p>So now my first batch of photographs for you to show to some
    artists coincides with your &ldquo;I can give you little hope
    for the future.&rdquo; Has anything happened?</p>

    <p>It makes me nervous, you must write again soon.</p>

    <p>As you see, the photos are: <i><art id=1035>Sower</art>,<art id=1034> Potato Diggers</art>,<art id=1031> Peat
    Cutters</i></art>. I've had some others made: <i><art id=1028>Sand Pit</art>, <art id=1035a>Burning of
    Weeds</art>, Refuse Dump, Potato Digger</i>, one figure, <i>Coal
    Hewers</i>, and now last week at Scheveningen I have been
    working on <i>Mending of Nets</i> (Scheveningen
    fisherwomen).</p>

    <p>And then two other large compositions of labourers in the
    dunes (one of which I showed to Tersteeg) which, though they
    still require hard work, are the things I should most like to
    finish.</p>

    <p>Long rows of diggers - poor people employed by the
    municipality - in front of a patch of sandy ground, which must
    be dug. But it is enormously difficult to make. You may find
    the first conception of it in the &ldquo;Peat
    Cutters.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It wouldn't make me so melancholy, brother, if you hadn't
    added something which worries me. You say, &ldquo;Let us hope
    for better times.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>You see, in my opinion that is one of those things one
    should beware of. <i>To hope for better times must not be a
    feeling but an action in the present</i>. My actions
    depend on yours in that if you should stop sending money, I
    couldn't go on and should just be in a desperate position.</p>

    <p>Just because I felt the hope for better times strongly, I
    threw all my strength into the present work, without thinking
    of the future other than to trust the work would find its
    wages, though we must pinch ourselves as to food, drink and
    clothes more and more every week.</p>

    <p>There was the question of Scheveningen, the question of
    painting. I thought, &ldquo;All right, let's carry it
    through.&rdquo; But now I could almost wish I had not started
    it, boy, for the expenses are heavy and I cannot meet them.</p>

    <p>The weeks passed - many, many weeks and months of late -
    when the expenses were repeatedly heavier than I could afford,
    notwithstanding all my worrying and economizing and however
    much I racked my brains. As soon as your money arrives, I must
    not only manage to live ten days on it, <label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">but I have so many
    things to pay for at once that from the start those ten days
    which are ahead are bound to mean starvation. And the woman has
    to nurse the baby, and the baby is strong and growing, and it
    often happens that she has no milk for it.</p>

    <p>And it happens to me, too: when I am sitting in the dunes or
    somewhere else, I have a faint feeling in my stomach because
    there isn't enough to eat.</label></p>

    <p>The whole family's shoes are patched and worn out, and there
    are many more of such small miseries which put furrows in one's
    face.</p>

    <p>Well, I should not care, Theo, if I could only stick to the
    thought, It will come out right, we must go on. But now your
    saying, &ldquo;I can give you little hope for the
    future,&rdquo; is like &ldquo;the hair that finally breaks the
    camel's back&rdquo; to me. The burden is sometimes so heavy
    that one extra hair is enough to make the animal sink to the
    ground.</p>

    <p>Now what am I to do? I saw Blommers twice in Scheveningen
    and spoke to him, and he saw a few of my things and asked me to
    come and see him.</p>

    <p>I made a few painted studies there, a bit of the sea, a
    potato field, a field with net menders, and here in the studio,
    a fellow in a potato field planting cabbage in the empty spots
    between the potato plants; and then I am working on the large
    drawing of the mending of nets.</p>

    <p>But I feel my ardour vanishing, one needs to have a fixed
    point somewhere. When you say, &ldquo;Set your hopes on the
    future,&rdquo; it sounds to me as if you yourself had no
    confidence in me.</p>

    <p>Is this true? I can't help it, my spirits are low because of
    all these cares. I only wish you were here.</p>

    <p>You say that the effect of the lithographs is somewhat
    meager. I am not in the least surprised when I think of how a
    man's physique influences his work, and my life is too cramped
    and meager. Really, Theo, we ought to have had a little more to
    eat for the sake of the work, but I could not afford it, and it
    will remain so as long as I cannot breathe a little more
    freely.</p>

    <p>Therefore, please do show the photographs to Buhot or
    somebody, if you cannot send more yourself, and try to get
    something accepted with his help.</p>

    <p>I am almost sorry to have started painting again, for I wish
    I hadn't begun it if I can't carry on. I can't do without
    colours, and colours are expensive, and I can't get more on
    credit because I still owe a little to Leurs and Stam. And yet
    I love painting so.</p>

    <p>While I was at it, some of last year's things caught my
    fancy again, and I have painted studies hanging in the studio
    once more.</p>

    <p>The sea, which I love enormously, must be brushed in oil,
    otherwise one cannot get hold of it.</p>

    <p>Look here, Theo, I only hope you won't get discouraged, for
    indeed, when you speak of, &ldquo;giving no hope for the
    future,&rdquo; it makes me melancholy. You must keep courage
    and energy to send the money, otherwise I'm on the rocks and
    cannot go on, for those who might be friends have become
    enemies and seem to want to remain so. Think it over well -
    that in fact I never did anything which accounts for this - at
    least, I cannot account for it - for instance, Mauve's or
    Tersteeg's or C. M.'s being so indifferent that they refuse to
    see my work or to speak a word to me. It is human to be angry
    about something, but it is not right to cling to that anger,
    even after a year has elapsed and after repeated efforts to
    make up.</p>

    <p>So for today I finish with the question, Theo, when you
    spoke to me about painting in the beginning, and if we had then
    foreseen my current work, should we have hesitated in thinking
    it right for me to become a painter (or draughtsman, what's the
    difference?)</p>

    <p>I do not think we should have hesitated about going on then
    if we could have foreseen these photographs for instance,
    should we? For surely it takes a painter's hand and eye to
    create such a scene in the dunes, in some form or other.</p>

    <p>But now it often happens that I feel so downhearted when I
    see people behave so hostilely and indifferently that I lose
    all my courage. But then I cheer up again, and go back to my
    work and laugh at it, and because I work in the present, and
    let no day go by without working, I believe that there is
    indeed hope for me in the future, though I do not feel it, for
    I tell you, there is no space left in my brain for
    philosophizing about the future, either for upsetting me or for
    comforting me. I think my duty is to stick to the present with
    regard to me, too, and let us persevere as far as we can
    persevere, today rather than tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Yet, Theo, you need not spare me if it's only a question of
    money - if only as a friend and a brother you keep a little
    sympathy for my work, saleable or unsaleable. If only I may
    keep your sympathy in this respect, I care very little for all
    the rest, and we must calmly and deliberately find ways and
    means. In case there is no financial hope for the future, I
    should propose moving to the country, to some village <i>quite
    in the country</i>, saving half of the house rent; and for the
    same money one spends here on <i>bad</i> food, we should have
    good, healthy food, necessary for the woman and the children -
    in fact, for me too. At the same time it would perhaps have
    advantages for taking models too.</p>

    <p>You know I painted last summer - I have hung several of
    these studies on the walls again, because while making new
    ones, it struck me there was something in them after all.</p>

    <p>That painting helped me indirectly in my drawing during the
    winter months and in the spring, and I carried this on as far
    as these last drawings. Now, however, I feel that it would be
    good to paint for a time, and that I need this to get a
    stronger tone in the drawings, also. I intended to paint the
    women sitting in the grass mending nets on a rather large
    scale, but after your letter I shall postpone it till I have
    seen you. I got more copies of the lithographs, but they are
    still weak; the man says he ought to have used more ink, and he
    will soon give me some even better ones.
    &ldquo;N'importe,&rdquo; I have tried the experiment of making
    a small-size sketch for illustration.</p>

    <p>Oh, Theo, I could make so much more progress if I could
    spend a little more. But I can't find the way out, I am
    handicapped by expenses everywhere. When I read the biographies
    of other painters, I find that they all needed money and were
    miserable when they couldn't go on.</p>

    <p>Do write soon, for I feel upset and doubt whether to dare go
    on with Scheveningen because of the expense of the painting
    materials.</p>

    <p>Since then I have spoken to Breitner about the three
    compositions he had started on. It was indeed true that he had
    made them in a moment when he was not himself. He said he was
    sorry to have made them in such a manner, and showed me another
    composition of the drunkard and studies of common streetwalkers
    which were infinitely better. And I also saw a few watercolours
    he was working on and a picture of a smithy - all were done
    with a calmer and firmer hand and mind. I read a book he lent
    me: Soeur Philom&egrave;ne by de Goncourt, who wrote Gavarni.
    The story takes place in a hospital; it is very good.</p>

    <p>I had hoped that you could send something; at all events -
    especially if you have no money - you must write me soon, for
    it is hard to keep courage the way things are. I think the
    drawings of which the photographs are taken not yet deep enough
    of tone; they do not sufficiently express the emotion roused by
    nature, but if you compare them with what I made in the
    beginning, with the figures I made at first, I think I am not
    mistaken if I see a current of progress, and we must not lose
    hold of this current.</p>

    <p>So let us try to drudge on.</p>

    <p>I only wish you could come here.</p>

    <p>At all events write soon. Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I do not approve, Theo, of spending more than one receives,
    but when it is a question of going on strike or working on, I
    vote for working on to the utmost.</p>

    <p>Millet and the other masters worked on till writs were
    served on them, or some have been in prison, or have had to
    move from one place to another, but I do not see that any one
    of them gave up his work.</p>

    <p>And I am only beginning, but I see it from afar, like a dark
    shadow, and sometimes it makes my work gloomy.</p>
