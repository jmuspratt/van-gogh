  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>On my coming home I found your postcard, which arrived a few
    moments after I went away this morning; I see from it that
    apart from having your model this afternoon, you also had an
    engagement in the morning. I am sorry you did not tell me, for
    we might have gone together.</p>

    <p>For the rest - the pleasure of seeing your work is no trifle
    to me, and if it's true that I didn't upset your plans too
    much, I'm delighted with my visit to you. <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>But it wasn't my fault, as I hadn't received your postcard,
    which I only just found.</p>

    <p>I repeat, I think your work is excellent - I think the
    sketch of the &ldquo;Woman Spinning&rdquo; especially is
    excellent too, indeed I do - that is <i>it</i>.</p>

    <p>I wish you had a charcoal drawing of the &ldquo;Tile
    Painters&rdquo; too; I suggest you still make one. Why? -
    because such compositions most certainly come out strongly in
    painting, in which state they are in many respects truer to
    nature and more vigorously accented.... <i>But</i> the black
    and white or the light and brown in itself may acquire a
    peculiar charm - and has its own merits, and is at the same
    time suitable for reproduction - a photograph of the painted
    &ldquo;Tile Painters&rdquo; is doomed to be a failure, as the
    blue would come out white in the reproduction.</p>

    <p>I think the heads [studies] of the blind men eminently good.
    Are you willing to decide in principle that we are to visit
    each other again before the end of the year?</p>

    <p>Here follows a passage from Dickens that expresses
    forcefully what goes on in the mind of a figure painter while
    he is working on a composition:</p>

    <p>I was occupied with this story during many working hours of
    two years. I must have been very ill employed, if I could not
    leave its merits and demerits as a whole to express themselves
    on its being read as a whole. But, as it is not unreasonable to
    suppose that I may have held its various threads with a more
    <i>continuous attention</i> than any one else can have given to
    them during its desultory publication, it is not unreasonable
    to ask that the weaving may be looked at in its complete state,
    and with the pattern finished - Preface, Little
    Dorrit<i>.</i></p>

    <p>Here you are, my dear friend, beautifully expressed, how a
    figure painter deserves to be looked at - <i>as a
    whole</i><i>.</i></p>

    <p>This is how I looked at your work today, and my sympathy for
    you was confirmed by it. And as for you, I want you to go on
    looking at me as a whole too, which many others don't do.</p>

    <p>What I think excellent too is that one sees books in your
    studio: Hugo, Zola, Dickens - figure painter's books. I shall
    send you Erckmann-Chatrian's Histoire d'un Paysan<i>.</i> The
    French Revolution - that is the central point - the
    Constitution of 1789 being the modern Gospel, no less sublime
    than that of 1 A.D. And how one can be a figure painter without
    feeling something of it is incomprehensible to me - and I find
    a certain emptiness in these figure painters' studios where the
    modern writings are absent. And I think that's your impression
    too.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I forgot to take with me? - the
    &ldquo;Gr&egrave;ve des Charbonniers&rdquo; [Strike of the
    Miners] by Robe, which I think you have in duplicate. I have it
    myself, but it was intended for Van der Weele, who - between
    you and me - is sorely in need of seeing some foreign
    compositions and, I think, is somewhat afflicted with Dutch
    prejudices - though he has freed himself of them in his large
    picture.</p>

    <p>What I wanted to say about the printer's ink was, Just
    dabble a little with it - at random, as it were, and out of
    your own imagination, on a piece of paper or an old study, just
    to see the effect. But go easy on the turpentine; then I think
    you will find things in it that you will be able to use.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">And try washing with a wet brush in something you have drawn
    with litho-graphic crayon. If you take the trouble, you will be
    able to find some things in the printer's ink that will be
    useful and practical - probably more and better things than I
    have found myself up to now.</label></p>

    <p>How beautiful your illustrations by Lhermitte, Perret and
    Bastien Lepage are. If I were you, I should make more of those
    beautiful heads, like the ones of those blind men. I am going
    to try it with a finer pencil too.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>With reference to novelists, isn't it your opinion too that
    one knows such writers as Dickens, Balzac, Hugo, Zola only when
    one has a general idea of their works as a whole? I think the
    same applies to Michelet and Erckmann-Chatrian.</p>
