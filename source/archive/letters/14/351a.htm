    <p>[Letter to his friend `the land surveyor']</p>

    <p>Amice Furn&eacute;e,</p>

    <p>This morning I received your letter informing me of your
    departure for the East Indies, which is to take place soon.</p>

    <p>Little had I thought it would happen so soon. From the
    bottom of my heart I hope that you will acclimatize yourself
    successfully in the Indies. Perhaps this will be easier now
    than if you had stayed in Holland for a long time, and had done
    a lot of painting here. In such a case, if one had lost oneself
    in the grey gloom of this country, it might be difficult to
    enter into the character of the Indian scenery. But under the
    circumstances, if you try hard to enter completely into the
    character of the scenery there, I think you will succeed yet.
    And who knows what curiously picturesque scenes you may find
    over there?</p>

    <p>Many French painters and others have felt the advantage of
    going to Algeria or Egypt, and I have the impression that the
    Indies will present similar effects to a certain extent.</p>

    <p>Similarly, some painters went to China and Japan, and I have
    seen excellent things from these countries.</p>

    <p>It pleases me very much that you go on being warmly attached
    to painting, and I believe that, provided you persevere, you
    will go a long way. Especially as you will have to be outdoors
    a good deal professionally.</p>

    <p>With me things are going fairly well here in Brabant, at
    least I find nature here very stimulating.</p>

    <p><?showImage("413_V-F_351a0");?>
     Now the last few weeks I have done <art id=1114>four</art> watercolours<art id=1107> of</art>
    <i>weavers</i>. And some others of <art id=1113>a lumber auction</art>
    and an interior with a little seamstress and a gardener,
    all watercolours. Herewith some sketches of them.</p>

    <p>[Sketch &ldquo;Gardener with Wheelbarrow, JH 440]</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Enclosed another order for your father. I hope you will be
    kind enough to select the watercolour brushes yourself, not too
    thin and not too thick; the same as are generally used.
    Something like this:</label></p>

    <p>Well, amice, I shall always remember with great pleasure
    many a walk we took together last summer.</p>

    <p>And be assured I shall never forget you, and you will
    greatly oblige me by letting me hear something from you as soon
    as you are over there. On my part I am going to send you a few
    sketches of things I am working on.</p>

    <p>And now I wish you a pleasant voyage and prosperity in your
    enterprises, and particularly prosperity in your painting
    too.</p>

    <p>With a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>Kindly tell your father that I shall send him the money for
    the bill outstanding and this order by January 20.</p>
