  <body>
    <p>Dear Brother,</p>

    <p>Perhaps you were rather astonished when I told you briefly
    that I intended to go home for a while, and that I should write
    you from here. But first I have to thank you for your letter of
    December 1, which I just now received here at Nuenen.<br>
     <label content="health.general">For the last three weeks already I have not felt quite well -
    all kinds of little troubles arising from having caught a cold,
    and also from nervousness.</label><br>
     One must try to conquer such a thing, and I felt it would get
    worse if I did not get a change.<br>
     So for several reasons I made up my mind to go home for a
    while. A thing which, however, I was very loath to do.<br>
     My journey began with a good six-hour walk across the heath -
    to Hoogeveen. On a stormy afternoon in rain and snow.<br>
     That walk cheered me greatly, or rather my feelings were so in
    sympathy with nature that it calmed me more than anything. I
    thought that perhaps my going back home might give me a clearer
    insight into questions of how to act.<br>
     Drenthe is splendid, but one's being able to stay there
    depends on many things, depends on whether one is able to stand
    the loneliness. I believe Father would consider that question
    settled by a conclusion drawn from an ordinary conversation,
    but for my part I am in no hurry to decide it, and, for
    instance, I want to see what I think of it after having been
    here about a week or so. But for the present I am quite in the
    dark as to how to act in that respect.<br>
     One by no means arrives at a satisfactory conclusion by
    thinking or speaking about the question, that's what I see more
    and more. At one moment it seems more possible than at
    another.<br>
     And I for my part do not drop problems suddenly, but keep
    turning them over in my mind, sometimes long after other people
    consider them settled. But, boy, it is so difficult for me, it
    becomes so much a matter of conscience that I should be too
    great a burden to you, that I should perhaps abuse your
    friendship when I accept money for an enterprise which perhaps
    will not pay.<br>
     You write again about Moniteur Universel.<br>
     Do you think my opinion too pessimistic when I declare it
    <i>possible</i> that within relatively few years a number of
    great art enterprises, like the Moniteur Universel for instance
    - and others still more overexpanded - will dwindle down - will
    fall into decadence as quickly as they came up? All art
    business that remained in touch with real art began to flourish
    within a relatively few years. But it became too much a money
    speculation, and is so even now - I do not say <i>quite</i> - I
    simply say <i>too much</i> so; and being a speculation, why
    shouldn't it go, as with the bulb trade? You will say that a
    picture is no tulip. Of course there is the widest difference,
    and of course <i>I</i> who love pictures, and tulips not at
    all, am perfectly well aware of this.<br>
     But I am sure that many rich people who buy expensive
    pictures, for some reason or other, do not do so because of the
    art value they find in them - the difference which you and I
    see between a tulip and a picture is invisible to such people.
    They, the speculators and &ldquo;pochards blas&eacute;s&rdquo;
    and many others, would buy tulips now just as before - if only
    it were fashionable.<br>
     There are real, serious connoisseurs, yes, but it is perhaps
    only a tenth of all the business that is transacted, perhaps
    even a much smaller part of it, of which it can be said that it
    was really done for the love of art. Of course I could go on
    enlarging on this theme forever, but without insisting on it
    further, I think you will agree with me that in the art-dealing
    business there is much that in the future might prove to be
    empty air.<br>
     The price of pictures, now raised enormously, may go down. If
    you ask me, Can Millet and Corot go down? I say, <i>In price,
    Yes</i>.<br>
     From an artistic point of view of course, Millet is Millet,
    Corot, Corot, fixed like the sun itself - in my opinion at
    least.<br>
     Five years ago I thought differently, I thought that, for
    instance, Millet would remain stable <i>even</i> in price; but
    since then - just because I see how generally Millet is
    completely misunderstood since he has become less obscure and
    more widely reproduced, for instance, than when he was ignored
    - I have feared he will never be appreciated by the public at
    large, and - it is not sure that those who understand him best
    will have to pay so much money for his pictures later on as
    they must now. Rembrandt's work also went down <i>in price</i>
    during the periwig-and-pigtail period.<br>
     I should like to ask you frankly, Do you believe that the
    present prices will hold? I tell you frankly<i>,</i> <i>I do
    not think so</i>. <i><br>
    </i> But at the same time, for me Millet is Millet, Rembrandt
    is Rembrandt, Isra&euml;ls is Isra&euml;ls, etc., whether their
    pictures cost twopence or a hundred thousand guilders.
    Consequently, I do not give much thought to the art-dealing
    business. I do so only when I think of you, and when I want to
    ask you if <i>you really can like it</i>, if you will not see,
    especially later on, many things that are too distasteful for
    you to stand. You will say, &ldquo;One gets used to
    everything&rdquo;; or rather you will say, &ldquo;We must live
    on until our hearts break within us.&rdquo; Maybe so, I agree
    with you in this - but if our hearts needs must break within
    us, we are still free to act in one way or another. And as to
    you or me, we are what we are, and as we have enthusiasm for
    art within us, we should, each in his own way, stick to our
    opinion about Millet, for instance, even if the most absurd
    things happened.<br>
     But I ask you, In case of a gradual decline in the enormous
    prices for pictures, how can the great houses make up for it,
    which yearly spend formidable sums on advances, etc., which
    have to be deducted from their profit - they will soon have to
    be contented with great deficits. Such trees do not fall at the
    first stroke, but they can molder away inside and fall at last,
    without one stroke of the axe, only by the wind; when? I have
    no idea of the exact date.<br>
     just write me on this question in general, for instance, what
    you think of the stability - in the long run - of an
    establishment such as you say Moniteur Universel is - or Petit
    - or Arnold &amp; Tripp. I tell you frankly, I do not see how
    they can keep it up in the long run. I think such things must
    collapse.<br>
     I think it must be rather uncomfortable to assist at such a
    thing - I prefer to sit and paint by a peat fire.<br>
     Then one feels only a certain &ldquo;qu'est ce que ca me
    fait&rdquo; [what do I care] for the whole art-dealing business
    - except - except - that I personally think it very unpleasant
    to be too short of money.<br>
     You always remained your own calm self in Paris, very simple,
    and certainly cooler than a man like Tripp, for instance.<br>
     You care to see things only as they are; you, as well as I,
    <i>cannot</i> help analyzing. And yet <i>even</i> you do not
    use your knowledge of a situation primarily to profit by it in
    spite of difficulties.<br>
     I mean, fishing in troubled water is not in your
    character.<br>
     But I ask you frankly, how is it? do you really believe
    Moniteur Universel will ask anything else of its employees than
    G. &amp; Co. does ? Moniteur, G. &amp; Co., Tripp, Petit - they
    are all alike to me. I myself believe that having been thrown
    out of one, I should be thrown out of all. If old Mr. Goupil
    says, You are not the man for us, I believe other managers
    would think the same.<br>
     Now as for you, I think what is happening to you at Goupil's
    would happen to you in any other firm - and setting up in
    business for oneself at a time when a cooling off and decline
    in the market is to be expected is something which in my
    opinion one would not undertake enthusiastically.<br>
     Do you have confidence in the present times, do you believe
    trade will remain at this high pitch?<br>
     If you believed it, I should respect your opinion and hold my
    tongue, but I do not know <i>if you are aware that I do not
    exactly believe that the very big business will prove
    reliable</i>.<br>
     Do write me about this, then it will be so much easier for me
    to speak about it. I feel a little embarrassed with you just
    now, and I want you to know my possibly nervous opinion that,
    in the first place, I do not believe those inflated affairs
    will last, and in the second place, though they might last, I
    should not like to take part in them either directly or
    indirectly.<br>
     Another question is, If I can provide for myself by doing
    anything here or there, I will not look such a gift horse in
    the mouth.<br>
     If it proves to be my duty to do something or other, very
    well, I will not refuse the work, even unpleasant work.<br>
     I thought of you, brother, during that long walk across the
    heath, in the evening, in the storm. I thought of a passage, I
    don't know from what book: &ldquo;Deux yeux &eacute;claircies
    par de vraies larmes veillaient;&rdquo; [two eyes were awake,
    brightened by genuine tears]. I thought, <i>I am
    disillusioned</i>. I thought, <i>I</i> have believed in many
    things which I now know are really sorry fallacies - I thought,
    Those eyes of mine, here on this gloomy evening, wide awake in
    this deserted region - if they have been full of tears at
    times, why shouldn't these have been wrung from me by a sorrow
    that disenchants - yes - and disturbs illusions - but at the
    same time - makes one wide awake.<br>
     I thought, <i>It's impossible</i> that Theo is satisfied with
    many things that worry me?<br>
     Is it possible that it is only my own melancholy when I cannot
    enjoy some things as I used to do?<br>
     In short, I thought, Is it possible that I take gold for
    tinsel? Do I call withered a thing that is in full bloom? I
    could not find an answer, can you? Are you sure that there
    isn't a far-advanced, inexorable decadence everywhere? Give me
    courage, if you have courage yourself, but I ask you in my
    turn, &ldquo;Do not flatter me.&rdquo;<br>
     As to myself, I declare I believe that even if I became very
    clever (which I am not as yet) I believe - firmly believe -
    that I shall always be very poor, that it will be more than I
    expect if I succeed in keeping out of debt.<br>
     Those who are the coming men in Holland <i>now</i>, the
    mastodons, Mesdag, Isra&euml;ls, Blommers, Maris, and so on,
    will under no circumstances earn more than was earned in the
    past, namely during the past twenty years, for instance. Not
    even in the case of cleverness - especially not then. One of
    the drawbacks of a period like the one which is approaching is
    that a time in which the prices are run up so high can be said
    to put a lien on the future, which makes the future dark for
    posterity.<br>
     You who are as clever as Uncle Vincent, for instance, will not
    be able to do what Uncle Vincent did. Why not? - because there
    are too many Arnolds and Tripps in the world. Insatiable
    money-wolves, compared to whom you are but a sheep. Please do
    not take my making this comparison as an insult, brother, it is
    better to be a sheep than a wolf, better to be slain than to
    slay - better to be Abel than Cain. And, and - I hope, or
    rather I am sure, that I am not a wolf either.<br>
     Suppose that it's not just in our imagination, but that you
    and I are really like sheep among our fellow creatures. All
    right - granting the existence of rather hungry and false
    wolves, it would not be impossible that we should be devoured
    someday. Well, this may not be so very pleasant, but I tell
    myself: It is, after all, better to be ruined than to do the
    ruining. I mean, there is no reason to lose one's serenity if
    one should realize that one might have to lead a life of
    poverty, even if one possesses all the qualities, the
    knowledge, the capacities, which make other people rich. I am
    not indifferent to money, but I do not understand the wolves.
    Well, with a warm handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>If you like, give me an answer to some of these questions
    while I am here at home; I am here to get some rest and to
    arrive at some decision.</p>
