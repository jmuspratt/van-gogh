  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I ask you - also on my parents' behalf - whether you would
    like to come here one of these days - as soon as you
    please.</p>

    <p>My mother's recovery has now progressed so far that she can
    sit in an easy chair in the living room, goes out in a Bath
    chair, is beginning to walk again, etc., etc. So her recovery
    has gone more smoothly than we dared expect in the
    beginning.</p>

    <p>The trees are blossoming outside, and at the moment the
    weather is still not too hot for long rambles.</p>

    <p>A few days ago I sent you three more pen-and-ink drawings,
    <sup>1</sup> &ldquo;Little Ditch,&rdquo; [F 1243, JH 472]
    &ldquo;Norway Pines in the Fen,&rdquo; [F 1249, JH 473]
    &ldquo;Thatched Roofs&rdquo; [F 1242, JH 474]; I thought you
    would like the subjects. <label content="art.technique">As for the execution, I should have
    wished with all my heart that the direction of the pen
    scratches had followed the forms more expressively, and that
    the forces which render the tone of the masses expressed their
    shape more clearly at the same time. I think you will admit
    that I did not systematically or intentionally neglect the
    composition of things, their shape, but I had to take a shot at
    it in a rough sort of way in order to render the effect of
    light and brown - the atmosphere of the scenery as it was at
    that moment - the general aspect - as well as I could. For at
    present one can see these three things together only at special
    moments.</label></p>

    <p>I hope you will come. Of course you will bring along your
    tools, and the more you bring of your work the better I shall
    like it. I should like to see that sketch of the &ldquo;Females
    of Terschelling&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Little Weaver&rdquo;
    again.</p>

    <p>My parents join me in sending regards.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I think that when you come it will be a good opportunity to
    bring with you all the drawings of mine that you have at home.
    Then we can resume our work together on a number of new
    subjects, if you feel like it.</p>

    <p>It is always a good thing to let one's work wander around a
    bit; and if people don't like it, well, never mind - show it
    again later anyway. If some people you've happened to show
    these studies to have disapproved of them or laughed at them or
    said of them no matter what, they will change their minds if
    they continue to see them over and over again - not all of
    them, but some.</p>

    <p>I am eager for you to see my painted studies again.</p>

    <p>1. See letter 366 to Theo.</p>
