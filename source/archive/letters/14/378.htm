  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter, thanks for the enclosure.</p>

    <p>Now look here. What you say is all very well and good, but
    as for scandal, I am now somewhat better prepared to meet it
    than I used to be to nip it in the bud. No fear of Father or
    Mother leaving, for example. <i>Although they have only just
    received a new call</i>. (Father and Mother could, if anything,
    consolidate their position here, if they managed things
    properly.)</p>

    <p>Now, there are people who say to me &ldquo;Why did you have
    anything to do with <i>her</i>,&rdquo; [Margot] - that's
    <i>one</i> fact. And there are people who say to her,
    &ldquo;Why did you have anything to do with <i>him</i>,&rdquo;
    - that's another fact.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.love">Apart from that, both she and I have grief enough and
    trouble enough, but as for regrets - neither of us have any.
    Look here - I believe without question, or have the certain
    knowledge, that she loves me. I believe without question, or
    have the certain knowledge, that I love her. It has been
    sincerely meant. But has it also been foolish, etc?</label></p>

    <p>Perhaps, if you like - but aren't <i>the wise ones</i>,
    those who never do anything foolish, even more foolish in my
    eyes than I am in theirs? <i>That's</i> my reply to your
    argument and to other people's arguments. I say all this simply
    by way of <i>explanation</i><i>,</i> not out of ill-will or
    spite.</p>

    <p>You say that you like <i>Octave Mouret</i>, you say
    that you are like him. I've read the second volume too, since
    last year, and like him much better in that than I did in the
    first. The other day I heard it said that `Au Bonheur des
    dames' would not add greatly to Zola's reputation. I consider
    it contains some of his <i>greatest</i> and <i>best</i> things.
    I have just looked it up and am copying out a few of Octave
    Mouret's words for you.</p>

    <p>Don't you think you've been moving in <i>Bourdoncles'</i>
    direction <i>during the last</i> 1&frac12; years or so? You
    would have done better to stick to `Mouret', that was and still
    is my opinion. Save for the enormous difference in
    circumstances, indeed, the diametrically opposed circumstances,
    I actually lean more in the direction of Mouret <i>than you</i>
    might think - when it comes to <i>belief in</i> women and the
    realization that one needs them, must love them. Mouret says,
    &ldquo;Chez nous <i>on aime</i> la client&egrave;le.&rdquo; [At
    our place <i>we love</i> the clientele.] Do give this some
    thought - and remember my regret when you said that you had
    &ldquo;cooled off.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I now repeat more emphatically than ever everything I said
    by way of bitter warning against the influence of what I called
    Cuizot-esqueness. Why? Because it leads to mediocrity. And I do
    not want to see you among the mediocrities, because I have
    loved you too much, indeed still do, to bear watching you
    petrify. I know things are difficult, I know that I know too
    little about you, I know that I may be mistaken. But anyway, do
    read your Mouret again.</p>

    <p>I mentioned the difference and <i>yet</i> the parallels
    between Mouret and what I should like. Now look. Mouret
    worships the modern Parisian woman - fine. <i>But Millet and
    Breton</i> [worship] <i>the peasant woman with the same
    passion</i>. The two passions are <i>one and the same</i>.</p>

    <p>Read Zola's description of women in a room in the twilight -
    most of the women aged between 30 and 50 - such a sombre,
    mysterious place. I find it <i>splendid</i>, indeed
    <i>sublime</i>.</p>

    <p>But to me, Millet's Ang&eacute;lus is just as sublime, with
    that same twilight, that same infinite emotion - or that single
    figure of Breton's in the Luxembourg, or his
    &ldquo;Source.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>You will say that I am not a success - vaincre or &ecirc;tre
    vaincu, [to conquer [or] to be conquered], it doesn't matter to
    me, one has feeling and movement in any event, and they are
    more akin than they may seem to be or than can be put into
    words.</p>

    <p>As for <i>this</i> particular woman, it remains a mystery
    how it will turn out, but neither she nor I will do anything
    <i>stupid</i>. I am afraid that the old religion will <i>once
    again</i> benumb her and freeze her with that damnable icy
    coldness that broke her <i>once before</i>, many years
    ago, <i>to the point of death</i>.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.clergy">Oh, I am no friend of present-day Christianity, though its
    <i>Founder</i> was sublime - I have seen through present-day
    Christianity only too well. That icy coldness hypnotized even
    me, in my youth - but I have taken my revenge since then. How?
    By worshipping the love which <i>they</i>, the theologians,
    call <i>sin</i>, by respecting a whore, etc., and
    <i>not</i> too many <i>would-be</i> respectable, pious ladies.</label>
    To some, <i>woman</i> is <i>heresy</i> and diabolical. To me
    she is just the <i>opposite</i>.</p>

    <p>Regards,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Here you are, from Octave Mouret:</p>

    <p>Mouret dit: &ldquo;Si tu te crois fort, parce que tu refuses
    d'&ecirc;tre b&ecirc;te et de souffrir! Eh bien - alors tu n'es
    qu'une dupe, pas davantage.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Tu t'amuses?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mouret ne parut pas comprendre tout de suite, mais lorsqu'il
    se fut rappel&eacute; leurs conversations anciennes sur la
    b&ecirc;tise vide et l'inutile torture de la vie, il
    r&eacute;pondit: &ldquo;Sans doute - jamais je n'ai tant
    v&eacute;cu... Ah! mon vieux - ne te moques pas! Ce sont les
    heures les plus courtes o&ugrave; l'on meurt de
    souffrance.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Je la veux, je l'aurai... et, s'il [<i>sic</i>] elle
    m'&eacute;chappe tu verras les choses que je ferai pour m'en
    gu&eacute;rir - Tu n'entends pas cette langue, mon vieux;
    autrement tu saurais que l'action contient en elle sa
    r&eacute;compense - agir, cr&eacute;er. Se battre contre les
    faits, <i>les vaincre ou &ecirc;tre vaincu par eux</i>,
    toute la joie et toute la sant&eacute; humaines sont
    <i>l&agrave;</i>!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Simple fa&ccedil;on de s'etourdir, - murmura l'autre.
    &ldquo;Eh bien, j'aime mieux m'&eacute;tourdir - crever pour
    crever - je <i>pr&eacute;f&egrave;re crever de passion, que de
    crever d'ennni</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>[Mourier says: &ldquo;If you think yourself strong because
    you refuse to be stupid and to suffer, well, then you are just
    a fool, that's all.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Are you enjoying yourself?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mouret did not seem to understand immediately, but when he
    remembered their earlier conversation about the empty stupidity
    and the pointless torture of life, he replied, &ldquo;Of course
    - I have never lived so intensely... Ah! old fellow, don't
    scoff! The hours when one dies of suffering are
    shortest.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I want her, I will have her... and - if she escapes
    me then you'll see what I do to be cured of it all. You don't
    understand this language, old fellow; other-wise you would know
    that action is its own reward - to act, to create. To fight
    against the facts, <i>to conquer them or be
    conquered by them, therein</i> lies all human health and
    happiness!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;That's just acting in order to forget&rdquo; -
    muttered the other, &ldquo;Well, I prefer such action - if
    perish we must - <i>I would sooner perish of passion than die
    of boredom</i>.&rdquo; (Emile Zola, Au bonheur des dames)]</p>

    <p>It is not only I who say this quand m&ecirc;me, but
    <i>she,</i> too, and instinctively so, quand m&ecirc;me. That's
    why I saw something grand in her from the very beginning. Only
    it's a confounded pity that she allowed herself to be
    <i>overwhelmed</i> by disappointments <i>in her youth</i>,
    overwhelmed in the sense that her old-fashioned religious
    family <i>felt they had to</i> suppress the <i>active</i>,
    indeed, <i>highly gifted</i> element in her and so rendered her
    <i>passive</i> for evermore. If only they hadn't broken her
    <i>in her youth</i>! Or if they had left it at that instead of
    once again driving her to distraction, and this time with <i>5
    or 6 or even more women fighting against her alone. Just read
    Daudet's L'Evangeliste about those women's intrigues</i>
    - those here were different, yet <i>of the same
    sort.</i></p>

    <p>Oh, Theo, why should I change - I <i>used</i> to be very
    passive and very gentle and quiet - I'm that no longer, but
    then I'm no longer a child either now - sometimes I feel my own
    man.</p>

    <p>Take Mauve, why is he quick-tempered and <i>difficult to get
    on with at times</i>? I haven't come as far as he has, but I,
    too shall go further than I am now.</p>

    <p>I tell you, if one wants to be active, one must not be
    afraid of going wrong, one must not be afraid of making
    mistakes now and then. Many people think that they will become
    good just by doing <i>no harm</i> - but that's a lie, and you
    yourself used to call it that. That way lies stagnation,
    mediocrity.</p>

    <p><i>Just slap anything on</i> when you see a blank canvas
    staring you in the face like some imbecile. You don't know how
    <i>paralyzing</i> that is, that <i>stare</i> of a blank canvas
    is, which says to the painter, <i>You can't do a</i>
    <i>thing</i>. The canvas has an idiotic stare and
    mesmerises some painters so much that they turn into idiots
    themselves. Many painters <i>are afraid</i> in front of the
    blank <i>canvas</i>, but the blank canvas <i>is</i> afraid of
    the real, passionate painter who dares and who has broken the
    spell of `you can't' once and for all.</p>

    <p>Life itself, too, is forever turning an infinitely vacant,
    dispiriting blank side towards man on which <i>nothing</i>
    appears, any more than it does on a blank canvas. But no matter
    <i>how</i> vacant and vain, how <i>dead</i> life may appear to
    be, the man of faith, of energy, of warmth, who knows
    something, will not be put off so easily. He wades in and
    <i>does something</i> and stays with it, in short, he
    <i>violates</i>, &ldquo;<i>defiles&rdquo;</i> - they say. Let
    them talk, those cold theologians.</p>

    <p>Theo, I feel so much confounded pity for this woman, just
    because her age and just <i>possibly</i> a liver and
    gallbladder complaint hang so threateningly over her head. And
    this is aggravated by emotions. For all that, we shall find out
    what can or what, fatally, cannot be done. However I shall not
    do anything without a <i>very good</i> doctor, so <i>I</i>
    shall do her no <i>harm</i>.</p>

    <p>Just because I anticipate that, <i>if</i> our roads should
    lead us to one and the same place, we might have rather strong
    differences of opinion - for that very reason I don't want you
    to be able to hold my dependence on you against me.</p>

    <p>I am still in two minds about what I should try to do, but
    in all probability I shall not be staying on here - and the
    question will then be, where to?</p>

    <p>I don't think you'll be pleased about my coming to Paris -
    but what am I meant to do about that, since you refuse point
    blank to look after my interests - all right, but for my part I
    can't possibly leave things as they are. Had you written less
    peremptorily that it was beneath you, I should never have given
    it a thought, but now - well, now, I must go my own way.</p>

    <p>In short, I have no wish to barter the <i>chance</i> (be it
    no more than a <i>chance</i>) of making my own way for the
    certainty of a patronage that is, apres tout, somewhat
    confining. Since I can see that I am forfeiting my chance of
    selling by continuing to take money from you, we shall just
    have to go our separate ways.</p>

    <p>Don't you think it eminently reasonable that, hearing you
    say that you won't be able to do anything with my work for the
    next few years, I get the feeling that there is a marked
    contrast here, that while you stand on your dignity, I -
    precisely because I don't sell, no matter how hard I work - am
    forced to say, &ldquo;Theo, I am 25 guilders short, couldn't
    you see your way to letting me have a little bit extra?&rdquo;
    Which then proves to be impossible.</p>

    <p>What is so very contrary about you is that when one sends
    you something or one asks, please try to find me an opening
    with the illustrated papers so that I can earn something - one
    hears nothing in reply and <i>you do not lift a finger</i> -
    but one is not allowed to say, I can't manage on the money. Up
    to now, at any rate - but things can't go on like this.</p>

    <p>And I should like to add that I shan't be asking you whether
    you approve or disapprove of anything I do or don't do - I
    shall have no scruples, and if I should feel like going to
    Paris, for example, I shan't ask whether or not you have any
    objection.</p>
