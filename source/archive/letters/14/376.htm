    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half September 1884</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I must write you again to tell you that I have fair hopes
    the patient will recover, though I expect the consequences, in
    the form of nervous trouble, will prove serious and of long
    duration.</p>

    <p>Much, much depends here on her surroundings and her family,
    who, in fact, cannot do her a better turn than to treat her
    kindly, as if nothing had happened, or if they cannot do that,
    just keep silent. Today I have had a long letter from herself,
    and her brother tells me he had also heard from her.</p>

    <p>Dangers are threatening from two sides, Theo - on the one
    hand there may be the formation of a critical nerve disease,
    which may burst out in the form of multiple neuritis or
    encephalitis for instance. On the other hand there is the
    danger of melancholia or religious mania. But now, considering
    that the patient was treated immediately after the first
    symptoms, and that she is in an environment that is on ne peut
    plus suited to bringing a person in her condition around - she
    is the guest, private, of a doctor whom she has known for a
    long time, and his wife - for all these reasons there is reason
    to hope that a crisis in one form or another may be cut short
    or diverted or neutralized by timely intervention - in short,
    that the affair will fizzle out - which fizzling out would take
    the form of her remaining under the present treatment for a
    certain time and then returning, after having calmed down, to
    the usual way of life.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.love">You will understand that the whole thing upsets me greatly
    when I tell you how, in that very letter I received today, she
    says that &ldquo;not one of her family understands her real
    anguish of mind, that she tries to find distraction, but that
    she hardly succeeds in this, and that most of the time sits
    quietly in her room with a book or something or other that she
    has got from me.&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>I am blessed if I know what to do about the B. family - at
    first they were extremely unkind to her - and even on the day
    of her departure they did not act lovingly or even
    good-naturedly, although in point of fact they did not know
    what it was all about. Through her brother I have let her
    sisters know that I was forced to advise them urgently <i>to
    apologize to their sister for their groundless and malicious
    distrust and certain equally unfounded suspicions, which in the
    first place it was untimely for them to express and in the
    second place utterly erroneous and in the third place meant so
    many nails in the patient's coffin</i>. This has been
    efficacious in that first her sister-in-law, Louis's wife, and
    second her sisters sent the patient a letter, the tone of which
    was a great deal more sympathetic and considerably gentler and
    kinder than their first communication. Louis B. himself - the
    only member of the family who knows all the ins and outs of
    that poisoning - although the others have their suspicions, but
    are regularly contradicted by me and Louis, who should know
    more about it - Louis B. on his part has from the first behaved
    practically, manfully and sympathetically toward her.</p>

    <p>And as for you, if it should happen that one of the
    suspicious ones should try to pump you about the suicide
    attempt, well, don't let on that you have the slightest idea of
    it. But for that matter, I don't think anybody will - except
    <i>perhaps</i> Father and Mother.</p>

    <p>You do understand, don't you, that, although I wrote you it
    reminded me of a passage in Madame Bovary, there is nothing
    here that had anything to do with the <i>second</i> Mme.
    Bovary, who is really the heroine of the book, but only of the
    <i>first</i> Mme. Bovary, of whom there is little more than how
    and why she died on hearing bad news about her fortune.</p>

    <p><i>Here</i> the cause of the desperation was not bad news
    concerning her fortune, but the way in which they reproached
    her, telling her that she was <i>too old</i> and that sort of
    thing. Well, within a short time, probably in a fortnight or
    three weeks, it will be decided whether or not a dangerous
    nerve disease will break out.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, I am still quite upset by it. Don't speak about it
    to Father and Mother.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
