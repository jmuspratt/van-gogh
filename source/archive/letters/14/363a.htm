  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Because it may be that you did not quite understand what I
    asked you at the time, and in order to exclude the possibility
    that later on there might be a misunderstanding, I will say it
    again.</p>

    <p>Late in January or in the beginning of February I wrote you
    that, on coming home, it suddenly became only too clear to me
    that the money I was in the habit of receiving from you was
    looked upon in the first place as something absolutely
    uncertain, <i>precarious</i> - and secondly as something in the
    nature of what I will call charity for a poor fool.</p>

    <p>And at the same time I could establish the fact that this
    idea was communicated to persons who had absolutely nothing to
    do with it - for instance, the respectable natives of these
    regions - and further that I was asked three times in one week
    by absolute strangers, &ldquo;Why is it you never sell your
    work?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>To this must be added the fact that last summer, because of
    your making me feel the bridle a little in order to impress
    upon me that it was in my interest to be compliant in some
    things, I had already made up my mind to let you feel in return
    that I for my part, if I were inconvenienced by too much
    tugging at the bridle, <i>should be quite willing to leave the
    bridle in your hands, as long as I was not attached to the
    other end</i>, or in other words - if I am not free in my
    private life, I decline the subsidy. In short, that whether I
    should be able to get along financially would depend on my
    <i>work</i> (<i>and not on my private life</i>), at least as
    far as the 150 francs a month was concerned.</p>

    <p>Summing up these and similar things, I said in my letter of
    the end of January that I should be unwilling to go on in the
    same way as up to then, that is to say, <i>without</i> a
    definite agreement.</p>

    <p>That however I should be willing to - nay, glad to - nothing
    could be more pleasant to me than to go on in the same way on
    condition that a definite agreement was made about the supply
    of work. And that in order to make a trial I should send a
    number of things toward the beginning of March.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">Your reply was evasive, it certainly was not
    straightforward, I mean it was not something like this:
    &ldquo;Vincent, I see the reasonableness of a number of your
    grievances, and I approve of your proposal to make an agreement
    that every month you will send me a number of drawings that you
    consider equal in value to the 150 francs I am in the habit of
    sending you, so that you will be able to look upon this money
    as earned money.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Most positively I noticed that you did not simply write
    something like this!</label></p>

    <p>Well, I thought, towards the beginning of March I shall send
    him some things and wait for the result. Then I sent you nine
    watercolours and five pen drawings, I wrote you I had yet a
    sixth pen drawing and <art id=0034>the painted study of the old tower</art>,
    which at the time you said you were eager for.</p>

    <p>But now that I see that your expressions remain <i>as vague
    as ever</i>, I cannot but tell you without reserve that I do
    not consider this the way to treat me.</p>

    <p>As for my work - up to now it seemed incontrovertible that
    you would rather I did not send anything than that I did.</p>

    <p>If this is still the case - well then, I am of the opinion
    that <i>either</i> I am not worth your protection, <i>or</i> you think
    a little too frivolously of my work. <i>I have never
    withdrawn</i> my proposal to send you my work regularly.</p>

    <p>When I mention that I desire to look upon the 150 francs, or
    more or less as the case may be, as equal in value to what I
    send you, this is <i>to a certain extent</i> quite a private
    matter, and in no way do we touch upon the question whether my
    work has commercial value or not.</p>

    <p>But in that case I shall be more justified in the eyes of
    Tom, Dick and Harry, and shall not have to put up with being
    reproached with idling away my time - or even being
    <i>absolutely</i> looked upon as &ldquo;having <i>no</i> means
    of subsistence.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>At the same time it is proof on your part of your confidence
    in my future, which, however, I shall most certainly not extort
    from you - and I repeat that however you may decide in this
    matter, it will have no influence on my opinion of the past,
    and that I shall never ignore your help during these years, but
    on the contrary, appreciate it highly.</p>

    <p>But you will have to decide quite independently whether our
    relations will be continued in the future or not - for instance
    during the current year.</p>

    <p>However, I end with the assurance that in case you refuse to
    accept my proposal to send you my work regularly (you can do or
    not do whatever you like with it, at least as far as doing
    business with it is concerned, but at all events I insist on
    your showing it from time to time, as you did at the very
    beginning, and in my opinion rightly so), I shall carry through
    the separation - so <i>either</i> this alteration - <i>or
    else</i> finished.</p>

    <p>All yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I did not send you the sixth pen drawing because, just as I
    insist on your showing my work now and then, I am going to show
    Rappard something once in a while - as he knows a lot of people
    - and that drawing was at Rappard's, and I should have had it
    back, but up to now he has kept it, along with <art id=1130>two other pen
    drawings</art>, <art id=1128>&ldquo;Winter Garden.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>Well, and as to the painted study, I said a few words in my
    previous letter to the effect that I felt discouraged about
    sending it, because you did not think the one from Drenthe any
    good, and I do not think this one would please you either. If I
    can trust my memory, there are some among those made in Drenthe
    which I should do in exactly the same way if I had to do them
    all over again. As for the current month I already have the
    following drawings, which under other circumstances I should
    have sent you in April:</p>

    <p><art id=1133>Winter garden</art> - <art id=1240>pollard birches</art>
     - <art id=1239>poplar avenue</art> - <art id=1135>kingfisher</art>.</p>

    <p>[Further enclosed in this letter]</p>

    <p>Another thing I should not want to hear later on is that
    what I call an agreement about this or that should be ascribed
    to my interpretation instead of being considered the intention
    of the other party - in other words, you. You know that you
    told me that C. M. said something of the sort about me to you.
    From this I learned how important it is to dot my <i>i's</i>
    and cross my <i>t's</i> in the matter of agreements.</p>

    <p>I think - seeing that in the past I repeatedly wrote you
    about the proposed alteration, and that now I have given a
    summary of it all - everything has been explained sufficiently
    clearly, and I am now entitled to a plain Yes or a plain
    No.</p>

    <p>[Another postscript obviously written after the receipt of a
    letter from Theo]</p>

    <p>I want to say a few words with regard to your letter about
    my drawings - which you say I have interpreted in a most
    extravagant way.</p>

    <p>What I say is:</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li value="1">
        <p>Among the things you told me there were a few of which
        the purport was that in tone and sentiment there were some
        particulars that pleased you - well, all the better - if
        you like it, I shall say, I am delighted to hear it.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="2">
        <p>In the letter there is a comparison between Millet's and
        Lhermitte's methods. In what you said about Millet I found
        better and more sensitive expressions than I am accustomed
        to from you - however, this was overshadowed by the manner
        in which you said that now you were sick of Lhermitte
        again, and what I should like to say about your whole
        dissertation is: <i>Tu files ton coton trop fin</i>, you
        are cutting it too fine. Why not take a broader view of it
        all, and feel one and the same enthusiasm for them both
        (who bear the same relation to each other as Rembrandt to
        Maes, as I see it), without getting engrossed in
        hair-splitting casuistry about who is the greater man?</p>
      </li>

      <li value="3">
        <p>Something was missing from the letter - namely a reply
        to the question of whether we should go on or not.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The question was urgent, and as my work is dependent on my
    colours and tools - to an extent which I cannot ignore - and
    these again on my receiving or not receiving money, it is
    impossible for me to consider your letter very useful.</p>

    <p>It would be less impossible for me to keep my temper in our
    correspondence if, when on the critical date you have not got
    the money, you should write, I haven't got it, you will get it
    on such and such a date. Now you did not write a single word in
    response to my saying, I am surprised that - taking into
    consideration that you told me I could get the money by return
    mail if I wanted it, and my having told you that I would rather
    have it at once than later - I have not heard anything about
    it.</p>

    <p>If you had written at the time, I am sorry, but I haven't
    got it, I should not have tortured my brain with thoughts such
    as that you commit this negligence <i>on purpose</i> in order
    to make life a little more difficult for me. And - if you
    haven't got the money, I cannot reproach you with anything -
    but if you <i>neglect</i> sending it - on purpose or not on
    purpose, that does not matter - then it is something I wish you
    would unlearn - something that forces one to lose one's
    temper.</p>

    <p>What I said about my trying to do something with my work for
    instance in Antwerp - this is definitely my intention - and I
    should assuredly not accept but reject your letter, if in
    addition you had not also written: [Here an ink line points to
    the passage beginning &ldquo;I am not conscious
    of&hellip;&rdquo; at the end of the paragraph following the
    sketch below]</p>

    <p>Your present frame of mind about me, and my frame of mind
    about you, is cool enough to allow for coolly asking questions
    and coolly answering them.</p>

    <p>So to cut matters short - leaving caring for each other or
    not out of it - can I count on it that there is a definite
    agreement for one year that in exchange for the work I shall
    supply you, I shall go on receiving the usual monthly amount?
    The reason why I have to know this is that, if I can definitely
    count on it, I shall get a more spacious apology of a studio
    somewhere, a studio I need in order to work from the model.</p>

    <p>The one I have at present has the following geographical
    situation:</p>

    <p><?showImage("433_V-T_363a0");?>
     Studio immediately adjoining coal hole, sewers and dung pit,
    and my imagination is not strong enough to see this an
    <i>advance</i> on last year's situation. However, this does not
    alter the fact that, as soon as I complain about something, I
    find passages in your letters like &ldquo;I (Theo) am of the
    opinion that now your situation is better than last
    summer&rdquo; - you see? And I also draw the little ground plan
    in answer to your expression, &ldquo;I am not conscious
    of,&rdquo; etc.</p>

    <p>To this I have to say, I am indifferent to your being
    conscious or not conscious of the fact that there is something
    wrong with this or that - at least as long as you do not demand
    that I should go about anesthetized on the point, and as long
    as you provide me with the means of correcting things that are
    wrong I haven't the slightest objection to your being
    &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; of all manner of things.</p>

    <p>I hope this letter is as cool as your own - and I thank you
    very much for the money sent - which makes up for a good deal -
    at least makes up for all the other things, because I can now
    count on its continuing for a year, and I shall make no
    additional demands on you, and shall be delighted to send you
    my work.</p>

    <p><i>And</i> there is one little thing I should like to add to
    this: if I should succeed in selling anything in Antwerp or
    elsewhere, I shall inform you, and the amount will be deducted
    from the 150 francs.</p>

    <p>I never write Rappard about business matters - at least I
    have not told him that the terms we have been on lately were
    not as good as before.</p>

    <p>Now please think over whether it is right that you, who know
    Rappard, have seen nothing of his work, and have not the
    remotest idea what he is about - that you do not take the
    slightest notice of him any more, unless perhaps from hearsay,
    when I tell you something. For all that he is one of the
    fellows who will make their influence felt - whom they will
    have to reckon with - of whose work they will be obliged to
    take notice. At one time Rappard came to you, and felt small in
    your presence because you knew so much about art. Since that
    year he spent in Paris - what enormous progress he has made! -
    but you - haven't you been resting on your laurels a
    little??</p>

    <p>[On a separate leaf in this letter]</p>

    <p>Your letter about Millet contains good passages, indicating
    a better insight than what you say about Lhermitte, toward whom
    you might continue to feel sympathetic, I think. Do not lose
    yourself in that absolutely sterile twaddle about who is first,
    and who is second, and so on - that is nothing but nonsense,
    and stupid. There are plenty who do this; you be one of those
    who think Millet very beautiful and Lhermitte too, so that no
    room is left for idiotically pondering on who is <i>the
    best</i>, who is <i>the first</i> - they are both <i>above the
    average level</i>. What would be the use of drawing comparisons
    between Rembrandt and Nicolaes Maes or Van der Meer? -
    nonsense, isn't it? - so stop it.</p>

    <p>I have this question to put to you about Millet. Do you
    happen to think that Millet would have become Millet if he had
    lived without children and without a wife? It was all the
    easier for him to find his inspiration, his feeling for the
    simple people was so much purer and deeper, because he himself
    lived in the way a labourer's family lives - but with
    infinitely more feeling than the common labourer. Millet's
    maxim was, God blesses big families - and his life shows that
    he meant this, because it was in harmony with what he said.</p>

    <p>Would Millet have been able to do without Sensier? Perhaps
    not. Why did Millet break with those men who were his friends
    at first, and from whom he nevertheless received an annuity?
    Sensier gives enough particular to suggest that the basic
    trouble was that they thought Millet personally a mediocrity
    and his work mediocre, and annoyed themselves and Millet with
    it until at long last the pitcher broke. Yet Sensier does not
    give a detailed account of the happenings in those days, as if
    he understood that Millet thought that time a period of
    execrable bother, and preferred not to be reminded of it.
    Somewhere Sensier says, When Millet thought of his first wife
    and the worries of those days, he clasped his head with both
    hands in a gesture as if once again he were overwhelmed by the
    huge darkness and unutterable melancholy of that period.</p>

    <p>The second time his family life succeeded better - but then
    he was no longer in contact with those big fellows.</p>
