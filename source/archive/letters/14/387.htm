  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I suppose you already know that Father has refused the
    living at Helvoirt.</p>

    <p>I was not indifferent to the decision, as in no case would I
    have gone with them to Helvoirt, and would either have stayed
    here in my studio or gone to Antwerp. Now, as far as I can see,
    it is, and will be, best for me simply to go on as I am, and to
    stay here.</p>

    <p>Recently I really haven't been doing so badly. It is true
    that I can't have any financial success with my work here, but
    I am making really good friends here, who I believe will become
    even better.</p>

    <p>Last week I painted still life day after day with the people
    who paint at Eindhoven.</p>

    <p>That new acquaintance, the tanner whom I told you about,
    applies himself wonderfully. But I, for my part, must do
    something in return to keep up the friendship. But I don't see
    that I am the loser by it, as I work with more animation when I
    have some conversation.</p>

    <p>Hermans has so many beautiful things, old jars and other
    antiques, that I want to ask you if I could oblige you by
    painting for your room a still life of some of these objects,
    for instance of Gothic things - those I have done with Hermans
    up to now are simpler in character. But just today he told me
    that if I wanted to paint for myself a picture of things that
    were still too difficult for him, I could take them with me to
    the studio. Please give me an answer to this, and if you like,
    I shall make one for you, and will pick out the best things. I
    have finished a little one already. As to my asking you to send
    me another 20 francs before the end of this month, I hope you
    will do so.</p>

    <p>I am getting on pretty well, but my expenses are not getting
    smaller; but by working very hard now, I am making
    progress.</p>

    <p>Do help me by sending what I ask if it is at all possible.
    Otherwise these last days of the month will be very hard for me
    and the work will suffer more than is necessary.</p>

    <p>And I will give it back to you in my work. That's all I can
    say about it.</p>

    <p>At all events, I will ask for those things of Hermans' and
    make something for you; you will see for yourself what I told
    you about the colour, that it is improving. I have also started
    another watercolour of the water mill [F 1144a, JH 523]</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I know that it is a hard time for you, but we must push on,
    and sure enough there will be a change for the better.</p>
