  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for what you sent me. I appreciate your having done
    so, because so much depends on my working hard during those
    winter months when it is easier to get models.</p>

    <p>In two or three days you will receive twelve little
    pen-and-ink drawings after studies of heads.</p>

    <p>After all I feel most in my element when I am working on the
    figure, and there also seems to me to be more character in, for
    instance, those heads I already did in The Hague, and in some
    other figures, than in the other things I did. And perhaps it
    will be wise to concentrate more exclusively on the figure.</p>

    <p>But the figure always stands in some surroundings, and one
    can't help doing those surroundings too, because one can't
    dispense with them.</p>

    <p>Mother wants to add something to this letter, so I will be
    brief, as I shall send you those pen drawings one of these
    days.</p>

    <p>I don't yet know what I shall do with those heads, but I
    want to extract the motif from the characters themselves.</p>

    <p>But I know quite well why I made them, and what in general I
    have in mind. I am longing to see, sooner or later, that
    picture which you received. [A painting by the Swedish painter
    Josephson - a study for his later famous painting &ldquo;The
    Waternix&rdquo;.]</p>

    <p>I don't understand exactly what the legend itself means.</p>

    <p>I don't understand it because you say the figure is
    Dante-esque, but it is the symbol of an evil spirit luring
    people into the abyss.</p>

    <p>Surely these two things can hardly go together, for the
    sober, severe figure of Dante, full of indignation and protest
    against what he had seen happening, protesting against the
    terrible medieval abuses and prejudices, is certainly one of
    the most sincere, honest, noble ones imaginable. It was said of
    Dante, &ldquo;Voil&agrave; celui qui va &agrave; l'enfer et qui
    en revient&rdquo;; <i>entering it and coming back again</i> is
    quite different from the devilish <i>luring others into
    it</i>.</p>

    <p>Consequently, a Dante-esque figure cannot be made to act a
    satanic part without the greatest misconstruction of
    character.</p>

    <p>And the silhouette of a Mephisto is mighty different from
    that of Dante.</p>

    <p>Contemporaries wrote of Giotto, &ldquo;Le premier il mit `la
    bont&eacute;' dans l'expression des t&ecirc;tes humains.&rdquo;
    [Primarily he put `goodness' into the expression of human
    heads.] Giotto painted Dante, and with much sentiment, as you
    know, for you remember the old portrait. From which I conclude
    that Dante's expression, however sad and melancholy it may be,
    is essentially an expression of something infinitely good and
    tender. So I cannot imagine Satan or Mephisto having anything
    Dante-esque about them. All the more reason why I am curious to
    see, someday what the picture is really like.</p>

    <p>My best wishes for the New Year.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
