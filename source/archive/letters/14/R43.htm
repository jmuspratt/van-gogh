  <body>
    <p>Dear friend Rappard,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter, which I was pleased to get. I
    was very glad to hear that you saw something in my
    drawings.</p>

    <p>I shan't enter into generalities concerning technique, but I
    certainly foresee that as I gain more of what I shall call
    expressive force, people will say not <i>less</i> but
    <i>even</i> more than they do now that I have <i>no</i>
    technique.</p>

    <p>Hence I absolutely agree with you that what I am saying in
    my present work will have to be said more <i>forcefully</i>,
    and I am working hard to strengthen that aspect, but - that the
    general public will understand me better <i>when I do</i> -
    no.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">That doesn't alter the fact that, in my view, the reasoning
    of the artless fellow who asked of your work, &ldquo;Does he
    paint for money?&rdquo; is the reasoning of a bloody idiot,
    since this intelligent creature evidently considers it
    axiomatic that originality prevents one from making money with
    one's work. Trying to pass this off as an <i>axiom,</i>
    <i>because</i> it can decidedly <i>not</i> be proved as a
    <i>proposition</i>, is, as I said, a common trick of bloody
    idiots and idle little Jesuits.</label></p>

    <p>Do you really think I don't care about technique or that I
    don't try for it? Oh, but I do, although only inasmuch as it
    allows me to say what I want to say (and if I cannot do that
    yet, or not yet perfectly, I am working hard to improve), but I
    don't give a damn whether my language matches that of the
    rhetoricians (you remember making the comparison: if someone
    had something useful, true and necessary to say but said it in
    terms that were hard to understand, what good would that be to
    the speaker or to his audience?).</p>

    <p>Let me just hold on to this point - the more so as I have
    often come across a rather peculiar historical phenomenon.
    Don't misunderstand me: it goes without saying that one must
    speak in the mother tongue of one's audience, if that audience
    knows one language only, and it would be absurd not to take
    that for granted.</p>

    <p>But now for the second part of the question. Suppose a man
    has something to say and says it in a language in which his
    audience, too, is at home. Time and again we shall find that
    the <i>speaker</i> of <i>truth</i> lacks <i>oratorical
    style</i> and does <i>not</i> appeal to the g<i>reater part</i>
    of his audience, indeed, is scorned as a man &ldquo;slow of
    tongue&rdquo; and <i>despised</i> as such. He can count himself
    lucky if he can edify just one, or at best a very few, with
    what he says, because those few are not interested in
    oratorical tirades, but positively listen out for the true,
    useful, necessary content of the words, which enlighten them,
    broaden their minds, make them freer or more intelligent.</p>

    <p>And now for the painters - is it the object and the
    &ldquo;non plus ultra&rdquo; of art to produce those peculiar
    smudges of colour, that waywardness in the drawing - that are
    known as the refinement of technique? Certainly not. Take a
    Corot, a Daubigny, a Dupr&eacute;, a Millet or an Isra&euml;ls
    - men who are certainly the great forerunners - well, their
    work goes <i>beyond the paint</i>, standing out from that of
    the fashionable crowd as much as an oratorical tirade by, say,
    a Numa Roumestan differs from a prayer or a good poem.</p>

    <p>So the reason why <i>one must</i> work on one's technique is
    simply to express better, more accurately, more profoundly what
    one feels, and the less verbiage the better. As for the rest,
    one need not bother with it.</p>

    <p>Why I say this is because I think I have noticed that you
    sometimes disapprove of things in your own work which in my
    opinion are rather good. In my view, <i>your</i> technique is
    better than, say, Haverman's, because your brushstroke often
    has an individual, distinctive, reasoned and deliberate touch,
    while what one invariably gets with Haverman is convention,
    redolent at all times of the <i>studio</i>, and never of
    nature.</p>

    <p>For instance, those sketches of yours I saw, the little
    weaver and the Terschelling women, appeal to me, they are a
    stab at the core of things. All I get with Haverman is a
    feeling of malaise and boredom, little else.</p>

    <p>I am afraid that you - and I <i>congratulate</i> you on it -
    are going to hear the same remarks about your technique in the
    future <i>as well</i>, and about your subjects and . . . about
    everything, in fact, even when that brushstroke of yours, which
    has so much character already, acquires still more of it.
    <i>Yet there are</i> art lovers who, apr&eacute;s tout,
    appreciate most what has been painted with emotion. Although we
    no longer live in the days of Thor&eacute; and Th&eacute;ophile
    Gautier, alas.</p>

    <p>Just consider whether it is sensible to talk a great deal
    about technique nowadays. You will say that I myself am doing
    just that - as a matter of fact, I regret it. But as far as I
    am concerned, I am determined, <i>even</i> when I shall be much
    more master of my brush than I am now - to go on telling people
    methodically <i>that I cannot paint</i>. Do you understand?
    <i>Even when</i> I have achieved a solid manner of my own, more
    complete and concise than the present one.</p>

    <p>I liked what Herkomer said when he opened up his own art
    school to a number of people <i>who already knew how to
    paint</i> - he urged his students to be kind enough <i>not</i>
    to paint the way he did but in their own way. &ldquo;My
    aim,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to set original forms free, not
    to recruit disciples for Herkomer's <i>doctrine.</i>&rdquo;
    Entre lions on ne singe pas. [Lions do not ape one
    another.]</p>

    <p>Anyway, I've been painting quite a bit lately, a seated girl
    winding shuttles for the weavers and a weaver on his own. I'm
    rather anxious that you should see my painted studies one of
    these days - not because I'm satisfied with them but because I
    think they'll convince you that I really am keeping my hand in,
    and that when I say that I set relatively little store by
    technique, it's not because I'm trying to save myself trouble
    or to avoid problems, for that is not my way.</p>

    <p>Apart from that, I am looking forward to your getting to
    know this corner of Brabant some day - in my opinion it is much
    more beautiful than the Breda side.</p>

    <p>These last few days it has been delightful. There is a
    village here, <i>Son en Breughel</i>, which bears an amazing
    resemblance to Courri&egrave;res, where the Bretons live -
    though the figures are even more beautiful over there. As one's
    love for the form grows, one may well come to dislike the
    &ldquo;Dutch national costume,&rdquo; as it's called in the
    photograph albums they sell to foreigners.</p>

    <p>I detest writing or talking about <i>technique</i> in
    general, Rappard - though I may occasionally get the urge none
    the less to discuss how to execute some idea or other of mine,
    be it with you or with someone else, and I never make light if
    the practical value of such discussions. But that doesn't
    gainsay my first thought - which I may not have expressed
    properly.</p>

    <p>That thought, I can't find the right words, is based not on
    something negative but on something positive. On the positive
    awareness that art is something greater and higher than our own
    skill or knowledge or learning. That art is something which,
    though produced by human hands, is not wrought by hands alone,
    but wells up from a deeper source, from man's soul, while much
    of the proficiency and technical expertise associated with art
    reminds me of what would be called self-righteousness in
    religion.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">My strongest sympathies in the literary as well as in the
    artistic field are with those artists in whom I see the soul at
    work most strongly - Isra&euml;ls, for example, is clever as a
    technician, but so is Vollon - but I like Isra&euml;ls more
    than Vollon because I see something more in Isra&euml;ls,
    something quite different from the masterly reproduction of the
    materials, something quite different from light and brown,
    something quite different from the colour - yet that something
    quite different is achieved by the precise rendering of the
    light effect, the material, the colour.</label></p>

    <p>This something different of which I find so much more in
    Isra&euml;ls than in Vollon is pronounced in Eliot, and Dickens
    has it as well. Does it lie in their choice of subjects?
    <i>No</i>, for that, too, is only an <i>effect</i>.</p>

    <p>What I am driving at, among other things, is that while
    Eliot is masterly in her execution, above and beyond that she
    also has a genius all of her own, about which I would say,
    perhaps one improves through reading those books, or perhaps
    these books have the power to make one sit up and take
    notice.</p>

    <p>In spite of myself I keep writing about exhibitions, though
    actually I give them precious little thought. Now that by
    chance I do happen to be thinking about them, I am examining my
    thoughts with some surprise. I should not be expressing them
    fully enough if I didn't add that in some pictures there is
    something so thoroughly honest and good that no matter what is
    done with them - whether they end up in good or in bad, in
    honest or dishonest hands - something good emanates from them.
    &ldquo;Let your light shine before men,&rdquo; is, I believe,
    the duty of every painter, but in my view does not mean that
    letting the light shine before men must be done through
    exhibitions. Believe me, I just wish there were <i>more</i> and
    <i>better</i> opportunities than exhibitions to bring art to
    the people. Far from wanting to hide the light under a bushel,
    I would sooner let it be seen. Well, enough of this.</p>

    <p>I have recently been reading Eliot's Felix Holt, the
    Radical. This book has been very well translated into Dutch. I
    hope you know it. If you don't, see if you can get hold of it.
    It somewhere contains certain views of life that I find
    outstandingly good - profound things expressed in a droll way.
    It is a book written with great verve, and various scenes are
    described as Frank Holl or someone similar might have drawn
    them. The way of thinking and the outlook are similar. There
    are not many writers as utterly sincere and good as Eliot. This
    book, The Radical, is not as well known in Holland as, say, her
    Adam Bede, and her Scenes from Clerical Life are not all that
    well known either - more's the pity, much as it's a great pity
    that not everyone knows Isra&euml;ls's work.</p>

    <p>I am enclosing a little booklet on Corot, which I believe
    you will read with pleasure if you don't know it already. It
    contains a number of accurate biographical details. I saw the
    exhibition at the time for which this is the catalogue.</p>

    <p>It's remarkable, I think, that this man should have taken so
    long to settle down and mature. Just look what he did at
    different periods of his life. I saw things in the first of his
    <i>real</i> contributions - the result of years of study - that
    were as honest as the day is long, thoroughly sound - but how
    people must have despised them! For me Corot's <i>studies</i>
    were a lesson when I saw them, and I was even then struck by
    the difference between them and the studies of many other
    landscape painters. I would compare <i>your</i> little country
    churchyard with them, if I didn't find <i>more technique</i> in
    it than in Corot's studies. The sentiment is identical, an
    endeavour to render only what is intimate and essential.</p>

    <p>The gist of what I am saying in this letter is this. Let us
    try to grasp the secrets of technique so well that people will
    be taken in and swear by all that is holy that we have no
    technique. Let our work be so savant [skillful] that it
    <i>seems</i> naive and does not reek of our cleverness. I do
    <i>not</i> believe that <i>I</i> have reached this desirable
    point, and I do not believe that even <i>you</i>, who are more
    advanced than I, have reached it yet.</p>

    <p>I hope you'll see something more than verbal nitpicking in
    this letter.</p>

    <p>I believe that the more contact one has with nature herself
    the more deeply one delves into her, the less attracted one is
    by all the trucs d'atelier [studio tricks] and yet I do want to
    give them their due and <i>watch</i> them painting. I often
    look forward to visiting studios myself.</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Niet in boeken heb ik het gevonden<br>

    En van &ldquo;geleerden&rdquo; - och, weinig geleerd.<br>

    <p></p>

    [Not in books have I found it<br>

    And from the &ldquo;learned,&rdquo; ah, but little have I
    learned]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>says De Genestet, as you know. By way of a variation one
    might say,</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Niet in `t atelier heb ik gevonden<br>

    En van de schilders/de kenners - och, weinig geleerd.<br>

    <p></p>

    [Not in the studio have I found it,<br>

    and from painters/connoisseurs, ah, but little have I
    learned.]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>Perhaps you are shocked to find me putting in painters or
    connoisseurs indiscriminately.</p>

    <p>But to change the subject, it is fiendishly difficult not to
    feel anything, not to be affected when those bloody idiots say
    &ldquo;does he paint for money?&rdquo; One hears that drivel
    day in, day out, and one gets angry with oneself later for
    having taken it to heart. That's how it is with me - and I
    think it must be much the same with you. One doesn't really
    care a rap, but it gets on one's nerves all the same, just like
    listening to off-key singing or being <i>pursued by a malicious
    barrel organ</i>. Don't you find that to be true of the barrel
    organ, and that it always seems to have picked on you in
    particular? For wherever one goes, it's the same old tune.</p>

    <p>As for me, I'm going to do what I tell you: when people say
    something or other to me, I shall finish their sentences even
    before they are out - in the same way as I treat someone I know
    to be in the habit of extending his finger to me instead of his
    hand (I tried the trick on a venerable colleague of my father's
    yesterday) - I too have a single finger ready and, with an
    absolutely straight face, carefully touch his with it when we
    shake hands, in such a way that the man <i>cannot</i> take
    exception, yet realizes that I am giving as good as I damned
    well got. The other day I put a fellow's back up with something
    similar. Does one lose anything as a result? No, for to be
    sure, such people are sent to try us, and when I write to you
    about certain expressions of yours I do so only in order to ask
    you: are you certain that those who are so loud in their
    praises of technique are de bonne foi? [of good faith] I'm only
    asking because <i>I know that your aim is to avoid studio
    chic</i>.</p>
