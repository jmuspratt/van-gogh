  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">I just wanted to drop you a line while you are in London.</label>
    Thanks for your last letter, and the enclosed 150 francs.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">How I should love to walk with you in London, particularly
    in real London weather when the City, especially in certain old
    parts near the river, has aspects that are very melancholy but
    at the same time have a remarkably striking character, which
    some present-day English artists have begun to make after they
    learned to observe and paint from the French.</label> But unfortunately
    it is very difficult to get to see that English art which is
    really the most interesting to you and me. Generally
    <i>most</i> of the pictures in the exhibitions are <i>not</i>
    sympathetic.</p>

    <p>I hope, however, that you will come across things here and
    there which will make you understand. Now I for my part have
    always remembered some English pictures such as &ldquo;Chill
    October&rdquo; by Millais and, for instance, the drawings by
    Fred. Walker and Pinwell. Just notice the Hobbema in the
    National Gallery; you must not forget a few very beautiful
    Constables there, including &ldquo;Cornfield,&rdquo; nor that
    other one in South Kensington called &ldquo;Valley
    Farm.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I am very curious to hear what struck you most, and what you
    have seen there.</p>

    <p><?showImage("445_V-T_3740");?>
     Last week I was in the fields every day during the harvest, of
    which I made a composition.</p>

    <p>I made this for somebody in Eindhoven who wants to decorate
    a dining room [Hermans]. He intended to do this with
    compositions of various <i>saints</i>. I begged him to consider
    whether the appetite of the worthy people who would have to sit
    down at that table would not be more stimulated by six
    illustrations from peasant life in the Meierij [Manor
    District], at the same time symbolizing the four seasons, than
    by these mystical personages. And now, after a visit to my
    studio, the man became quite enthusiastic about it.</p>

    <p>But he wants to paint those panels himself, and will he be
    able to do it? (But I should design and paint the compositions
    on a reduced scale.)</p>

    <p>He is a man with whom I want to remain on good terms - a
    former goldsmith who has three times amassed a very important
    collection of antiques and sold it again. He is rich now, and
    has built himself a house that is again full of antiques, and
    furnished with some very beautiful oaken chests, etc. He is
    decorating the ceilings and walls himself, and really does it
    well sometimes. But he positively wants &ldquo;painting&rdquo;
    in the dining room, and has begun to paint twelve panels of
    flowers.</p>

    <p>There are six panels left on the longest wall, and for these
    I gave him preliminary sketches of a sower, ploughman,
    shepherd, harvest, potato digging, ox wagon in the snow.</p>

    <p>But I don't know whether it will come to anything, for I
    have no definite arrangement with him.</p>

    <p>But he is pleased with this first panel, as well as with my
    sketches for the other subjects.</p>

    <p>I long very much for your coming.</p>

    <p>I am still pleased to be here; at times I do not miss some
    things, but my work absorbs me sufficiently.</p>

    <p>Well, remember me to Mr. O. [Obach] if you bump into
    him.</p>

    <p>When you come here, you will find all the farmers ploughing
    and sowing spurry, or they will have just finished doing
    it.</p>

    <p>I have seen splendid sunsets over the fields of stubble.</p>

    <p>Goodbye for now.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
