    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>According to my promise I am writing you again, now that the
    doctor has been here again. The first night has been very
    quiet, and seeing that much depends on quiet, the doctor was
    very satisfied.</p>

    <p>We asked him again to tell us plainly what it was, and it is
    a fact that the thighbone is broken right beneath the
    joint.</p>

    <p>You know that I was just going to pay off some debts with
    the money you sent. But as there will be many extra expenses,
    of course I told Father he was welcome to use it; the other
    things can wait, and it was only by chance that I had not yet
    sent it off. I am afraid it will be a long time before Mother
    recovers.</p>

    <p>With a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p><i>Saturday morning</i><i>.</i></p>

    <p>I can tell you that this night has also passed quietly, and
    Mother has slept pretty well. She sends you her love. But it
    will last some time, brother, before everything is all right
    again.</p>

    <p>Theo, think it over well, if you cannot find some way or
    other for me to earn something. Money will be needed, and we
    must also consider once more the chances of selling my work. If
    it were only possible for me to pay my working expenses myself,
    so that you could give Mother what you would otherwise give
    me.</p>

    <p>I told you already that I am doing watercolours of the
    weavers here. I shall try to finish some. But I cannot give all
    my time to them, and I must be at home as much as possible, at
    least these first days. Well, as soon as the doctor has come
    again today, I shall send you a postcard. Goodbye.</p>
