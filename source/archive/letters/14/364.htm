  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I just received your letter and enclosed 250 francs. <label content="business.selling">If I
    may consider your letter an answer to my proposal, I can indeed
    agree to what you say. In short, to avoid further discussion or
    quarreling, in order to have some answer when those leading
    ordinary lives accuse me of being without any &ldquo;source of
    income,&rdquo; I want to consider the money I receive from you
    as money I have earned.</p>

    <p>Of course I will send you <i>my work every month</i>. As you
    say, that work will be your property then, and I perfectly
    agree with you that you have every right to do anything with
    it; even I couldn't make any objection if you should want to
    tear it to pieces.</label></p>

    <p>I, for my part, needing money, am obliged to accept it, even
    if somebody said to me, &ldquo;I want to put that drawing of
    yours away, or I want to throw it in the fire, you can get so
    much money for it&rdquo;; under the circumstances I should say,
    &ldquo;All right, give me the money, there is my work, I want
    to get on.&rdquo; I must have money, in order to get on; I try
    to get it, and therefore - even if you were completely
    indifferent to me - as long as I get your monthly allowance,
    without conditions forbidding me to do certain things, I will
    not break with you, and I agree to everything if need be.</p>

    <p>My way of considering you and your money matches your way of
    considering me and my work - and as long as the balance is kept
    - I agree to it. If I receive money from you and you receive
    drawings or paintings from me, and if I have something to
    justify myself in the eyes of the world, though we might have
    nothing else in common, though we should write and speak about
    nothing, even then I feel satisfied for the moment, and I agree
    to it completely.</p>

    <p>Even if it should be your high pleasure to tear up my work,
    or maybe leave it peacefully alone, or if you should try to do
    something with it, I have no right to find fault with you.
    <i>But only if I am allowed to consider it a purchase on your
    part</i>.</p>

    <p>Be so kind as to inform me what abusive term I used with
    reference to your friend Braat in my last letter.</p>

    <p>As far as I can remember there is nothing in it about Braat
    except the remark that during the months I spent at Goupil
    &amp; Co.'s in Paris, I already thought him in poor health. If
    my memory does not deceive me, we were often in each other's
    company, and I fail to understand what gives you the impression
    that I &ldquo;do not like him very much.&rdquo; So many years
    have passed since then, and my life has changed so much in
    these years that the people I knew in those days have left no
    more than rather vague and effaced pictures in my memory - and
    that I seldom or never think of them - which nobody can
    reproach me with, I think. But as to Braat, now that you write
    about him in such a way as to suggest that I do not
    particularly want to take notice of him, I say, far from it -
    will you kindly assure him that I pity him, as I do all those
    who suffer, and that, if he should happen to remember me, I
    send him my kind regards, and that I wish him as much peace and
    serenity as one can possibly have in such a situation? What use
    is such a wish to him? - not much - therefore one wants to keep
    such things to oneself unless one is called upon to say
    something. At the same time I beg of you, in case you should
    have said something about my having written in the way you
    reproach me with, to tell him that you have only imagined the
    abusive term. For most decidedly you will not find it in my
    letter.</p>

    <p>You write that you tried to answer my letters, but
    refrained. In the same way I on my part intended to write you
    another letter, but I refrained too.</p>

    <p>However, I want you to know that if you feel inclined to
    leave the work you are going to buy from me alone, or even tear
    it up, this is no reason for me not to do my best on it.</p>

    <p>For this month I have some pen-and-ink drawings for you, in
    the first place those that are at Rappard's for the moment,
    about which I had a letter from him, telling me that he liked
    them <i>all</i>, and <i>especially</i> admired the sentiment in
    <art id=1129>&ldquo;Behind the Hedges&rdquo;</art> and <art id=1135>&ldquo;The
    Kingfisher,&rdquo;</art> and <art id=1130>the</art> first<art id=1133> three</art>
    <art id=1128>&ldquo;Winter Gardens&rdquo;</art> which he also liked very much.</p>

    <p>Beside those, I have a few painted studies which are <i>your
    property</i>, which I will send you <i>if you like</i>, but if
    you don't care to have them, I will ask you if I may keep them
    for some time, as I need them for my work. The one is <art id=0029>a large
    study of a weaver, weaving a piece of red cloth</art>
    - <art id=0034>the little church in the cornfields</art> - a view
    of a little old village here in the neighbourhood.</p>
