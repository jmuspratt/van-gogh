  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your letter and thank you for it, and for the
    enclosure. When you write that you are again faced with your
    bad half-year - for I think it lasts half a year - that is not
    exactly pleasant news for you to write, nor for me to
    receive.</p>

    <p>But we must try to remedy it, try to make it better for both
    of us.</p>

    <p>Before I received your letter and its enclosure, I had
    already done a thing which I don't think you will approve of,
    but I am sorry to say that I do not care much what you opinion
    of it is. I have once more tried to renew the relations with
    Mauve and, if possible, also with Tersteeg. I do not know if I
    shall succeed, but I must have a freer scope, for having been
    without any intercourse with the world of art for a <i>full
    year and longer</i>, as I have, notwithstanding all good will,
    one comes to a dead end and must renew oneself.</p>

    <p>This is a thing you <i>never</i> feel or understand. You say
    &ldquo;go on painting,&rdquo; but for the rest you know
    nothing. I do not take this <i>in bad part</i>, but on the
    other hand I do not think it intelligent of you, which please
    note.</p>

    <p>It is perfectly true what you say: &ldquo;that it is more
    likely that I shall achieve something by making good pictures
    than by discussing revolutionary questions.&rdquo; I find this
    so true that, while you were writing it, I was just taking
    steps to promote the direct progress of my work by asking to be
    allowed to paint some studies in Mauve's studio again.</p>

    <p>You are always contradicting yourself. In your letter the
    sentence quoted above is immediately followed by the question:
    can I perhaps point out to you some new ideas on the problem of
    reforming the art trade?</p>

    <p>Shall I point one out to you, which is in your personal
    interest as well as in mine? - don't bother about the thing in
    general, back my application to Mauve and Tersteeg.</p>

    <p>Help me to get afloat and to earn money, not only by sending
    your money but also by your influence, and more sympathy, and a
    more unalloyed friendship. I say again, back the step I have
    taken, for instance; it should have been taken long ago, with
    the necessary support from you.</p>

    <p>Do it unreservedly and energetically, not hesitating and
    hedging when it comes to the point.</p>

    <p>I have strength enough to accomplish something, and to earn
    money too. And then - as you say - if I make progress in my
    painting, and gain a good independent position, I shall be
    worth more than I am now.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">Then later on, when I am somewhat better off, I shall be
    glad to try to give you new hints about that problem of
    reforming the art trade, about which I certainly have my own
    ideas, arising from my own experience with what hinders a
    painter's progress and with the kind of things that sometimes
    make a painter's life unbearable.</label></p>

    <p>I don't think this the right moment to write much about it.
    I only say, If <i>you</i> or <i>I</i> need money to make
    progress, and if for financial reasons we can only work at half
    speed at the moment, we must try to get that money and plod on
    till we have it. <i>Not argue</i>, &ldquo;We are confronting a
    half-year that will be financially bad, so make the best of
    it.&rdquo; What one <i>must</i> have, <i>can</i> be found.</p>

    <p>I have written to Mauve and Tersteeg. If you back me, so
    much the better.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Don't misunderstand me, however, I have not written to Mauve
    or Tersteeg in a complaining tone. On the contrary, but I said
    as forcibly as I could, Give me another opportunity to make a
    few studies at Mauve's!</p>

    <p>That's what I asked, nothing more, and that's the only thing
    I need. They must not be involved in financial matters in any
    way. If I can't spare it myself, you must do your very utmost
    to send me an extra 100 francs, for I am not going for long. If
    you absolutely cannot spare it, Father must try to advance the
    money. I will harp on it till Mauve gives in.</p>

    <p>If I fail alone, we must ask Mauve together until he gives
    in. Then, after that, I shall have gained some hints for
    correcting my work here and improving it, and I shall again
    have a pied-&agrave;-terre with a solid, serious painter, and
    then I warrant you, something will happen before long - either
    I shall exhibit or I shall sell.</p>

    <p>If I wrote you &ldquo;Agir,&rdquo; [Act] then this is not a word,
    you see, Theo! But it is only a way to ask: Are we going to
    progress <i>together</i>, or would you rather lag behind?</p>

    <p>I prefer progressing together, but there mustn't be any
    bother.</p>

    <p>If the financial part should be a difficulty, for Father
    <i>as well as</i> for you, I might get the money from
    Rappard.</p>

    <p>And so, courage! But let us progress together and toil on
    perseveringly until we have achieved it.</p>

    <p>If you <i>do not want</i> to join me, then I shall have to
    go on by myself.</p>

    <p>Now do give me an answer to this.</p>

    <p>It is quite possible, of course, that I shall not hear
    anything, either from Mauve or from Tersteeg.</p>

    <p><i>If</i> I hear anything I'll let you know at once. And if
    they take their time answering, it must be repeated, either by
    me alone or by both of us, just as you like.</p>

    <p><i>Rappard is doing very well, and many others too</i>, but
    you can swear by it that they have not been patient and
    long-suffering and nothing else. We <i>must</i> make progress.
    Get used to the idea that we must <i>get a move on</i>.</p>

    <p>Since my first meeting with Mauve, I have not been grinding
    in vain on the elements of drawing, as well as of colour and of
    the technique of painting. I have learned new things, but I
    need Mauve or somebody else who is very clever, not to make me
    think a great deal of myself, but to give me some courage,
    which oozes away if things <i>drag</i> too long. Forward - and
    what the devil do I care if I fail - if I fail, then I'll try
    again.</p>

    <p>It is necessary to carry on vigorously - with renewed energy
    - and then matters will be settled between us to our
    <i>mutual</i> satisfaction.</p>

    <p>It is very true that primarily I have spent this year on my
    work, secondarily on myself, more than I did last year. I am
    not sorry for it however; I have also made progress, just in
    the things which will help to redress matters in painting - I
    only regret that I couldn't spend a few hundred guilders
    <i>more</i>. What I have gained by it is, that I can now easily
    brush a head from the model in one morning, for instance, and
    that at last my colour is becoming more solid, and more
    correct, and my technique is getting more character.</p>

    <p>Now I can very well understand that my saying I needed money
    for it - and need it still - is criticized. But it cannot be
    denied that one needs a working capital for a painter's
    profession just as for the simple trade of a shoemaker, for
    instance. A working capital which, after a couple of years, can
    yield very good interest, at least to begin with say 20%, and
    can be fully amortized later on.</p>

    <p>So that for instance the money I get from you - let's put it
    at 5000 francs - might be looked upon as my working capital if
    necessary. The interest from this - if through our combined
    energy we could raise it to 20% - would be proof of the
    correctness of your judgement as well as mine, and of taking a
    sound view of business matters. As to this result - getting 20%
    interest from 5000 francs - I want your co-operation in order
    to reach it. These are facts and figures, and you must try to
    recover your confidence and energy to realize them.</p>

    <p>I must work hard to attain this result, but in my opinion
    you for your part might do what you said you would do before:
    side with me - not in a neutral way, but in an energetic,
    positive way.</p>

    <p>Out of the fullness of my conviction I tell you once again
    <i>from the business point of view</i> - speaking as a dealer,
    if you like:</p>

    <p>That the system of doing business solely if one is assured
    of success is not the best one, and is in reality no more than
    a commonplace way of looking at things.</p>

    <p>Doing business <i>quand m&ecirc;me, doing</i> something,
    moving for the sake of moving, hating stagnation and sterility,
    this, as I see it, is a more broad-minded and profitable
    way.</p>

    <p>So it is always the same - <i>not</i> beating about the bush
    - <i>not</i> taking things too much to heart - but having a
    certain confidence in certain things - I spoke to you about it
    in the past, and about what your character had become a few
    years later; certainly gaining the ever-stronger conviction
    that carrying on a fight and concentrating oneself on a few
    well-defined points, but all the same risking one's all, is the
    best thing to do. But the cooler characters doubt this - the
    Bourdoncles - I am quite willing to appreciate these fellows
    too, and they decidedly have their good qualities, but in the
    matter of <i>carrying</i> something <i>out</i>, of persevering
    in it and winning through&hellip;if this is required of them,
    they relapse into their doubts and hesitations. And then it is
    only natural that the flow of business slows down and comes to
    a standstill. Well&hellip;</p>

    <p>Look here now - I must paint 50 heads just for experience,
    because right now I am hitting my stride. As soon as possible,
    and one after the other. I have calculated, but <i>without</i>
    a little extra money, it is not possible to work with that
    vigour which, as far as taking pains and exertion go, I would
    willingly spend on it. I had to buy an overcoat because I am
    more particular about my clothes than before, and some other
    things; the bills for colours also take <i>much</i> out of what
    I get, so that in order to carry out my plans in a short time,
    working at full speed (instead of half speed for economy's
    sake, which never can be real economy), I must manage to get an
    extra 100 francs. In order to win Tersteeg and Mauve over, I
    <i>must</i> do something decidedly energetic, having now
    broached the matter. Is it absolutely impossible for you to let
    me have it now? I <i>must</i> strike while the iron is
    <i>hot</i>; but dear brother and friend, <i>stir up the
    fire</i>.</p>

    <p>Adieu.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
