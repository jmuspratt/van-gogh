    <p>[The first part of the letter is missing.]</p>

    <p>&hellip;If you think it necessary for me to explain matters
    more clearly, well, here you are. You say yourself that you
    want me to leave the woman, yes, leave her completely. All
    right, but I can't and I won't. Do you understand, my friend?
    Such a thing would be treacherous - I am thinking of the old
    Scripture word, &ldquo;Hide not thy face from thy
    neighbour,&rdquo; and <i>now</i> I tell you flatly, No, Theo.
    (And in case you want to assume that I intend to do this, that
    or the other thing, you may think exactly what you want; I
    shall <i>do</i> what I want, Deo volente.)</p>

    <p>I know quite well that this is a delicate point, related to
    money matters - not only in the sense you refer to in your
    letter, but primarily in another sense. If I accept money from
    you and do something which you definitely object to, it would
    be wrong. I have always discussed everything candidly with you,
    and shown myself exactly as I was; I have aimed at
    straightforwardness, but I never acted without seeking your
    advice. Well, if this should stop and we should no longer
    associate with each other in private life, something like a
    false position would emerge. And this I reject.</p>

    <p>I have spoken without reserve about Father, I have spoken
    without reserve about you with reference to this summer - why?
    To induce you to adopt my point of view? No, but because I
    should consider myself dishonest if I kept such things locked
    inside my mind. The fact is that I am not perfidious, and if
    there is something I object to in a person, I say so and am not
    afraid of the consequences, however serious.</p>

    <p>I cannot change, I am made this way. I myself want to clear
    up the situation, and then I say, Stop a bit, for I think quite
    differently about this or that, and I cannot keep up the same
    cordial intercourse with you as before. (I am not saying I
    won't have any intercourse at all with Father or yourself - I'm
    not as stubborn as that.)</p>

    <p>But if something is broken, I feel it. And I say, What is
    broken, <i>is</i> broken. If I do, at least I regain my
    serenity; I should lose my serenity if I were not frank enough.
    I am not afraid to face the future as long as I need not be
    involved in things which I feel to be dishonest.</p>

    <p>And if you want still another reason, then listen to this:
    In order to keep the woman from ruin, I should even be willing
    to swallow my pride over this or that principle as far as money
    is concerned, and more than once I did so for her sake and the
    children's; but if the woman were <i>not</i> there, I should be
    prouder than ever. (This is what I told you in The Hague in
    reply to something you said about being good friends with H. G.
    T., when you said, &ldquo;Yes, that's what I thought.&rdquo;)
    And as I see it the situation is this: under the circumstances,
    if I get no support, e.g. from you, I can do practically
    nothing for the woman; for I think myself that it is <i>not</i>
    in <i>my</i> power to assist her, at least not at once. So you
    have me at your mercy, you particularly, along with many
    others, none of whom can agree with me. <i>And yet you will not
    be able to force me to renounce her</i>, whatever your
    financial power. And seeing that I shall make no concessions in
    the matter of the woman - and I will clearly declare it, loud
    enough for even ears that are most hard of hearing - I announce
    in advance that I have resolved to share with her all that is
    my property and I do not wish to accept any money from you,
    except what I may regard as my property without arri&egrave;re
    pens&eacute;e.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>As I myself do not coerce anyone, so I do not want to be
    coerced myself; I who respect the liberty of others insist on
    my own liberty.</p>

    <p>As for the woman and her children, she is attached to me,
    <i>even after the separation</i>, and I to her. And now I
    should in some way agree, tacitly or not tacitly, to abandon
    her? No, this time I shall make no such agreement. I do not ask
    you to be responsible for any expenses whatever; on the
    contrary, I tell you that you may reduce the money or stop
    sending it altogether, but she shall have her share of all I
    have.</p>

    <p>I should be a coward, brother, if I were ambiguous about
    this. And if it should come about that I have nothing myself,
    all right - this would be the very worst that could happen, and
    perhaps there might be others besides you who would be willing
    to make life possible for me. And if not, so be it.</p>

    <p>In short, rest assured that I believe I am <i>entitled</i>
    to do anything which does not hurt anyone else and it is my
    duty to live up to the liberty which not only I myself but
    every human being has an unlimited and natural right to - this
    liberty, I say, being the only <i>station in life</i> one
    should live up to. Before I act, I most decidedly ask myself,
    Shall I hurt anyone by doing this or that? but unless it is
    irrefutably proved to me that I shall hurt someone by doing a
    particular thing, I need not refrain from doing it.</p>
