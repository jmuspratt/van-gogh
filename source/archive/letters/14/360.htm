  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Last night I received your letter with the enclosed 100
    francs. I can tell you that, having had less expenses through
    my temporary stay here, I am now at a point where I can cover
    my last year's deficit.</p>

    <p>I draw your attention to this in order that you may see I
    hate carelessness in business as much as you do, and that I
    make a point of meeting my obligations to other people. And
    that I am in no mood to be careless in business matters, <i>on
    the contrary</i>, I assure you.</p>

    <p>It is my firm intention to try to carry on my work, and you
    must not think I work less hard here every day than I used
    to.</p>

    <p>All's well that ends well, says the proverb. Now, as to the
    misgivings I wrote you I felt about continuing to accept money
    from you. We <i>can</i> wind up now, at a moment when I can get
    off without a deficit; all the more reason for me always to
    call the way you dealt with me financially <i>most
    generous</i>. And I do not at all pretend it was your fault
    that I had a deficit at the end of last year. I only repeat
    that I am very glad no bill is left unpaid now.</p>

    <p>Supplies of colours and other things have all been treated
    honestly and are paid.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">I owe a great debt to you, however, and if I continued in
    exactly the same way, it would grow worse and worse. Now I want
    to make you a proposal for the future. Let me send you my work,
    and keep what you like for yourself, but I insist on
    considering the money I receive from you after March as money I
    have earned. And I quite approve of it being, in the beginning,
    less than I have received up to now. </label>Toward the end of January
    or in the beginning of February I wrote you that, on my coming
    home, I was struck by the fact that the money I was in the
    habit of receiving from you was looked upon in the first place
    as something <i>precarious</i>, and secondly as what I will
    call charity for a poor fool. And I could establish the fact
    that this opinion was even communicated to people who had
    absolutely <i>nothing</i> to do with it - for instance, the
    respectable natives of this region - and I was asked at least
    three times in one week by absolute strangers, &ldquo;Why is it
    that you never sell your work?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Just how pleasant one's daily life can be under such
    circumstances, I leave to you to decide.</p>

    <p>For my part, I say most decidedly that whatever you may
    think of what I have received from you up to now, I for my part
    consider it as a thing which I shall pay back if possible.</p>

    <p>If I have some luck with my work, I shall most certainly pay
    it back. For the present, there can be no question of it, so we
    will not mention it.</p>

    <p>Toward March I shall send you some watercolours from here.
    If you do not want them, I will take them to somebody else,
    <i>but I prefer to deal with you</i>.</p>

    <p>Those watercolours will have their faults, yet I do not
    think it foolish of me to start showing my work, to bring it
    before the public's eye.</p>

    <p>At a certain moment Rappard did the same, and carried it
    through from the very beginning.</p>

    <p>I, for my part, do it rather reluctantly, but I must do
    it.</p>

    <p>So from March on I shall begin to send my work here and
    there regularly. And first to you, but do not think yourself
    obliged to take anything which you do not really care for.</p>

    <p>I should think that in consequence of this, however much our
    feelings might differ or come to differ, we should not be
    obliged to speak about such things, and still less quarrel over
    them, which in my opinion one is <i>obliged</i> to do if one
    has a relation with someone like the one we have had up to
    now.</p>

    <p>I repeat, I should object to continuing <i>on the same
    footing</i>. But I should continue our relation in a somewhat
    modified way with the greatest pleasure.</p>

    <p>I do not say that I want you to look upon the things you
    might accept from me as something you must try to sell at
    <i>once</i>.</p>

    <p>If for the time being you should take my work, not in the
    first place in your capacity as a dealer, but more especially
    in the quality of one who has it in his heart to do something
    for fellows like me, who are only just starting - that is
    enough for me.</p>

    <p>But after March I will accept no money from you - or at
    least absolutely as little as possible - for which I do not
    give some work in return.</p>

    <p>I should not be able to continue <i>on the same footing</i>
    with animation, but I shall start on the new thing with
    animation as soon as the old thing is cut off - at least this
    is my opinion. If you do not want to entertain the other
    proposal, then leave it alone.</p>

    <p>I want to feel free with you, but at the same time with
    <i>equal</i> sincerity I want you <i>to feel free with me</i>.
    If there should be something in my work that pleases you, I
    shall feel very happy; and if it should not please you and you
    should not want to have anything to do with it, then I should
    not be able to say anything about it.</p>

    <p>Moreover, whatever the difference in feelings may be, and
    the difference over this or that, we are brothers, and I
    certainly hope that we shall go on behaving like brothers.</p>

    <p>I also hope that you and Father will not thwart me if I take
    no other studio for the present than the little mangle room
    here.</p>

    <p>I shall take another, and not live with Father any longer,
    as soon as my work brings in enough money to pay for my taking
    a house again.</p>

    <p>Since I have been here, not a day has passed, I think, when
    I have not been working from morning till night on the weavers
    or the peasants; I shall be very glad if you approve of my
    proposal. Then extremes will be avoided and we shall keep a
    straight course. If you know of a better plan, I shall be glad
    to hear it. Goodbye, and thanks for what you sent. With a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
