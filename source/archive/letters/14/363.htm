  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am rather surprised that I haven't heard from you, seeing
    as you wrote, &ldquo;if it inconveniences you to wait, write me
    by return mail.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, I wrote to tell you that it certainly did
    inconvenience me to wait longer - but I got no direct answer to
    that. The purport of my letter was exactly that, as I thought
    too much half-heartedness was creeping into our friendship, it
    was not stimulating, etc., which I need not repeat. It is
    certainly a bad economy, time is money too, and as I even have
    to wait for my colours, it is perfectly <i>absurd</i> in my
    opinion. But you know all that - after all my business is not
    your business - and if you do not understand it of your own
    accord, why should I lose patience and time harping on it?</p>

    <p>As long as there is any spirit left in me, you can hardly
    expect me to agree to this slackening more and more.</p>

    <p>You should carefully train yourself in that system of
    prudence and respectability and all the rest of it, for then
    you will make great progress - precisely in the direction of
    mediocrity, I mean to say. <i>The one</i> leads to <i>the
    other</i> - <i>straight</i>. Not because I say so - but because
    one has only to open one's eyes and take the trouble to look
    about one to see it happen a thousand times.</p>

    <p>But I hear that your friend Braat has fallen ill - (in fact
    I always found him so during the short time I knew him) -
    perhaps that was the reason you forgot it - well.</p>

    <p>However it may be, be so kind as to answer my last letter,
    and to let me know whether or not you will change it in that
    way.</p>

    <p>Mother is gradually improving.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>In the normal case of being on good terms with each other
    there could never be any question of stipulating that we should
    not meddle with each other's private affairs, and if you felt
    the least bit of warmth for my work you would not neglect it
    absolutely. And I write you as I do more particularly to make
    you feel how cold you have become toward what we undertook
    together full of courage, and moreover that too much coldly
    respectable diplomacy is creeping into your life - I say this
    much more emphatically than I would if I attached much value to
    an agreement being more or less fixed.</p>

    <p>The real cause of the question is understanding or
    misunderstanding each other - a question of coolness or warmth
    of feeling between us.</p>

    <p>And I find what Zola says about &ldquo;dragging on a
    connection&rdquo; as true as you do - it deadens all energy.
    But the question remains, What is the cause of this dragging
    on?</p>

    <p>I, for my part, who like to live in the country rather than
    the city, certainly do not want to break with you; but as it is
    now, when I see that notwithstanding my working all day long I
    do not get any further with you, I cannot stand it, as I see in
    it a neglect of my own affairs, for which, after all, <i>I</i>
    should be responsible later on. Will you see to it that my work
    is brought under the eyes of those people who, if not now then
    later on, must become its buyers? - all right - then! I need
    not bother about it, and only have to occupy myself with my
    painting.</p>

    <p>But leaving it alone <i>the way you do</i> is <i>negligence</i>. If
    you want to think this conceited of me - well, that's your own
    business - but for myself I think <i>you</i> conceited where
    there is no occasion for it. Because of the very fact that
    again this month you haven't the money for the usual
    remittance, you may as well reflect whether playing the big bug
    will get us anywhere.</p>

    <p>If I did not feel more strongly every day that I must earn
    some money, I should keep my studies quietly for myself, as
    Rappard does. But, as you say, we are not in Rappard's position
    - but for all that I am getting more and more cramped. Today I
    brought home my ninth painted study of a weaver; painting costs
    money, and when I have to wait for the colours - as it now
    happens over and over again - I lose time. And look here - if
    you had a little more interest in it, we should have what we
    need. And what kind of impression will it make on others if
    <i>you</i> act <i>like this</i>? Truly, this is not conducive
    to inspiring confidence.</p>
