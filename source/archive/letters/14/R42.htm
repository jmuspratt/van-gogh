    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Herewith a few more poems by Jules Breton; if you don't have
    them, I feel sure you will be greatly impressed by them. Today,
    or rather during the past few days, I painted a study of the
    weaving loom of which you have the sketch. <sup>1</sup> I am
    also trying to find the colour of the winter garden. But it is
    already a spring garden by now; it has changed into something
    quite different.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>You are now in for a little scolding - that is to say - when
    I was with you last winter you were opposed to
    &ldquo;enthusiasm&rdquo; - I mean, you said that Jaap [Jacob]
    Maris said that enthusiasm was I don't know what. But he, that
    is, Jaap, didn't exactly put this into practice in his own life
    - even though he may have said something like that, applying it
    to some special case - since he himself continued to paint
    under <i>all</i> circumstances. If it were so, then birds would
    stop singing and painters would stop painting if they were
    forever asking themselves whether or not they were too
    ardent.</p>

    <p>And now read &ldquo;Les Cigales&rdquo; [The Crickets] - and
    - I am not going to add another word.</p>

    <p>1. See letter 363 to Theo.</p>
