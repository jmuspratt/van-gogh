  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am sure you will be interested to hear particulars about
    the call to Helvoirt that Father has received. Father told the
    people at Helvoirt that he would <i>not even</i> consider it
    unless the salary at Helvoirt were brought on a level with the
    salary at Nuenen. And Father wrote today that they do not seem
    to object to making up the difference in salary - I think they
    will have to add 150 guilders. So - although nothing has been
    settled yet - considering the willingness of the worthy
    natives, there is definitely a chance that as the result of his
    own words, Father will have to consider it seriously. This is
    important to me, as I should <i>certainly not</i> like to go
    with them to Helvoirt. So I wanted to state precisely how
    matters stand.</p>

    <p>Though it has been freezing pretty hard here for the last
    few days, I am still at work out-of-doors, on <art id=0125>a rather large
    study (more than 40 inches) of an old water mill at Gennep, on
    the other side of Eindhoven</art>.</p>

    <p>I want to do it entirely out-of-doors, but it will certainly
    be the last I shall paint out-of-doors this year.</p>

    <p>Since I wrote you, I have also been working on other
    studies, including two heads of poldermen.</p>

    <p>I now have three people in Eindhoven who want to learn to
    paint, and whom I am teaching to paint still-lifes.</p>

    <p>I can safely say that since your visit I have made progress
    in the technique of painting and in colour. And that I shall
    continue to do so, &ldquo;il y a les premiers pas qui
    co&ucirc;tent&rdquo; in painting; it is easier later, and I
    have a number of trumps in my hand. And I think tricks can be
    made with them.</p>

    <p>You know that I took steps to make it up with Mauve and
    Tersteeg after what happened in the past.</p>

    <p>I am not sorry I did so.</p>

    <p>But they have refused to have anything to do with me, very
    &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; refused. This does not discourage
    me.</p>

    <p>I consider it like sending a picture to an exhibition and
    having it refused.</p>

    <p>At first one must meet with opposition a few times.</p>

    <p>So I repeat, I am not sorry for the advances I made, and
    shall probably repeat them, not at once, but before long.</p>

    <p>Now I must tell you that I should be very glad if you did
    not stay entirely neutral in this, but, on the contrary, if you
    helped me get what I want. I have owned myself to be in the
    wrong, not only to Mauve, but also to Tersteeg. I did it the
    more readily because I believe that later they will see for
    themselves that, on their part, they have absolutely
    misunderstood some things. Which they don't see yet.</p>

    <p>So on my part this time I went so far as to acknowledge
    unreservedly and unmistakably that I had been in the wrong as
    to the past, and <i>for the rest</i> I proposed to show them my
    <i>work</i> as it gets better - which means that at any rate I
    am absolved from having to make further apologies in the
    future. <i>Once is enough</i>, and really it was not
    <i>necessary</i> for me to go as far as that - namely
    <i>unconditionally</i>. Getting them to be <i>open-minded</i>
    on <i>their</i> part is another question - come to my aid in
    this matter <i>if you feel inclined to do so</i>. If not -
    don't worry - but then I shall return to the attack after a
    while.</p>

    <p>I do not know how you have taken my last letter, which was
    not meant unkindly. My affairs can <i>prosper</i>, and in both
    our interests, I wish we could concentrate all the power a our
    disposal.</p>

    <p>I sent both Tersteeg and Mauve a few words in answer to
    their refusal, to tell them that &ldquo;<i>I perhaps agreed
    with Tersteeg, it was better for me to look for new friends
    than to try to renew old relations, that this was exactly my
    own idea too, but that except and besides that, I had enough
    confidence in the future not even to give up the renewal of old
    relations, perhaps even better than before</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>This was my answer to Tersteeg, and it is also my answer to
    you. I believe it possible to be on <i>better</i> terms with
    you too than we are at present.</p>

    <p>But speaking frankly - I think you have been too neutral
    toward me this past one and a half or two years, and above all
    things I desire more <i>cordiality</i>, our friendship having
    been too cool and too inactive for my taste. You may find this
    conceited if you like, but it isn't; I pointed this out to you
    before, and again now, for serious, practical reasons.</p>

    <p>[Written separately] Margot Begemann will be returning to
    Nuenen one of these days; I have always remained good friends
    with her, and it is on my advice that she has not given way to
    the pressure exerted by her sisters, who showed clearly that
    they preferred for her to stay away, and who are still annoying
    her by suggesting that she has made a mess of things. On the
    contrary, her family is under an obligation to her, for at the
    time her brother went bankrupt, she put her own money into the
    business.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.love">The simple fact is that if she and I choose to love each
    other, if we are attached to each other, which we have been for
    a long time for that matter, we are doing no <i>harm</i> which
    people have a right to reproach either one of us with. And in
    my eyes it is absurd that people should feel obliged to bother
    their heads about it - with the idea that it is in my interest
    or hers.</label></p>

    <p>This meant doing a bad turn.</p>

    <p>It may be that they all did this with the best of
    intentions, but&hellip;There was Louis Begemann; he too had
    objections, but he behaved and went on behaving in such a way
    that she as well as I could talk things over with him, and its
    not turning out <i>worse</i> was due to his being humane and
    calm, so that he could <i>help</i> when the thing I knew about
    happened, whereas the others <i>only hindered</i>. And we were
    quite of one mind as to the measures that had to be taken
    then.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, I had already warned him three days
    before, and told him: I am uneasy about your sister.</p>

    <p>It cannot be denied that at various times she did good turns
    for almost <i>all</i> the people in the surroundings, either in
    case of sickness or when they were in some trouble or other.
    And it is a fact that she and I became attached to each other
    during Mother's illness. Only the other day she wrote me: If
    there should be sick people at Nuenen, do go and look them up,
    and see if they can be given help. In short - there are a
    thousand things like that in her character. And the <i>very
    mildest</i> thing one can say of it is that in this case a most
    deplorable misunderstanding has arisen.</p>

    <p>As for you, on looking back I feel sure <i>that now you
    would not speak the way you did that evening any
    more</i>.</p>

    <p>But that concerned only <i>me</i>, and I could stand it, so
    on my part there is no question of reproaching you in this
    matter.</p>

    <p>However, only by way of <i>explanation</i> to you alone, I
    tell you that <i>her sisters</i> spoke to <i>her in the same
    way you spoke to me, who can stand it</i>; in her case it made
    her desperate. <i>You were not the least bit at fault in
    this</i>, for you spoke to <i>me</i>, and I do not take such
    things lying down, and you did <i>not</i> speak to <i>her</i>.
    But the <i>real fault</i> lies with her sisters, or rather
    <i>one of the sisters</i> in particular, who appears to be more
    hard-hearted, as in fact she is still <i>sulking</i> and
    bearing a grudge.</p>

    <p>You&hellip;you would have <i>to tell me yourself</i> that
    you are bearing a grudge - before I should suspect you of
    it.</p>

    <p>No more than I bear a grudge against you.</p>
