  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Enclosed I am sending you two photographs, later on you will
    get two more of weavers.</p>

    <p>I intended to have twelve photographs taken - a series of
    Brabant scenes, including the six I am making for Hermans.</p>

    <p>I intended to send them to some illustrated papers, to try
    to get some work, or at least to become known.</p>

    <p>But I have given up the idea, as the photographer only
    produces copies that do not render the real chiaroscuro, or
    hardly do; besides, he retouches much and badly, and yet very
    often leaves dark what is light in the picture, and vice
    versa.</p>

    <p>However, I will have another photo taken of the weavers in
    carte-de-visite size only, because being so far away from the
    illustrated papers here, I must find a means to get connections
    in another way than by words.</p>

    <p>This winter I hope to make several drawings, particularly of
    the same compositions, and to send them, for instance, to the
    London News<i>,</i> which you may have noticed is now often
    better than the Graphic, and among other things, has just
    reproduced a very beautiful Frank Holl, and a beautiful
    landscape with sheep.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">Recently I have been working very hard; I believe, what with
    other emotions, I have even overworked myself. For I am in a
    melancholy mood, and all these things have combined to upset me
    in such a way that there are many days when I am almost
    paralyzed.</label></p>

    <p><label content="psychology.insomnia">I cannot eat, and I cannot sleep - that is to say, not
    enough, and that makes one weak.</label></p>

    <p>But I shall get over it again, especially as I have fairly
    good news from Utrecht.</p>

    <p>But I am still very anxious because I am afraid it will be a
    long time before she has entirely recovered.</p>

    <p>Perhaps it will be a long time before I get over it too. I
    always regret, Theo, that I am standing on one side of a
    certain barricade, you on the other, which barricade is not
    actually visible any more as a <i>structure of paving
    stones</i>, but which certainly does exist socially, and will
    continue to do so.</p>

    <p>In that lithograph by Daumier or Lemud, whichever it may be,
    the principal subject is a person whose story I remember.</p>

    <p>There were two brothers, and they were standing on <i>the
    same side</i>, and both were killed one after the other, <i>for
    the same cause</i>.</p>

    <p>That might have occurred in our case, but now I am almost
    sure it will never happen. I, for my part, know well enough
    that the future will always remain very difficult for me, and I
    am almost sure that in the future I shall never be what people
    call <i>prosperous</i>.</p>

    <p>I think that Father also feels it is fatality rather than
    downright intention when there is sometimes such a decided
    difference of opinion between us. But I wish that I didn't
    <i>hit</i> other people, that Father had not been standing
    <i>right</i> in front of me at times. Well, sometimes I think
    that at all events painting can prevent worse things, and that
    otherwise it would be even worse. For the future, I have no
    other plans now than to continue my Brabant subjects till I am
    far enough along to sell them in Belgium, for instance, or
    elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Then, when I have some firm footing, I should like to go
    back to the miners once again.</p>

    <p>I ask you, not to sympathize with my work, but whenever you
    know of some resources, tell me so. Rappard has been both in
    Drenthe and in Terschelling again, and seems to have got a good
    crop of studies. Probably he will come here again in October
    for some time. Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>The picture of the sower is as large as that of the woman
    spinning; the colour of the soil is neutral but just a little
    pink, light green farther on. The blouse of the man is blue,
    and his trousers, brown. The gaiters are dirty linen, I think
    in the picture the head stands out better against the sky than
    in the photograph.</p>

    <p>Just listen, Theo, as to that barricade, you know there was
    a time in my life when I also stood with the Guizots, etc.</p>

    <p>But as soon as I had enough of it, you know how I turned
    away with energy and persistence.</p>

    <p>The younger people <i>now do not want me</i>, however ; all
    right, <i>I don't care</i>; as men, and as painters, I like the
    generation of about '48 better than those of '84; but from
    those of '48, <i>not</i> the Guizots, but the revolutionaries,
    Michelet - and also <i>the peasant painters</i> of
    Barbizon.</p>

    <p>You must decide for yourself what you are going to do about
    it, but I myself cannot swallow everything. Your apparent
    indication in your letter that Goupil &amp; Co. are specialists
    in Millet and Daumier is really too outrageous. Do you really
    think I am such a dullard as to believe such enormities? In
    most cases G. &amp; Co. lagged behind with the original
    artists; well, I know just as well as you what kind of fellows
    their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s have been. One of Goupil's best
    strokes of business is that in recent years they have pushed
    various Dutchmen such as Maris, Mauve, and that was
    particularly on N. G.'s initiative. Their having Breton is to
    all intents and purposes a separate question. But at the time
    when Millet, Dupr&eacute;, Corot, Daubigny were <i>young</i>,
    tell me - did Messrs. Goupil &amp; Co. concern themselves very
    much with them??</p>

    <p>Breton, this you know, is personally rather different from
    Millet and Corot and I can well understand that Goupil &amp;
    Co. consider him &ldquo;less disagreeable as a man.&rdquo;
    Daumier - especially the way Daumier was in his earlier days -
    when I recall this and set against it the Guizotlike character
    of father Goupil as <i>he</i> was then ... believe me, it
    amuses me to think of this contrast.</p>

    <p>Goupil &amp; Co. has always been a bit orthodox, and has
    been rather in the habit of looking down on other houses, as if
    they were something better than the other dealers - well, it
    was and is tweedledum and tweedledee.</p>

    <p>I believe that Millet and Daumier were ignored by
    practically <i>all</i> art dealers. Once an <i>art lover</i>
    said of the way the dealers acted with Corot's studies the
    excellent always escapes them, <i>l'excellent leur
    &eacute;chappe toujours</i>. And this remark is shrewd.
    Usually their opinions are commonplace generalities - like
    those of Joseph Prudhomme in Monnier's book.</p>

    <p>But speculating on this is tedious, for you as well as for
    me.</p>

    <p>Goodbye.</p>

    <p>I have just read Mother's note. I am glad you can see from
    it that I speak less and less to them about what is going on
    between us. I tell them that everything is all right, and I
    shall go on telling them so until I say just as succinctly that
    we have concluded that our affairs were diverging too much.
    This is true. You belong to Goupil &amp; Co. And Goupil &amp;
    Co. will certainly not do anything with my work for years to
    come. In the meantime, I ask you, is it possible for me to
    reconcile myself to making absolutely no progress, which is
    what you lead me to expect?</p>

    <p>There is something I want to ask you: Why doesn't Cor go to
    Goupil's just as you and I started life there when we were his
    age? I hear of a plan to leave him at the Secondary School for
    a year or two longer - I hear of a luminous idea, suggested in
    sober earnest by Father, of making a consul of him. And this
    although nobody in this house, nor any of those with whom
    preliminary correspondence has been carried on about this
    matter, has the faintest idea what a consul actually does.</p>

    <p>I am not in the least interested in this business, but I
    think that this consulate is somewhat similar to the conception
    of the old lady here in the village, who thinks the mounted
    constabulary such fine fellows to look at. But I am quite
    surprised I never hear Goupil's mentioned with reference to
    Cor. Why is this? Especially as you stick to them, methinks it
    would be the obvious thing for Cor to enter the firm too. Later
    on you will be company and a help to each other - and at any
    rate he would be in a better position, learn more, see more,
    than as a &ldquo;consul&rdquo; or in a &ldquo;notary's
    office,&rdquo; and so on, or in the &ldquo;Post Office,&rdquo;
    all highly genteel occupations, and much of a muchness. As for
    Cor himself, as far as I know he has no distinct idea whether
    he would like to take up this job or that, seeing that probably
    he has not looked at anything at close quarters, except books,
    the country road, etc. At present I think him a nice boy, but
    it is certainly time for him to do something practical, as I
    see it, for otherwise such fellows are apt to go to seed,
    particularly if they get into too dull an office - go to seed,
    I mean, with respect to self-sufficiency and becoming a
    nonentity.</p>
