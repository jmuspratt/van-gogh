  <body>
    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half September 1884</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Just a word to tell you that I have been to Utrecht to visit
    her.</p>

    <p>I also had an interview with the physician with whom she is
    staying, because I wanted to get his advice as to what I must
    or must not do, for the sake of the patient's health and
    future, i.e. either continue our relation or break it off.</p>

    <p>In this matter I want no other advice except that of a
    physician. And I have heard that her health is greatly shaken -
    though she is recovering - that in fact, according to the
    doctor, who has known her from childhood, and who was also her
    mother's physician - she had <i>always</i> had a very frail
    constitution and will always have; that for the moment there
    are <i>two</i> dangerous things, that she is too weak to marry,
    at least for the moment, but that at the same time a separation
    would be dangerous too.</p>

    <p>So some time will have to pass, and then I shall receive a
    definite hint of what will be best for her, separation or
    not.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.love">Of course I shall always remain her friend, <i>mutually</i>
    we are perhaps <i>too much</i> attached to each other.</label></p>

    <p>I spent almost the whole day with her then.</p>

    <p>I went to see Rappard for a moment, but he wasn't in
    town.</p>

    <p>Last week I made the sketch for the last of the six pictures
    for Hermans.</p>

    <p>Wood-gatherers in the snow, so he has all six of them to
    copy; when he has finished this one and they are thoroughly
    dry, I shall work them up into pictures. I wish you could see
    all six of them together in the panels for which they are
    destined. His copies are very correct as to the drawing, but I
    think his colour is bad; and as for mine, the warm grey, often
    bituminous, tone in which I kept the whole thing harmonizes
    with the woodwork and the style of the room. Goodbye.</p>

    <p>You should not have the impression that what you write,
    &ldquo;that it is evident she is like an angel of
    patience,&rdquo; is correct.</p>

    <p>This is decidedly not the case; it is the very thing I asked
    the doctor about - &ldquo;She has always had a highly irritable
    temper,&rdquo; he said.</p>

    <p>I do not think it impossible or improbable that you - sooner
    or later when you put your theory on marriage into practice
    <i>yourself</i> - that is to say, after you have gained a nice
    secure position for yourself and ask a girl in marriage - you
    will think of me once in a while.</p>

    <p>It is true that I myself have twice met with great sorrow,
    sorrow of a totally divergent nature. So be it - but you will
    live to see that your own theory on this subject is not always
    sure to yield the results that one would be inclined to expect.
    When you have gained a secure position, then you will find a
    wife and children and domestic happiness. This is a beautiful
    promise society makes, but does society keep this promise?</p>

    <p>Generally speaking, society disappoints <i>everybody</i> in
    <i>all</i> kinds of behaviour.</p>

    <p>I say this quite good-naturedly and not by way of reproach -
    <i>not at all!</i></p>

    <p>Il y a du bon en tout mouvement &eacute;nergetique, I often
    think.</p>

    <p>Theo, now that I know more than at first what made her so
    desperate - do you want to know what it was? That night <i>her
    family</i> spoke to <i>her</i> approximately in the same tone -
    as <i>you</i> did to <i>me</i>. Well, <i>then</i> I decidedly
    <i>lost my temper</i> with you - this is over now - and she
    would have taken it in extremely bad part if she had <i>my</i>
    temperament. Well, the things that were said - naturally
    <i>not</i> the things <i>you</i> said, but what <i>her</i>
    <i>sisters</i> said - made her so <i>desperate</i> and so
    excessively melancholy that she did what I wrote you about.</p>

    <p>Looking at it from <i>your</i> point of view, I , who am
    more of a philosopher, can say - at least on reflection,
    <i>He</i> now thinks <i>that way</i>, let him.</p>

    <p>But she, <i>when they expostulated with her, believed she
    had done something frightful. And this without having done
    anything she ought not to have done</i>. She took it so much to
    heart that she felt deserted by everyone and everything.</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin] She is still greatly incensed by her
    sister's conduct, though it is subsiding - and, for that
    matter, the sisters have withdrawn a good deal of what they
    said. One of them, however, goes on being sulky, and this one
    also tried to speak to me, but I gave her as good as I got.</p>

    <p>All yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>[Enclosed herewith] I think it deeply pathetic that this
    woman (while she was so <i>weak</i> and defeated by five or six
    other women that <i>she took poison</i>) says kind of
    triumphantly, as if she had gained a victory and as if she had
    found <i>rest</i>, &ldquo;I too have loved at last.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She had never really loved before.</p>

    <p>As for me, these days are sometimes full of an anguish which
    makes me <i>sick</i>, which can neither be diverted nor
    stilled, as with much forethought <i>I have always respected
    her</i> on a certain point that would have dishonoured her
    socially (though if I had wanted it, I had her in my power), so
    that socially she can maintain her position perfectly, and
    <i>if</i> she <i>understood it well</i>, she would have a
    splendid opportunity to take her revenge and get satisfaction
    from those very women who defeated her. And I will lend her a
    helping hand in this, but she does not always understand, or
    else she understands <i>too late</i>. Well.</p>

    <p>It is a pity that I didn't meet her <i>before</i>, for
    instance, ten years ago. Now she gives me the impression of a
    Cremona violin which has been spoiled by bad, bungling
    repairers.</p>

    <p>And the condition she was in when I met her proved to be
    rather too damaged.</p>

    <p>But originally, it was a rare specimen of great value, and
    <i>even now</i> she has, in spite of drawbacks, great
    value.</p>

    <p>The only thing I ever saw again of Kee was a picture taken a
    year later; was she changed for the worse? On the contrary,
    <i>more interesting</i>.</p>

    <p><i>That disturbing the tranquillity of a woman</i>, as
    theological people call it (sometimes theologians <i>sans le
    savoir</i>), is sometimes <i>the breaking of stagnation or
    melancholy</i>, which steals over many people and is <i>worse
    than death itself</i><i>.</i> Some people think it terrible to
    hurl them back into life, into love, and one must consider very
    carefully how far one may go. But if one does it with motives
    other than egoism, well, then the women themselves will
    sometimes get <i>angry</i>, and may even hate instead of love,
    que soit.</p>

    <p>But they will not easily despise the man who did it, while
    they do despise the men who have extinguished the manliness in
    themselves. Well, those are the deep things of life. But as for
    anyone who does not think about them or laughs at them, Mouret
    justly calls him a &ldquo;dupe,&rdquo; and in his anger, even
    &ldquo;b&ecirc;te.&rdquo;</p>
