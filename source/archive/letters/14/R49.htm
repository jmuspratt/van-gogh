    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half September 1884</p>

    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Just a few words in haste. My parents asked me whether I
    have had any further news about your visit. I told them that I
    supposed you would come in <i>October</i> in all probability,
    but that I did not know an exact date. <sup>1</sup> Let me tell
    you quite privately that, <i>though you will always be
    welcome</i>, <i>and</i> are <i>expected</i> at <i>any
    time</i>, it would be more convenient for those at home
    if you came in <i>October</i> instead of in
    <i>November</i>, for instance, because of the fact that
    I believe they are expecting other guests <i>later on</i>, for
    which reason I myself may go and stay somewhere else in
    <i>November</i>.</p>

    <p>You will see from what I say that not only I but my parents
    especially are counting on your coming, and that it would
    greatly disappoint us if your visit did not come off - so much
    so that I should regret having written you this if it
    shortened your visit by a single hour.</p>

    <p>That my parents spoke about it was meant rather as a hint to
    <i>me</i> that certain people were expected to come in
    November, people who like my room better than my company; so I
    repeat, a hint to <i>me</i> that they would not be sorry if I
    were not at home, say, in November or perhaps the first half of
    December.</p>

    <p>But most positively <i>they</i> as well as <i>I</i> are
    expecting <i>you</i> and we should all be disappointed if you
    did not come.</p>

    <p>But as I have already told them that I intend to go on a
    trip in November, so as not to be in anybody's way, my parents
    are counting on <i>that</i> too.</p>

    <p>So do come in <i>October</i> and stay as <i>long as
    possible</i> - just as you wrote in your last letter, for that
    matter. But I shall have to be away during
    <i>November</i>. It is <i>very beautiful</i> here. Only
    don't postpone your visit too long.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>It is really damned inconvenient for me not to be here in
    November, and I suppose I shall stay in the neighborhood,
    somewhere in Brabant, after all. But as I <i>think</i> they are
    expecting guests, who are in the habit of coming in the
    beginning of the winter until, say, Christmas, I myself
    immediately told them of my intended trip, <i>which in reality
    I had not planned at all</i>, and should not have thought of
    without a special reason.</p>

    <p>Something else - if you come, let me know what train you're
    taking and please come by way of Eindhoven, so that I can meet
    you at the station there. Then we'll go together to that fellow
    I'm making those decorations for - the six canvases I wrote you
    about. That art lover is now copying them, and all six of them
    are at his house. He is a very pleasant fellow, by profession a
    goldsmith and a chaser of brass and other metals for church
    decorations, etc. if you leave Utrecht early in the morning, I
    think you will be in Eindhoven a little before or after twelve
    o'clock. That would be exactly the best time for us to go there
    together, and we can either take the train or walk to Nuenen
    toward evening.</p>
