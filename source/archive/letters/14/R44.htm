  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Your letter about the drawings delighted me. <sup>1</sup> As
    for the weaving loom, the study of that apparatus was indeed
    made on the spot from start to finish, and it was a hard job -
    on account of the fact that one must sit so close to it that it
    is difficult to take measurements; I did include the figure in
    the drawing after all. But what I wanted to express by it was
    just this: &ldquo;When that monstrous black thing of grimed oak
    with all those sticks is seen in such sharp contrast to the
    greyish atmosphere in which it stands, then <i>there</i> in the
    centre of it sits a black ape or goblin or spook that clatters
    with those sticks from early morning till late at night.&rdquo;
    And I indicated that spot by putting in some sort of apparition
    of a weaver, by means of a few scratches and blots, where I had
    seen it sitting. Consequently I hardly gave a thought to the
    proportions of the arms and legs.</p>

    <p>When I had finished drawing the apparatus pretty carefully,
    I thought it was so disgusting that I couldn't hear it rattle
    that I let the spook appear in it. Very well - and - let us say
    it is only a mechanical drawing - all right, but just put it
    beside the technical design for a loom - and <i>mine will be
    more spectral all the same, you may be sure of that</i>. As a
    matter of fact it is no mechanical drawing - or it may be
    except for a &ldquo;je ne sais quoi.&rdquo; And - if you were
    to put my study beside the drawing of a mechanic who had
    designed a weaving loom - mine would express more strongly that
    the thing is made of oak grimed by sweaty hands; and looking at
    it (<i>even if I had not included him in the drawing at
    all</i>, or even if I did add his figure out of proportion),
    you could not help thinking occasionally of the
    <i>workman</i><i>,</i> whereas absolutely nothing like it would
    occur to your mind when you looked at the model of a loom drawn
    by a mechanic. A sort of sigh or lament must issue from that
    contraption of sticks now and then.</p>

    <p>I very much enjoy seeing your drawings of machines. Why? -
    because when you draw <i>nothing but</i> the flywheel, I for
    one <i>cannot help</i> thinking of the boy who turns it, and I
    feel his presence in a way I can't define. And those who look
    upon <i>your</i> mechanical drawings as <i>designs for
    apparatuses</i> do not understand your art at
    <i>all</i><i>.</i></p>

    <p>But - if one draws such an apparatus - taken by itself -
    then I agree with you that one ought to do it in as
    mechanic-like a way as possible, if one wants to profit by it
    as a study.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile I quite understand your idea that, if it were to
    be a <i>black-and-white</i> drawing - which I <i>hope</i> to
    make it someday, if I can get hold of the right model - that
    little black spook in the background must be the centre, the
    starting point, the <i>heart</i> of it, most deeply felt, most
    elaborately finished, and all the rest must be kept subordinate
    to it.</p>

    <p>Well, I was pleased to hear that you liked my winter garden
    a little [F 1130, JH 465]. Indeed, this garden sets me
    dreaming, and since then I have made another one of the same
    subject, also with a little black spook in it, which this time
    too appears in it not as an example, worthy of imitation, of
    the correct drawing of the structure of the human body, but as
    a contrast [F 1128, JH 466]. I am sending you a few others too
    - a sepia sketch of &ldquo;Het Broek&rdquo; - pen-and-ink
    drawings, &ldquo;Pollard Willows&rdquo; [F 1240, JH 469] -
    &ldquo;Poplar Avenue&rdquo; [F 1239, JH 464] - &ldquo;Behind
    the Hedges&rdquo; [F 1129, JH 461] - the
    &ldquo;Kingfisher&rdquo; [F 1135, JH 468] - &ldquo;Winter
    Garden.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I sent them rolled up, but please put them into the
    portfolio along with the others, especially when you return
    them, in order to keep them as flat as possible. I added a
    piece of grey paper; they will show up better if you place them
    against that.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">As for these drawings and art shows, I am not interested in
    art shows. But what I am interested in is this. I work every
    day, of course - and not a week passes without my doing some
    studies like these. I always consider it possible that some day
    I shall find an art lover who would like to buy them from me -
    not one or two but fifty for instance.</label></p>

    <p>I have heard of more than one painter who was forced to part
    in this way with his studies (which he most probably would have
    kept himself if <i>he had been able to</i>), but who on the
    other hand got some money to tide him over the bad times.</p>

    <p>And if I ask you to show them to people as the opportunity
    arises, I repeat, I do this because it is <i>not altogether
    impossible</i> that you will be able to bring me into contact
    with such an art lover. If it does not happen, well, then it
    doesn't; but, inasmuch as my life is getting more difficult
    instead of easier, it is my bounden duty to look for
    opportunities to hunt up chances to sell my work. And I
    therefore ask you to show them when there is a favorable
    opportunity; if they take no notice of them, all right - I am
    prepared for that too. To give a one-man show of my work is
    something I do <i>not</i> desire at all for the time being.</p>

    <p>As for the people who are interested in drawings - among the
    ordinary art-loving public there is always a <i>chance</i> of
    finding some <i>feeling</i> - a little faith and belief; but
    among the superficially initiated like the art dealers (without
    exception) one <i>certainly</i> does not find <i>any</i>
    feeling, belief or faith, but only old files of superficial
    judgments, generalizations, <i>conventional</i> criticism ...
    old files, which I think it would mean losing one's time on -
    and losing one's teeth - to <i>blunt</i> one's dental
    equipment.</p>

    <p>So - show them, if you find an opportunity, but please do
    not do so <i>especially</i> - do not force things - but I
    repeat, I for my part have to do it. If I were not
    <i>forced</i> to do it, should very much prefer to keep at
    least the studies myself, and I <i>would never</i> sell them.
    But... you know the rest.</p>

    <p>Well, goodbye - I have taken up painting again recently.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>At times I think of never doing anything but pen-and-ink
    drawings and painting.</p>
