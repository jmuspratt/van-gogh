  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I congratulate you with all my heart on the silver medal you
    received in London. It is a satisfaction to me to know that I
    said what I did about that picture at the time. And I repeated
    it only a short while ago, I mean during that conversation on
    Friday when I said, &ldquo;I have found something in the
    <i>colour</i> of that picture of the `Woman Spinning' that
    seems <i>better</i> and <i>sounder</i> to me than what I have
    seen you paint here.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Yet the &ldquo;Little Weaver&rdquo; is another exception to
    this, which I also stipulated at the time.</p>

    <p>Starting a picture in a low pitch, and then trying to
    elevate it from this low key upward - I found this system in
    the &ldquo;Woman Spinning&rdquo; at the time, although it was a
    very original method of doing things. I reminded you of that
    picture that Friday. &ldquo;There are prodigious forces in
    it,&rdquo; I said. And that is what I have missed now and then
    in your later work.</p>

    <p>I think of your visit here with great pleasure, and I don't
    doubt that the more you come here the more you will feel
    attracted to nature.</p>

    <p>Since your departure I have been working on a water mill [F
    048a, JH 488] - the one I inquired about in that little bar
    near the station, where we sat chatting with that man who I
    told you seemed to labour under a chronic shortage of small
    change in his pocket.</p>

    <p>It is the same motif as the other two water mills we went to
    look at together, but this one has <i>two red</i> roofs, and
    you see it right from the front - with poplars around it. Even
    in autumn it will be superb.</p>

    <p>Thanks for sending off the books.</p>

    <p><i>Perhaps</i> my brother Theo will come here during
    Whitsuntide, but not for longer than that, and only if he can
    manage to have the two days off. He will be delighted to hear
    you have been awarded a prize, as we all are.</p>

    <p>Adieu. Write soon. Believe me, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
