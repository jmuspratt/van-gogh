  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I can hardly call it friendly that you haven't written me a
    single word in all this time; but as I suppose you will agree
    with me on this point more or less, I will not pursue the
    subject right now. Another matter is that my mother's recovery
    is progressing better than was expected in the beginning. And
    the doctor says that he now dares assure us that she will be
    well again in about three months.</p>

    <p>I have thought repeatedly about the fact that we made some
    sort of agreement that I was to send you a few watercolours
    this winter. But, as I heard absolutely nothing from you, I
    must tell you frankly that I did not feel the slightest
    inclination to do so. So the whole thing came to nothing -
    although I have done some.</p>

    <p>I have mostly been painting these past weeks - those weavers
    - it was rather a laborious job. And during these last mild
    days I have been painting in the fields: a little country
    churchyard.</p>

    <p>Five pen drawings of weavers besides.</p>

    <p>I haven't found many more wood engravings this winter -
    except one very beautiful sheet by O'Kelly, &ldquo;Irish
    Emigrants&rdquo; - and one by Emslie, &ldquo;A Cotton
    Mill,&rdquo; and then the sheet in the Christmas number of the
    Graphic<i>,</i> <i>&ldquo;For Those in Peril upon the
    Sea&rdquo;</i> [written in English].</p>

    <p>Do you know the poems of Jules Breton - &ldquo;Les
    Humbles&rdquo; and &ldquo;Promenade&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;Int&eacute;rieurs&rdquo;? - I read them again recently
    together with another little volume of French poems by
    Fran&ccedil;ois Copp&eacute;e. Copp&eacute;e's are very
    beautiful too. Characterizations of workmen - also demimonde
    with a great deal of sentiment in it.</p>

    <p>Have you been so busy with your Dominican monk - or what is
    the reason you haven't written?</p>

    <p>Good-by,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>[On the back of the envelope]</p>

    <p>P.S. I have also got hold of a spinning wheel.</p>
