  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Look here, this will not do. <label content="Theo.mistress">In your letter you speak about
    an &ldquo;amour tra&icirc;nant&rdquo; [flagging love] and that
    when you had to face that question, you finally broke it off.
    Well, this as at least a manly action.</label></p>

    <p>I am involved - not exactly with an &ldquo;amour
    tra&icirc;nant&rdquo; - but with an &ldquo;amiti&eacute;
    tra&icirc;nant.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Don't you think we might apply the same system to it?</p>

    <p>One of the things of which I say &ldquo;this will not
    do&rdquo; is that you send me a third of the money, and write,
    &ldquo;I could send you the rest, but it suits me better to do
    so toward the end of the month, if it doesn't inconvenience
    you.&rdquo; Now must you ask me if it suits me or not? You know
    yourself how last month I used three-quarters of the money to
    pay things off. But I did not complain, not even when the money
    arrived as late as March 10.</p>

    <p>But now, when I promised to pay various other things in
    March which I owed when I came here, to have to wait now till
    the end of the month again, whether that is exactly a piece of
    good fortune for me, I leave you to decide.</p>

    <p>Allons, Brother - I suppose you will not think it
    &ldquo;brotherly&rdquo; of me if I class our friendship, such
    as it is at present, very decidedly among the things without
    pith and marrow - but in the past I should have been greatly
    worried by that question of being brotherly or not brotherly.
    And now - I shall not be worried by it. And I shall feel pretty
    indifferent to what you think of my doings. I know that for
    myself, just because we began as friends and with a feeling of
    mutual respect - I know that for myself I will not suffer its
    degenerating into protection - I decline to be your
    prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Theo. Why? Because! And more and more it
    threatens to degenerate into this.</p>

    <p>What you say about my work is silly - I call it silly when
    you tell me how the Salon's jury would judge my work when I
    never said a syllable about sending it to the Salon - I think
    it silly and insipid&hellip;oh, there are more things I think
    silly and insipid, and then the other part is the concluding
    nice little compliment of this type - if I did this or that, I
    should be the person to make you feel more at peace with this,
    that and the other thing.</p>

    <p>If you do not care so much for Lhermitte any more, I tell
    you that the fault lies with you. I agree with you that I rate
    Millet perhaps even higher, but damn! To see so many things of
    Lhermitte's as you do, and not to be sufficiently impressed, to
    forget all comparisons - I call that narrow-minded. Something
    which, for that matter, you are going to be subject to more and
    more, I fear.</p>

    <p>I never mentioned sending my work to the Salon, did I? But I
    did speak to you at the time about the people at the
    illustrated papers, especially about Buhot. And I don't take it
    back that I urged you to do so.</p>

    <p>If you meant it seriously that, after another period of hard
    work on my part, you would try to show my drawings, I should be
    perfectly willing not to bring them before the public before we
    had some thoroughly good drawings.</p>

    <p>On one condition, however - that in the meantime my life
    would not be too lonesome and miserable, my position not too
    false, but that I could accept the present with a sense of
    freedom. But how is it at present? You do <i>absolutely
    nothing</i> to procure me some distraction, which I sometimes
    need so badly, by meeting people, or seeing things.</p>

    <p>In short, I feel that nothing would please you more than my
    not bringing myself to your personal notice.</p>

    <p>It has already been this way for more than a year, and now
    the reaction is that I say, None of it's of any use this way -
    <i>neither for you nor for me</i>, and it would be stupid to go
    on in this way, stupid!</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">When I read over the letters you've sent me recently, I see
    in them that you exert yourself to make it look as though I am
    the one to blame if we part company.</p>

    <p>This is such a dear little Van Goghish trick, such a nice
    bit of self-righteousness;</label> for my part I shall not grudge you
    it if it means something to you. Father would do the same. I
    know for myself what I have felt during the past year, and what
    my thoughts are about our friendship - <i>as it is now</i> -
    <i>unbearable</i>.</p>

    <p>Whatever may be thought about whether I do right or wrong in
    speaking as I do, at any rate <i>I'm the one who's taking a
    chance</i>. Theo, it is more convenient for you to be
    completely rid of me - personally, if I break with you,
    especially in financial matters, I have absolutely nothing
    else, and such a way of doing things is the opposite of the
    usual tactics of Messrs. Van Gogh &amp; Co.</p>

    <p><i>Take this in whatever way you like</i>
    &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

    <p>Conclusion: You indicate that if my drawings were so
    beautiful that you could put them next to Millet's and
    Daumier's, you would occupy yourself with them.</p>

    <p>Of course I on my part am willing to believe this, but at
    the same time I know something else - that in that case there
    are other fellows whom I could apply to. And if you try to make
    it appear that the house of Goupil &amp; Co. deals principally
    in the Millet and Daumier type of art, I tell you that Messrs.
    G. &amp; Co. <i>most certainly</i> did <i>not</i> occupy
    themselves with Millet <i>at the time</i>, before the big
    Millet sales - and they did about as little for Daumier. Then,
    in Daumier's and Millet's younger days, Messrs. G. &amp; Co.
    were busily occupied with Julien Brochard and <i>Monsieur</i>
    Paul Delaroche - in my eyes not such a very fine
    <i>Monsieur</i> Delaroche, you know. So much for the house of
    G. &amp; Co.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I know beforehand that I shall be sorry, and at times even
    very sorry if we part.</p>

    <p>And perhaps - although in your case no inconvenience and
    cares are involved - you on your part might think it more or
    less unpleasant.</p>

    <p>But having called the thing by its true name, amiti&eacute;
    tra&icirc;nante, half-hearted friendship, what is left except
    separation? And to tell you the truth, I have repeatedly
    thought that things would become impossible between you and me
    unless I could renew some relation, however slight, with Goupil
    &amp; Co. - Goupil &amp; Co., toward whom after all I have
    never misbehaved myself, except that during six long years I
    worked for them to the best of my ability. Which was most
    certainly a serious misdemeanour on my part, and surely a
    sufficient reason for hating each other, hein? - such is
    commerce after all.</p>

    <p>But you were too high and mighty to take the slightest
    notice not only of my work but also of what I told you about
    what happened to me during these last years in The Hague, which
    might and should have been redressed.</p>

    <p>Speaking of &ldquo;brotherly,&rdquo; do such things belong
    among the brotherlinesses? And can I think otherwise than that
    it's more and more insufferable of you to write something like,
    <i>Therefore</i> have a little patience?</p>

    <p>Look here, I need my patience for my work, my friend, and if
    I am a little short with you and others, the reason is that I
    think it mean to put a fellow off with fair words, such fair
    words as, Therefore have a little patience.</p>

    <p>So now I am quarreling with you - and high time too.</p>

    <p>In the beginning you used to show my drawings to Heyerdahl -
    to Buhot - why not later?</p>

    <p>Really and truly I am furious that you have been so terribly
    lax since then - I am furious for this reason - it is not
    because of anything else - it is because of that damned way you
    have of saying over and over again, &ldquo;Keep on
    working,&rdquo; &ldquo;have a little patience,&rdquo; whereas
    in the meantime you do not lift a finger to see that I get
    satisfaction out of my work.</p>
