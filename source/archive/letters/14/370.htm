  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I still think of your pleasant visit very often, which I hope will soon be repeated,
    and then for a somewhat longer time.</p>

    <p>Since you were here, I have been working hard on <art id=1139>the figure
    of a woman spinning</art>, of which I enclose a scratch.</p>

    <p>It is fairly large sized, and painted in a dark tone; the
    figure is dressed in blue, with a mouse-coloured shawl.</p>

    <p><art id=1140>I hope to make another one, of an old man at the spooling
    wheel, near a little window</art>, <art id=1138>of which you perhaps remember a
    small study.</art></p>

    <p>I should be very glad to receive the measures of your frames
    soon, then I should be able to get going. Perhaps if the
    measure fits, I shall make a small one of that woman
    spinning.</p>

    <p>I just copy for you the following passage from Les artistes
    de mon temps by Ch. Blanc.</p>

    <p>Trois mois environ avant la mort d'Eug. Delacroix, nous le
    rencontr&acirc;mes dans les galeries du palais Royal, sur les
    dix heures du soir, Paul Chenavard et moi. C'&eacute;tait au
    sortir d'un grand diner o&ugrave; l'on avait agit&eacute; des
    questions d'art, et la conversation s'&eacute;tait
    prolong&eacute;e entre nous deux sur le m&ecirc;me sujet, avec
    cette vivacit&eacute;, cette chaleur, que l'on met surtout aux
    discussions inutiles. Nous en &eacute;tions &agrave; la
    couleur, et je disais:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Pour moi les grands colouristes sont ceux, qui ne
    font pas le ton local,&rdquo; et j'allais d&eacute;velopper mon
    th&egrave;me, lorsque nous aper&ccedil;umes Eug&egrave;ne
    Delacroix dans la galerie de la Rotunde.</p>

    <p>Il vint &agrave; nous en s'&eacute;criant: je suis s&ucirc;r
    qu'ils parlent peinture. En effet, lui dis-je, j'&eacute;tais
    sur le point de soutenir une proposition qui n'est pas, je
    crois, un paradoxe, et dont vous &ecirc;tes en tout cas
    meilleur juge que personne; je disais que les grands
    colouristes ne font pas le ton local, et avec vous je n'ai pas
    besoin sans doute d'aller plus loin.</p>

    <p>Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix fit deux pas en arri&egrave;re,
    selon son habitude en clignant les yeux: &ldquo;Cela est
    parfaitement vrai,&rdquo; dit-il, &ldquo;voil&agrave; un ton
    par exemple (il montrait du doigt le ton gris et sale du
    pav&eacute;), eh bien, si l'on disait &agrave; Paul
    Veron&egrave;se: peignez-moi une belle femme blonde dont la
    chair soit de ce ton-l&agrave;; il la peindrait, et la femme
    <i>serait une blonde dans son tableau</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>[About three months before his death, Paul Chenavard and I
    met Eug. Delacroix in the Palais Royal galleries, about ten
    o'clock in the evening. It was after a big dinner, during which
    questions of art had been debated, and the conversation on the
    subject had been prolonged between us, with the liveliness and
    warmth which people tend to do in useless discussions. We were
    talking about colour, and I said:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;For me, the great colourists are those who don't
    paint local colour,&rdquo; and I was getting ready to enlarge
    on my theme, when we caught sight of Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix in
    the Rotonde gallery.</p>

    <p>He came toward us, crying: I'm sure you are talking about
    painting. In effect, I told him. I was at the point of
    defending a proposition which is not, I think, a paradox, and
    of which you are a better judge than anyone; I said that the
    great colourists don't paint local colour, and with you I don't
    need to go any further.</p>

    <p>Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix took two steps backwards, as was his
    habit, and blinking his eyes: &ldquo;That is perfectly
    true,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is a tone, for instance (he
    pointed his finger to a grey and dirty tone of the pavement),
    very well, if one said to Paul Veronese: paint me a beautiful
    blonde woman whose flesh has that tone, he would paint her, and
    the woman <i>would be a blonde in his painting</i>.&rdquo;]</p>

    <p>As to drab colour, in my opinion, one must not judge the
    colours of a painting separately; a drab colour, for instance,
    next to a strong brownish-red, a dark blue or olive-green may
    express the very delicate, fresh green of a meadow or a little
    cornfield.</p>

    <p>And yet I believe De Bock, who baptized certain colours
    &ldquo;drab colours,&rdquo; certainly would not contradict this
    - for I myself heard him say once that in some pictures by
    Corot, for instance in evening skies, there are colours which
    are very luminous in the picture and, considered
    <i>separately</i>, are in fact of a <i>rather dark, greyish
    tone</i>.</p>

    <p>Father and Mother will write you soon and thank you for your
    letter.</p>

    <p>But to revert to that question of painting an evening sky,
    or a blonde woman with a drab colour like the grey of the
    pavement, if one considers it well, that question has a
    <i>double</i> meaning.</p>

    <p>In the first place:</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">A dark colour may seem <i>light</i>, or rather give that
    <i>effect</i>; this is in fact more a question of <i>tone</i>.
    But then, as regards the real <i>colour</i>, a reddish-grey,
    hardly red at all, will appear more or less red according to
    the colours next to it.</p>

    <p>And it is the same with blue and yellow.</label></p>

    <p>One has to put but a very little yellow into a colour to
    make it seem very yellow if one puts that colour in or next to
    a violet or a lilac tone.</p>

    <p>I remember how somebody tried to paint a red roof, on which
    the light was falling, by means of vermilion and chrome, etc.!
    That didn't work.</p>

    <p>Jaap Maris did it in many a watercolour, by putting a very
    little highlight of red-ochre on a colour that was reddish. And
    it expressed the sunlight on the red roofs perfectly.</p>

    <p>As soon as I have time, I shall copy another part of that
    article on Delacroix, about the laws which always remain true
    for colours. I sometimes think that when people speak about
    <i>colour</i>, they really mean <i>tone</i>.</p>

    <p>And perhaps at present there are more <i>ton</i>ists than
    <i>colour</i>ists.</p>

    <p>This is not the same, though they may easily go
    together.</p>

    <p>I quite agree with you that nowadays it is often very hard
    to satisfy the need to talk with people who <i>know</i> how to
    give advice and from whom one <i>learns</i> and gets
    <i>light</i> without their playing the schoolmaster, or without
    their using nothing but big empty words, which are, after all,
    banalities or platitudes.</p>

    <p>Well, but <i>nature</i> is a thing about which one can learn
    a great deal. Goodbye, please don't forget the <i>rabbet</i>
    measure of your frames. Believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
