  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Here are two more cartes-de-visite, to give you an idea of
    that decoration for Hermans, of which these two paintings are
    part.</p>

    <p>Right now Rappard is here and sends his regards. He has made
    a very beautiful study of a girl's head, and one of a farmyard,
    and two small ones of ox wagons. And he intends to make several
    more that will follow.</p>

    <p>I am working on the figure of a shepherd with a wide cloak,
    which is of the same size as the woman spinning.</p>

    <p>And in addition, a study of two pollard willows, with the
    yellow leaves of poplars behind, and a glimpse of the
    fields.</p>

    <p>It is extraordinarily beautiful here at present, with the
    autumn effects. In a fortnight's time we shall have the real
    <i>ch&ucirc;te des feuilles</i> [fall of leaves] when all the
    leaves on the trees fall off in a few days.</p>

    <p>If I have some luck with that shepherd, it will become a
    figure in which there will be something of the <i>very old
    Brabant</i>. In short, it is not ready yet, and we shall see
    how it turns out.</p>

    <p>I think you might have just replied in a few words to what I
    wrote the other day, if only to clear up your own ideas
    perhaps. For my part, in spite of much old and new sorrow, I
    feel less and less doubt about my own future, both as to my
    work and as to myself.</p>

    <p>But I know that in both respects I shall have a hard fight,
    that both my work and myself will meet with much opposition,
    will make a bad impression in <i>many</i> cases, though <i>not
    in all</i>.</p>

    <p>And as to my work, every day I become keener on it, and I
    get back my high spirits, as if <i>I were twenty</i>.</p>

    <p>By all means I must manage to go to Antwerp sometime; often
    enough in the past I sold things that the experts had declared
    unsaleable. If I <i>wanted</i> to sell a thing then, it did not
    always fall through, if I really wanted someone to take a
    certain thing. And perhaps you are right, that I had better
    find my own way for my work, and in short, become my own
    dealer. Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
