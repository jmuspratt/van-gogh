    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">I was glad to hear from your letter to Father and Mother
    that you intend to go to London on August 4,</label> and from there
    will come here. I am again longing very much for your coming,
    and to know what you will think of the work that I have done
    since.</p>

    <p>The last things I have done are two rather large studies of
    ox wagons, <art id=0039>a black ox</art> and <art id=0038>a red one</art>.</p>

    <p>I have also been working again on <art id=0040>the old church steeple in
    the fields</art>, in the evening, of which I made a larger study than
    <art id=0088>the previous one</art>, with the cornfields around it.</p>

    <p>Rappard sent me back the book by Vosmaer which belongs to
    you; I started reading it, and perhaps it is my fault, but I
    think it awfully dull, and written in a regular academic,
    sermonizing tone. Perhaps you will think so too when you read
    it again.</p>

    <p>Have you read Sapho by Daudet?</p>

    <p>It is very beautiful, and so full of vigour, so &ldquo;la
    nature serr&eacute; de pr&egrave;s&rdquo; [nature pressed
    closely (to his heart)], that the heroine lives, breathes, and
    one <i>hears</i> her voice, literally <i>hears</i> it, and
    forgets one is <i>reading</i>.</p>

    <p>When you come, you will also see some new weavers.</p>

    <p>Nature is certainly very striking here; I am still much
    pleased with the studio.</p>

    <p>When you come, we must visit some farms and weaver's
    houses.</p>

    <p>In October Rappard intends to come back here, probably he is
    now in Drenthe again.</p>

    <p>Well, I am writing in rather a hurry, for I am up to my ears
    in my work. I work a good deal early in the morning or in the
    evening, and sometimes everything is so unutterably beautiful
    then.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
