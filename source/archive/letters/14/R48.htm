  <body>
    <p>Nuenen, 2<sup>nd</sup> half September 1884</p>

    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>With many thanks for letting me read them I am returning the
    book by Blanc and the one by Fromentin today. As I told you, in
    consequence of reading Artistes de mon Temps, I ordered the
    Grammaire des Arts du Dessin - you may read it if you like.</p>

    <p>I happened to be in Utrecht last week for a day with some
    others from the village. I called at your house, but I could
    not call again as I had to go back the same day. I found nobody
    home at your house, and I was very sorry that I could not take
    a look at any of your work as a result; I should have liked so
    much to see your large picture of the &ldquo;Fish
    Market.&rdquo; And they could not even tell me where you were,
    which is why I suppose you are still in Drenthe.</p>

    <p>I should have liked at the same time to talk to you about
    staying with us, to find out whether you feel like coming or
    not. I already wrote you about it, but the two letters have not
    been answered.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I very much enjoyed working on the six canvases I wrote you
    about, and now the painted sketches are finished, all six of
    them, and are already at my art lover's house; after he has
    copied them they will remain my property, and I am going to put
    some final touches on them. The subjects are &ldquo;Potato
    Planting,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ox Plough,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wheat
    Harvest,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sower,&rdquo; &ldquo;Shepherd&rdquo;
    (storm effect), &ldquo;Gatherers of Dead Wood&rdquo; (snow
    effect).</p>

    <p>I have felt a bit cramped, as I had to stick to certain
    fixed measurements, and also because my art lover preferred
    compositions with five or six figures, for instance, whereas I
    myself would rather have done two or three. But despite that I
    have worked on them with real pleasure, and I shall carry them
    still further.</p>
