  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Last night I came back to Nuenen, and I must tell you at
    once what I have on my mind.</p>

    <p>I packed my painting materials, studies, etc., at The Hague,
    and sent them here, and Father and Mother having cleared the
    little room, I am already settled in that new studio, where I
    hope I shall be able to make some progress. Then I must tell
    you that I have seen the woman, and that we have decided more
    definitely than ever to live apart, at least so that the world
    cannot justifiably find fault with it.</p>

    <p>Once separated, we shall remain so, but we regret not having
    chosen a middle course after all, and even now an attachment
    remains which is too deeply rooted to pass away.</p>

    <p>I now have to say a number of things that I shall not refer
    to after this - which you may take any way you like - which you
    will be free to think over or to dismiss from your mind -
    that's no affair of mine - decide for yourself.</p>

    <p>Know then that I look back on your visit of last summer, on
    our conversations at the time, and on what resulted from them
    with deep regret. Time has passed over it, but on looking back
    I cannot deny that in my opinion we did not act rightly. And
    now I look upon your words and yourself somewhat differently,
    and I cannot think of you with exactly the same feelings as in
    the past.</p>

    <p>The fact is that now I see more clearly that you and others
    seemed to wish I should part company with her.</p>

    <p>I do not doubt your good intentions.</p>

    <p>The decision lay with me, and if I did what I think was
    wrong, you are not the <i>first</i> I should reproach with it
    (I reproach myself <i>first</i>), but then you <i>second</i>.
    The levers that were applied to my mind, so that I lost my
    self-command - in which you were concerned at least to a
    certain extent - were firstly, that touching upon an infinitely
    tender affair of the past, which disturbed me, and secondly,
    your saying that perhaps &ldquo;my duty&rdquo; would force me
    to part.</p>

    <p>Well - if what you said then were an isolated occurrence, I
    should not feel induced to refer to it - but it tallies too
    much with the opinions of others with whom I disagree for me to
    regard your opinions as wholly independent. I accepted your
    point of view - although I suppose with intentions quite
    different from what you imagine, concerning which time will
    clarify certain things for you that it would be premature to
    discuss now.</p>

    <p>You pointed out a certain case to me in which &ldquo;it had
    worked,&rdquo; namely that a certain man had left a certain
    woman.</p>

    <p>This may be true in itself - very true even - but <i>in this
    case</i> it was not relevant, look, to her and me that is
    another matter. And I have taken the liberty of thinking over
    &ldquo;whether it has worked.&rdquo; And, my friend, this is
    exceedingly doubtful.</p>

    <p>I can tell you that the woman has behaved well, <i>has
    worked</i> as a washerwoman to earn a living for herself and
    the children, so that she has done her duty, notwithstanding
    great physical weakness.</p>

    <p>You know that I took her into my house because, at her
    confinement, things had happened which made the doctor at
    Leyden advise her to stay in some quiet place, for her own sake
    and for that of the baby.</p>

    <p>There was anemia, and perhaps the beginning of consumption;
    well, as long as I was with her, she did not grow worse, but in
    many respects stronger, so that several ugly symptoms
    disappeared.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.guilt">But now everything has changed for the worse, and I fear for
    her life; and the poor little baby too, whom I cared for as if
    he were my own, is no longer what he was.</p>

    <p>Brother, I found her in great misery, and I am in great
    sorrow over her. I know, of course, that it is more my own
    fault than anyone else's, but you too might have spoken
    differently.</label></p>

    <p>Now that it is too late, I understand better some fits of
    temper in her, and some things which I thought she did wrong on
    purpose I now see as nervous symptoms, done almost
    unconsciously.</p>

    <p>Just as she told me on more than one occasion afterward,
    &ldquo;Sometimes <i>I do not know what I do</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>For me, as well as for you, there is an excuse in the fact
    that one does not know to what extent such a woman can be
    relied upon, and in the financial obstacles besides - but we
    should have chosen a middle course, and if we could still find
    it - though it will be difficult to find now - it would be more
    humane and less cruel. However, I did not want to give her
    hope, and I have encouraged her and tried to comfort and
    fortify her <i>on the path which she follows now</i>, living
    alone, working for herself and her children. But my heart goes
    out to her in the same great pity as it used to do, a pity
    which has been alive in me all these past months, even after
    our separation.</p>

    <p>Well, our friendship, brother, has received a bad shock from
    this, and if you were to say we certainly did not make a
    mistake, and if it should appear to me that you are still in
    the same frame of mind - then I should not be able to respect
    you as much as in the past. Because at the time I respected you
    for the very fact that, at a moment when others cut me because
    of my being with her, you were the one to help me keep her
    alive. I do not say there was no need for a change or a
    modification, but - I think we, or rather I, have gone too
    far.</p>

    <p>As I now have a studio here, more than one financial
    difficulty is less ruinous perhaps.</p>

    <p>I will end by saying: Please think it over - but if your
    state of mind remains the same as last summer after what I have
    said, I cannot feel the same respect for you as in the past.
    For the rest, I have resolved never to speak another word with
    you about the possible change in your circumstances and your
    career, for it is as if I see two natures in you, struggling
    within your breast - a phenomenon I perceive in myself too, but
    it may be that some problems are solved because of my being
    four years older, problems which in your case are more or less
    in a state of ferment. Think over what I have said, that would
    be excellent - but you can also dismiss it from your mind.
    However, for my part I wanted to speak frankly about it, and I
    cannot conceal my feelings from you.</p>

    <p>As to my opinion how far one <i>may</i> go in a case of
    helping a poor, forsaken, sick creature, I can only repeat what
    I told you already on a former occasion: <i>infinitely</i>.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, our cruelty can be infinite too.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
