  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am working very hard on the series of heads from the
    people, which I have set myself to make; I just enclose a
    little scratch of the last one; in the evening I generally
    scratch them from memory on a little scrap of paper, this is
    one of them.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I will make them later on in watercolour too. But
    first I must paint them. <label content="art.influences">Now just listen - do you remember how
    in the very beginning I always spoke to you about my great
    respect and sympathy for the work of Father de Groux? Of late I
    think of him <i>more than ever</i>. One must not confront him
    only in his historical pictures, though these are also very
    good, nor in the first instance in a few pictures with the
    sentiment of, for instance, the author Conscience. But one must
    see his &ldquo;Grace before Meat,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
    Pilgrimage,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Paupers' Bench&rdquo; and above
    all, the simple Brabant types. De Groux is appreciated as
    little as, for instance, Thijs Mans. He is different though,
    but this they have in common, that they met with violent
    opposition.</label></p>

    <p>In these days - whether the public is wiser now I can't
    tell, but this much I know, that it is not at all superfluous
    to weigh seriously one's thoughts and one's actions.</p>

    <p>And at this very moment I could tell you some new names of
    people that hammer again on the same old anvil on which de
    Groux hammered. If it had pleased de Groux at that time to
    dress his Brabant characters in medieval costumes, he would
    have run parallel with Leys in genius, and also in fortune.</p>

    <p>However, he did not do so, and <i>now</i>, years afterwards,
    there is a considerable reaction against that medievalism,
    though Leys always remains Leys and Thijs Maris, Thijs Maris,
    and Victor Hugo's Notre Dame, Notre Dame.</p>

    <p>But the realism <i>not wanted</i> then is <i>in demand</i>
    now, and there is more need of it than ever.</p>

    <p>The realism that has character and a serious sentiment.</p>

    <p>I can tell you that for my part I will try to keep a
    straight course, and will paint the most simple, the most
    common things.</p>

    <p>For pity's sake, how is it possible that you do not seem
    able or willing to understand that by having fixed my studio
    here, and by keeping it here for the present, I have made it
    possible to have money enough for painting, and if I had done
    otherwise it would have been a failure for myself as well as
    for others. If I had not done so I would have had to drudge at
    least three years more, before I had definitely overcome the
    difficulties of colour and tone, just because of the expenses.
    It is now just a year ago since I came here, driven by
    necessity. It is certainly not for my <i>pleasure</i> that I
    live here at home, but for my painting, and this being so I
    think it a great mistake of yours if you were to rob me of an
    opportunity, if I had to leave here <i>now</i>, before I had
    found something else. For my painting I must stay here somewhat
    longer still, then as soon as I have made more definite
    progress, I am willing to go anywhere where I shall earn the
    same money that I have here.</p>

    <p>To be put back is not what I need or deserve, nor do I feel
    the least inclination for it, you see.</p>

    <p>And attempt to get rid of you, that I never did, but where
    you showed me too clearly how little chance there was of our
    doing real business together, I do accept it for the future,
    that is true.</p>

    <p>Recognize this once and for all, when I ask you for money,
    do not ask it for <i>nothing</i>; the work which I carry out
    with it is at your disposal, and if <i>now</i> I am in arrears,
    I am on the right road even to achieving some leeway.</p>

    <p>I write this once more, for the same reason as I did the
    earlier letters; I shall be quite at bay at the end of the
    month, for I have only enough for two or three days to pay my
    model.</p>

    <p>And I am wretched that I shall again be handicapped for ten
    or twelve days this month.</p>

    <p>And most seriously I repeat, can you not find a way to help
    me to 20 francs, for instance, to cover those last days? What I
    mind most, is the time I should otherwise forfeit. Goodbye.</p>

    <p>Yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
