  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Mind you, I mean what I say about the woman.</p>

    <p>Mind you, all the disappointment that your visit of last
    summer caused me (more than you know) is something that does
    not count seriously with me - as far as I myself was concerned
    - but the other thing - namely finding her in such a condition
    that my heart melted in my breast - that - it will remain
    something insuperable between you and me - <i>unless she can
    still be saved</i>. At the time you were frivolous when
    uttering your words - you did not think over what you said, and
    evidently spoke on insufficient grounds - and what do I think
    about it? I tell you without reserve that you have this much in
    common with Father, who often acts in the same way, that you
    are <i>cruel</i> in your worldly wisdom.</p>

    <p>Cruel, I repeat the word, for what can be more cruel than
    depriving such an unfortunate and withered woman and her little
    child of support. Don't think you will be able to delude
    yourself into the belief that it was nothing, or only my
    imagination. Don't think it will help you if you reason that it
    was only a question of a faded whore and of bastards. So much
    the more motive for deep compassion - which I showed for that
    matter.</p>

    <p>I have only just noticed that during all that time you have
    not written <i>a single word</i> about her, and that you <i>did
    not reply</i> when I wrote you that I had heard from her.</p>

    <p>And there are more things that I have only just noticed
    <i>now</i>, and <i>because</i> I notice them now, I no longer
    address you in the same tone as formerly.</p>

    <p>Oh, I know that to a certain extent you did it with good
    intentions - I know how you always try to keep the peace with
    everybody (which I don't believe can be done) - I know that
    even in this case you probably haven't got the faintest notion
    that you did something that was not right - but being good
    friends with the world and following our conscience just
    <i>don't</i> go together - you do not give your
    <i>conscience</i> its due.</p>

    <p>I also know that not everybody in my case and in my
    circumstances would dare contradict you, but granted that not
    everybody would do so, I for my part want to tell you that
    there is something in you that I object to, and that in general
    I warn you against your &ldquo;politics.&rdquo; Which I think
    <i>too</i> politic.</p>

    <p>For I foresee later on (perhaps much later on) you will be
    sorry for many things you think right now. Why do I think so?
    For the time being I need not give a reason because you would
    not believe me.</p>

    <p>The period of separation has spoiled most of what I had
    gained for her preservation, and this makes matters even more
    difficult. Can anything be done about it now? But in what
    way?</p>

    <p>Truly, it is not a question of money alone, for the poor
    woman also misses myself too, the way I was to her and her
    children, that is to say, I had an affection for them, just as
    I now feel an equal and even greater affection for them.</p>

    <p>What you wrote in a certain letter about &ldquo;that I
    should render her and myself a disservice,&rdquo; kindly take
    it back, bearing in mind the service you rendered her last
    summer, her, her children and myself - really you cannot be too
    silent about it!</p>

    <p>Moreover, you <i>presume</i> in the letter in question,
    which contains the only reference to her that you have written
    since last summer - you <i>presume</i> that I should like to
    take &ldquo;that person,&rdquo; as you called her, with me to
    Drenthe. I should not be able to, <i>even if I wanted to</i>,
    because I haven't got the money for it.</p>

    <p>As regards the money - brother - you will understand that I
    no longer take any pleasure in it, won't you? You do understand
    this thoroughly, don't you? I took pleasure in it because it
    served to keep not only myself but also these poor creatures
    safe.</p>

    <p>This is a sad letter at the end of the year - sad for me to
    write, sad for you to receive (although you are at liberty to
    dismiss it from your thoughts; this is something you must
    decide for yourself), but it is worse for the poor woman.</p>

    <p>Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I have received more news from her, for I sent her to a
    doctor, and now I have heard particulars about it.</p>

    <p>Further, brother, my answer to your intimation that a
    calamity which threatened you had been averted - you know that
    my answer was cool; in this matter I have no other answer than,
    &ldquo;So much the worse for you, my friend.&rdquo; Perhaps you
    will understand why later on. I do not say it would not have
    been a calamity, but&hellip;There are moments in life when it
    is better that the blow is dealt, even if it be a hard blow,
    rather than that one is forced into the position of one who is
    <i>spared</i> by the world, I think.</p>

    <p>As for me, I am chained to misfortune and failure; it is
    damned hard at times, but never mind, for all that I do not
    envy the so-called fortunates and the ever successful, as I can
    see through it too much. Take &ldquo;The Prisoner&rdquo; by
    G&eacute;r&ocirc;me - the man lying fettered is most certainly
    in an unpleasant situation, but to my way of thinking he is in
    a better condition than the fellow who has the upper hand and
    is harassing him. I tell you this in order to point out the
    extremes of certain conditions. I am far from confusing my own
    fate, for instance, with the terribly aggravated misery of the
    prisoner. Notwithstanding which, something of what I want to
    point out may be seen in our society.</p>

    <p>As to me, I <i>do not congratulate</i> you on the fact that
    it may be expected that you will be able to keep the peace with
    certain authorities. It appeared to me that it was not
    superfluous to explain myself to you. You can interpret this
    precisely as you like.</p>

    <p>I do not forget either that at first you had compassion for
    the woman in question. But the very fact that I was and am far
    from blind to her faults, and notwithstanding this tried and am
    trying to save her, ought to have induced you, I think, to
    respect my feelings more and to understand them better - in
    that case you would have been able to stand up for me more
    resolutely against those who knew less about it than you, and
    for me things would not have come to such a pass that I <i>had
    to</i> give it up.</p>

    <p>Now I caution you, because perhaps it is not too late yet;
    if things become worse, the time for cautioning will be
    past.</p>
