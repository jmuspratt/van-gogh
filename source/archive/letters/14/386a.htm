  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>One cannot always find the right words to speak absolutely
    straightforwardly - but I am so firmly resolved to speak my
    mind to <i>you</i> without reserve - I don't give a damn
    whether you are suspicious or not - that after some
    consideration I have now perhaps found clearer words for the
    feelings I want to express.</p>

    <p>I believe that it is in <i>our mutual interest</i> that we
    separate.</p>

    <p>Your position - isn't this true? - does not admit of our
    associating with each other intimately, frequently, cordially.
    Your position - to mention only one thing by way of example -
    would not admit of my going to live at your house in Paris,
    let's say, either with the intention of studying or for
    financial reasons however necessary and useful it might be, and
    might become more and more, if circumstances permitted. For -
    against my person, my manners, clothes, words, you, like so
    many others, seem to think it necessary to raise so many
    objections - weighty enough and at the same time obviously
    without redress - that they have caused our personal, brotherly
    intercourse to wither and die off gradually in the course of
    the years. To this must be added my past, and that at Goupil
    &amp; Co.'s you are quite the plush gentleman, and I am a black
    sheep and an ill-natured fellow. Enough - this is how things
    are - aren't they? - and as here it is a question of
    analyzing, of manfully facing a situation, I suppose you are
    not going to contradict me in this matter.</p>

    <p>Only - but I do not mention this by way of reproach - the
    moment is not opportune for this - it is past - I just mention
    it for clarity's sake - only I had thought that you had
    attached some value to our not drifting <i>too far</i> apart -
    that by your being on the qui vive in this field, by executing
    some adroit maneuvers, you might have been able to find a more
    satisfactory solution for this ticklish problem. For instance,
    in such a way that I could have got I don't say on friendly
    terms, but at least into touch with Tersteeg and Mauve again,
    and so on. But - a struggle is going on in your mind about
    this, which you prefer not to be reminded of. So as to the
    point in question, you don't even dream of doing it, and you
    don't think it nice of me to take the liberty of referring to
    it. In any case you think me foolish in these things, and you
    won't touch them with a bargepole.</p>

    <p>This is the dark side of your character - I think you are
    mean in this respect - but the bright side of your character is
    your reliability in money matters.</p>

    <p>Ergo conclusion - I acknowledge being under an obligation to
    you with the greatest pleasure. Only - lacking relations with
    you, with Tersteeg, or with whomever I knew in the past - I
    want <i>something else</i> by way of compensation.</p>

    <p>For - personally I have to think of my future - I want to
    get on. If a hussy won't have me, it's all right with me; I can
    hardly take it ill of her - but nothing is more certain than
    that I shall try to find compensation elsewhere. And the same
    is true of other relations. I shall not obtrude myself upon
    <i>you</i>, neither shall I <i>force</i> you to be affectionate
    toward me - but - as a friend - let alone as a brother - you
    are too cool for my taste. Not as to money, old fellow; I am
    not speaking of that. But personally you aren't of the
    slightest use to me, nor am I to you. And it is possible, and
    it ought to be, that we should mean more to each other
    personally.</p>

    <p>Well, we won't quarrel over it - things have their periods -
    the period of quarreling is over - the period of parting
    follows, I think. But remember that there are fellows who most
    certainly love you, and whom you <i>ought not</i> to be
    suspicions of, whose sympathy becomes <i>powerless</i> because
    of your distrusting them too much, whereas you would do better
    if you strengthened a man's self-confidence. So much for
    that.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">I do not think it impossible that Marie - you know whom I
    mean, the one you helped when she was sick - notwithstanding
    full appreciation of your character and assistance, must have
    felt something of what I feel. Instinctively I dare suppose
    it.</label></p>

    <p>Now I will take the liberty to say <i>one</i> thing - we
    <i>shall separate</i> - for me this is a precarious transition
    - and one coupled with financial difficulties that will
    certainly be a great worry to me. However, I shall try to see
    things through - but I most decidedly demand of you that at
    this moment, which is critical for me, you on your part will be
    very frank. <i>I know that you will agree to our separation</i>
    - for the very reason that it will be settled peacefully.</p>

    <p>Tell me without reserve whether you approve of Antwerp -
    including my retaining my studio here in the country, which is
    too cheap to let go, and which for that matter I cannot do
    without as a storeroom and a refuge if necessary.</p>

    <p>And, if it is not asking too much, help me to see things
    through - financial embarrassment in this period, toward the
    end of the year, is always worse for me. I should wish the
    period of the transition to be short if possible, because it is
    torture to feel that one thing is disappearing and you haven't
    got the other. <label content="Theo.mistress">I cannot help thinking of the reason for Marie
    and you parting company. I don't know any details, do I? - but
    you did not think she was a good woman. Maybe you are right,
    but it may also be that you did <i>not understand her</i>.</label> And
    as for me, it is quite possible that similarly I am not a good
    man - this may well be - but in my case too, are you sure that
    you understand and feel the right way? I neither can nor will
    be the judge of this.</p>

    <p>In Proudhon you may read &ldquo;la femme est la
    d&eacute;solation du juste&rdquo; - but isn't it possible to
    answer this with, <i>The just is the desolation of woman</i>?
    Quite possible.</p>

    <p>And ditto ditto one might say, &ldquo;<i>The artist is the
    desolation of the financier</i>,&rdquo; and conversely,
    &ldquo;<i>The financier is the desolation of the
    artist</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>You see - I do not know the final solution myself - but I
    see two sides to one and the same problem.</p>

    <p>So you know my irrevocable intentions - for both our sakes I
    hope the time of transition will be short, and - because I know
    you agree to a separation - how can we act most quickly and
    satisfactorily?</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
