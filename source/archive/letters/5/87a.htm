    <p>Dear Uncle,</p>

    <p>When Pa was here the other day, he told me that you had
    asked him if Theo and I could come to see you someday. I am
    most anxious to see you and Aunt and talk with you both, and
    should therefore like to ask you whether it is convenient if
    Theo and I should take the first train from The Hague next
    Sunday and spend the afternoon or evening with you. Theo will
    have to go on a trip soon, and if we do not come now, it may
    not be possible for a long time.</p>

    <p>It was a glorious day when Pa was here recently; we took a
    walk together, and also went to the museum to see the pictures
    by Scheffer.</p>

    <p>All is well with me; at the beginning of the year there is a
    lot of work, so that I have to stay until twelve or one o'clock
    at night.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I like being in Holland
    again, although the work across the
    Channel, notwithstanding all the trouble and profound
    disappointment, was dear to me. It is still - because of the
    disappointment and relative failure this time, I am deeply
    attached to it.</label></p>

    <p>It is nice that Anna was able to find a situation so
    promptly too; I hope she will do well. If you agree to Theo and
    me coming next Sunday, kindly drop one of us a postcard; with
    kindest regards to you and Aunt, believe me in the meantime</p>

    <p>Your affectionate nephew, Vincent</p>

    <p>I should have written you about this sooner, but Pa did not
    ask me to go next Sunday until yesterday.</p>
  </body>
