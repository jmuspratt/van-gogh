  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter; I will make sure you find a note
    from me in Amsterdam. I hope we shall see each other next
    Sunday; it will be delightful to be together again.</p>

    <p>Many congratulations on Willemein's birthday - what a nice
    little girl she is getting to be. She will receive from home
    The Wide, Wide World, and I am sending her Christmas at the
    Pole by Bungener.</p>

    <p>I am glad that you are going on a business trip soon, it
    will be a nice change for you.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am so lonely and sad,&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;And
    yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It is good to think of Jesus in all places and
    circumstances. How difficult the life of the peasants in
    Brabant is, for instance, that of Aerssen <sup>1</sup>; what is
    the source of their strength? And those poor women, what
    supports them in life? Don't you think it is what the artist
    painted in his &ldquo;Light of the World&rdquo;?</p>

    <p>You do not know how I am drawn to the Bible; I read it
    daily, but I should like to know it by heart and to view life
    in the light of that phrase, &ldquo;Thy word is a light unto my
    path and a lamp unto my feet&rdquo; [<i>sic</i>, Ps. 119:105].
    I hope and believe that my life will be changed somehow, and
    that this longing for Him will be satisfied; <label content="psychology.depression">I too am sometimes
    sad and lonely, especially when I walk around a church or
    parsonage.</label></p>

    <p>Let's not give in, but try to be patient and gentle. And do
    not mind being eccentric; keep yourself to yourself, and
    distinguish between good and evil for your own sake even if you
    do not show it outwardly.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Do not depart from life without having openly
    demonstrated your love for Christ in some way or other,&rdquo;
    Claudius says.</p>

    <p>You have had an experience that can make you wise for a
    whole lifetime, do not forget it. &ldquo;Nourris-moi du pain de
    mes larmes, v&eacute;rit&eacute; enseignez moi&rdquo; [feed me
    on the bread of my tears, truth teach me].</p>

    <p>Hate sin; remember how Father prayed every morning,
    &ldquo;Deliver us from evil, especially from the evil of
    sin,&rdquo; and well he knows.</p>

    <p>I am looking forward to Sunday, and hope you will have a
    good journey. Work is always a good thing, &ldquo;There is
    something good in all labour.&rdquo; I am busy every day until
    late at night, but I am glad of it.</p>

    <p>The storks are here already, but I have not heard any larks
    yet. The sky is often stormy, and then one sees swarms of rooks
    and starlings.</p>

    <p>The photograph &ldquo;Mater Dolorosa&rdquo; which you sent
    me is hanging in my room. Do you remember, it was always
    hanging in Father's study at Zundert?</p>

    <p>Well, Theo, have a good time, we will see each other soon. I
    am eager to see the prints you write about; till Sunday,
    &agrave; Dieu, a handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
