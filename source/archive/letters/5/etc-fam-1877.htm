    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>7 May 1877</p>

    <p>We are having an agreeable time with Vincent, it is very
    cozy. On Monday morning [14<sup>th</sup> May] he will leave us.
    This morning again a nice letter from Uncle Jan; very kind and
    friendly also from Uncle Stricker; he has found a capable
    teacher, so that we now start the undertaking with courage,
    hoping for God's blessing.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">We have improved his appearance a little bit with the help
    of the best tailor from Breda.</label><label content="lifestyle.appearance"> Would you be so kind as to do
    another work of mercy and have his chevelure metamorphosed by a
    clever hairdresser - here in Etten we don't have such people. I
    suppose a barber of The Hague might be able to do something
    about it, therefore try to coax him into coming with you to
    one.</label></p>

    <p>It is not clear how we will manage; the teacher costs 1.50
    guilders per lesson, and every day a lesson makes nine guilders
    per week, and lessons in other subjects will probably also be
    necessary. We insist that Vincent pays visits to Tersteeg,
    Haanebeek and Mauve. Please collaborate! We hope Mrs. Tersteeg
    will be all right. Vincent hopes to arrive in The Hague on
    Monday afternoon around six o'clock. We wish him all the
    best!</p>

    <p>Mrs. van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>7 June 1877</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">Theo, Uncle [Vincent] loves you so much, I believe that
    after the disappointment with Vincent, the thought that you may
    succeed in his old favourite trade gives him a hope in life,
    something that is so important to him. Write him from time to
    time; that will give him pleasure, and tell him about
    everything; he is so nice to us that we should cooperate as far
    as we can to give him some joy in life.</label></p>
