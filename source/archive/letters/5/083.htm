  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Best wishes for the New Year, may it be a happy and
    prosperous in all respects. <label content="feelings.nostalgia">How delightful it was to meet
    again, how beautiful that morning you left was, and how often
    we shall recall that journey to Chaam.</label></p>

    <p>Father preached a beautiful sermon this morning!</p>

    <p>And now it is New Year's Eve, I wish you were here too.
    There is another thing I have to tell you. A few days ago Mr.
    Braat <sup>1</sup> from Dordrecht came to visit Uncle Vincent,
    and they talked about me; Uncle asked Mr. Braat If he had a
    place for me in his business, should I want one. Mr. Braat
    thought so, and said that I should just come and talk it over.
    So I went there early yesterday morning; I thought I could not
    let it go by without seeing what it was. We arranged that I
    should come for a week after New Year's to try it out, and
    after that we will see. It would be desirable, for several
    reasons, that I remain in Holland, near Father and Mother, you
    also, and the others. My salary would certainly be a bit higher
    that with Mr. Jones, and it is one's duty to think of that
    because later in life a man needs more.</p>

    <p>As for the religious work, I still do not give it up. Father
    has so many interests and he is so versatile, I hope that in
    whatever circumstances I may be, something similar will develop
    in me. The change will be that, instead of teaching the boys, I
    shall work in a bookshop.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">How often have we longed to be together, and how dreadful
    the feeling of being far from each other is in times of illness
    or care - as we felt it, for instance, during your illness -
    and then the feeling that want of the necessary money might be
    an obstacle to coming together in time of need.</label></p>

    <p>So it is quite possible that I shall go there.</p>

    <p>Yesterday evening I was at Uncle Vincent's to tell him that
    I had gone to Dordrecht at once. It was a stormy night; you can
    imagine how beautiful the road to Prinsenhage was with the dark
    clouds and their silver linings.</p>

    <p>I just entered for a minute the Catholic church where
    evening service was being held. It was a beautiful sight, all
    those peasants and peasant women in their black dresses and
    white caps, and the church looked so cheerful in the evening
    light.</p>

    <p>You must tell Mr. Tersteeg at once that I am going to
    Dordrecht for a week to try it. Wish him and Mrs. Tersteeg a
    happy New Year for me. I am writing in a great hurry, Anna and
    the girls went to Prinsenhage, and Father thought it better for
    me to go with them. Aunt came back with them in the carriage,
    and I walked with Willem Carbentus. Well, boy, my dear brother,
    what happy days we all had together. Have a pleasant New Year's
    Eve, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>More soon, &agrave; Dieu. If you write, address your letter
    to Dordrecht.</p>
