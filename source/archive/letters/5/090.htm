  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for the letter which I received yesterday; having
    some spare time, I answer it today.</p>

    <p>I remembered that when we were at the Van der Hoop museum we
    spoke about the book by Burger, so I am sending it to you by
    post. You will find in it another wood engraving after
    Dor&eacute;, Judith and Holophernes, and one after Brion for
    your collection. Keep up your collection, and you will have a
    fine one in time. <label content="feelings.nostalgia">Please
    accept my small contribution to it, I
    am so anxious to keep in touch with you through these little
    things - whenever I enter my little room the prints on the
    walls remind me of you. It is an old truth that the love
    between brothers is a strong support through life: let us seek
    that support. May experience strengthen the bond between us,
    let us be true and outspoken toward each other, and let us not
    have any secrets - just as it is now.</label></p>

    <p>Thanks for your last letter. &ldquo;It is not over
    yet,&rdquo; you say. No, it could not be over yet. Your heart
    will feel the need for confidence in itself and for unburdening
    itself - you will be hesitating between two roads: she or my
    father. As far as I am concerned, I believe that Father loves
    you more than she does - that his love is more valuable; it is
    pure gold:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    The child puts his faith in his father,<br>

    The father is worthy of faith,<br>

    For who is nearer than the father,<br>

    In the kingdom of God or on Earth.<br>

    [Dutch hymn]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>Do go there, whenever it becomes too much for you.</p>

    <p>This week I received a letter from Uncle Vincent, who wrote
    that he did not think that carrying on the correspondence
    served any purpose, because in this case he could not be of any
    assistance to me at all&hellip;There was also a letter from Mr.
    Gladwell about Harry, who must have suffered agonies and have
    been sorely tried to have acted as he did.</p>

    <p>Today Mr. G&ouml;rlitz went to Etten to speak to Father
    about the teaching vacancy at De Leur <sup>1</sup>. I hope with
    all my heart he will get it. I went to morning service today;
    the sermon was very beautiful, about Jesus appearing to his
    disciples at the sea of Tiberias (John 21).</p>

    <p>Enclosed are a few poems by Uhland which struck me.</p>

    <p>Write to me soon, my boy; kind regards to Roos, a handshake
    from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Enclosed are some flowers G&ouml;rlitz brought from
    Etten.</p>
