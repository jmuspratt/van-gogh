  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You did well to write to us. Bear up, my dear fellow, and
    always take an interest in life, also for our sakes. Oh, we can
    make things so pleasant for each other, isn't this a great aim
    in life?</p>

    <p>Theo, what do you say about Vincent's surprising us again?
    He ought to be careful.</p>

    <p>The key was to the churchyard, thanks. Kindest regards from
    Mother and everybody. Tomorrow Lies will have to leave.</p>

    <p>Ever your loving father, T. v. G.</p>
