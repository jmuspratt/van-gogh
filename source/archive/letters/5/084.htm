    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You probably expected a letter from me sooner. I am getting
    along pretty well at the bookstore and am very busy; I go there
    at eight o'clock in the morning and I leave at one o'clock at
    night. But I like it that way.</p>

    <p>I hope to go to Etten on 11 February, as you know, we
    celebrate this day as father's birthday. Will you be there
    also? I want to give him the Eliot's &ldquo;news&rdquo; (the
    translation of Scenes from a Clerical Life). If we put our
    money together to get him a present, we could give him in
    addition Adam Bede.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday, I wrote to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jones to tell them
    that I was not coming back, and unintentionally the letter
    became rather long - out of the fullness of my heart. I wished
    them to remember me and asked them <i>to wrap my recollection
    in the cloak of charity</i>.</p>

    <p>I have hung in my bedroom the two engravings Christus
    Consolator that you have given me. I saw the pictures at the
    museum, as well as Scheffer's &ldquo;Christ in
    Gethsemane,&rdquo; which is unforgettable. Then there is a
    sketch of &ldquo;Les Douleurs de la Terre&rdquo; and several
    drawings, a sketch of his studio, and, as you know, the
    portrait of his mother. There are still other fine pictures,
    for instance, Achenbach and Schelfhout and Koekkoek and also a
    fine Alleb&eacute; - an old man near the stove. Shall we look
    at them together someday?</p>

    <p>The first Sunday I was here, I heard a sermon on
    &ldquo;Behold, I make all things new.&rdquo; This morning I
    heard the Reverend Mr. Beversen in a little old church. There
    was Communion, and his text was: &ldquo;If any man thirst, let
    him come unto me, and drink.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The window in my bedroom looks out on the gardens where I
    can see pine trees, poplars, and the backs of old houses etc.,
    one of them has a gutter covered with ivy. Dickens said:
    &ldquo;A strange old plant is the ivy green.&rdquo; This view
    from my window can be solemn and gloomy, but you should see it
    in the light of the morning sun. Then when I contemplate it, I
    imagine a letter of yours in which you talked to me of houses
    covered with ivy. Do you remember it?</p>

    <p>If you can afford it - if I can, I will do the same - you
    must subscribe to the Catholic Illustration of this year; there
    are prints in it from London by Dor&eacute; - the wharves on
    the Thames, Westminster, Whitechapel, the underground railways,
    etc.</p>

    <p>A schoolmaster [G&ouml;rlitz] lives in the same house as I.
    Last Sunday, and today too, we took a fine walk together along
    the canals and outside the town along the river; we also passed
    that spot where you were waiting for the steamer.</p>

    <p>This evening when the setting sun was reflected in the water
    and in the windows and cast a bright golden glow over
    everything, it looked just like a picture by Cuyp.</p>

    <p>Write again as soon as you can. I shall have to do a lot of
    bookkeeping these days and shall be very busy.</p>

    <p>Give my kind regards to Roos, a handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
