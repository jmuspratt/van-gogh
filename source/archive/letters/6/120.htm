  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is time to write to you again. How I should have liked to
    be with you today. It is such lovely weather here and one has
    the feeling that spring is on its way. The lark can probably
    already be heard in the country, but that's unlikely to happen
    in the city, unless one can detect its call in the voice of
    some old clergyman, whose words come from a heart that's in
    tune with the lark's.</p>

    <p>Heard the Reverend Mr. Laurillard preaching this morning in
    the Oudezjide Chapel. Uncle Stricker was at church as well and
    I had coffee with him. Uncle Jan had gone to the Nieuwe Diep
    this morning but is back again now. Then to a Sunday School in
    the Barndesteeg and then walked around the outer embankments
    and, in passing, called in on three Roman Catholic
    churches.</p>

    <p>Went round to see Vos last night, who is none too well. It
    was such a sad sight to find him sitting there moodily in front
    of the window, hollow-eyed and with his feet on a stove - he is
    afflicted with cold feet. Kee too is so pale and looks so
    tired. I went on from them to Uncle Cor's. He has had the salon
    repapered and a new grey carpet laid on the floor. Now those
    beautiful bookcases with the complete Gazette des Beaux Arts,
    etc., in their red bindings, stand out better than before.
    Uncle told me that Daubigny had died. I freely confess that I
    was downcast when I heard the news, just as I was when I heard
    that Brion had died (his B&eacute;n&eacute;dicit&eacute; hangs
    in my room), because the work of such men, if it is understood,
    touches us more deeply than one realizes. <label content="attitude.death">It must be good to
    die in the knowledge that one has done some truthful work and
    to know that, as a result, one will live on in the memory of at
    least a few and leave a good example for those who come after.
    A work that is good may not last forever, but the thought
    expressed by it will, and the work itself will surely survive
    for a very long time, and those who come later can do no more
    than follow in the footsteps of such predecessors and copy
    their example.</label></p>

    <p>Speaking of good works, would you like to have a Flemish
    Imitation of Christ? I hope to send it to you shortly, in a
    small book which, if need be, can easily be slipped into the
    pocket.</p>

    <p>When Uncle told me about Daubigny, I thought of his etchings
    after Ruysdael (Le buisson and Le coup de soleil), and Uncle
    has promised to get hold of them, as he did not know them at
    all.</p>

    <p>I was at the Reverend Mr. Gagnebin's last Monday night and
    met his wife and daughter as well and also went to his study,
    where we talked until about 11 o'clock. He told me, amongst
    other things, 'That at certain times in his life it did him
    good to forget himself completely and to throw himself into his
    work without reservation, that he then achieved a great deal
    and later felt strengthened and further along the road on which
    he had set out, and enlightened in spirit. For all that, no one
    knows even how much effort his sermons cost him.'</p>

    <p>I have worked my way through the history of the Netherlands
    and have done an abstract of 30 closely written pages. (I was
    pleased to come across the battle of Waterloo and the 10-day
    campaign in it once again.) Do you know that Rochussen once
    painted the siege of Leyden? I mean the picture owned by Mr. De
    Vos. Am now also working on general history.</p>

    <p>I am looking forward more than a little to your coming here
    again. Do try your best to stay as long as possible. And if you
    can, write again soon, for you know how much pleasure your
    letters always give me.</p>

    <p>Have you read anything good lately? Be sure to get hold of
    the works of George Eliot somehow, you won't be sorry if you
    do, <i>Adam Bede,</i> <i>Silas Marner</i>, Felix Holt,
    Romola (the life of Savonarola), <i>Scenes from Clerical
    Life</i>. I shall reread them once more. Both the Reverend Mr.
    McFarlane and Adler spoke to me about them, that is, they
    advised me to read them.</p>

    <p>Wrote to Harry Gladwell this week, as he had not replied to
    my last letter and I so wanted to know what he was doing and
    what he was planning to do. I am still hoping he will become a
    clergyman, and if he does he will do a good job, of that I am
    certain. But it won't be an easy thing for him to achieve.</p>

    <p>Did you ever see an original etching by Millet of a man
    wheeling a barrow full of manure into a garden on a day like
    today, in early spring? And remember as well that he made an
    etching, `<i>Les becheurs'</i>. If you ever do come across it
    you are unlikely to forget it in a hurry. I was thinking of the
    first this morning when Uncle Stricker was looking for texts in
    which the word manure, or dung, appears, e.g., `Let it alone
    this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it'. Made a
    list recently of all the pictures by Brion I could remember.
    When you come here, you must tell me whether I have forgotten
    many of them. Lord, keep my memory green! That is something one
    should say over and over again.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday went to see Cousin Vrijdag at the timber yards.
    There are still 7 children at home, a pleasant little bunch,
    most of them very young. Could you perhaps give me notice
    somewhat in advance of your arrival? Then I can do some of my
    work beforehand so that we'll have more time to spend
    together.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, a handshake in my thoughts, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Uncle Jan sends you his regards.</p>

    <p>Remember me to everyone at your house.</p>
