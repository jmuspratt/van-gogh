  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your letter of June 7, and was glad to learn from
    it that you had been to Etten and spent Sunday there; it was
    fine that Father and little brother accompanied you back to
    Dordrecht.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">And then you tell me that you spoke with Father and Mother
    about your plans for the future; when I read that my heart went
    out to you; I think you are quite right. Launch out into the
    deep. But I only hope that you will go to London before you see
    Paris. But we must calmly wait and see how things turn out.</label> <label content="feelings.nostalgia">I
    have loved so many things in these cities; I often recall them
    with tender melancholy, and I almost wish to go back there with
    you.</label> When I occupy a small place in that large Dutch Protestant
    church, those recollections will furnish many a topic for
    sermons. Let us go on with faith and confidence, you and I. Who
    knows, we may shake hands one day, as I remember Father and
    Uncle Jan did one time in the little Zundert church when Uncle
    returned from his journey; many things had happened in both
    their lives, and they finally felt, as it were, firm ground
    under their feet.</p>

    <p>As soon as you hear any particulars, be sure to write at
    once. I hope we shall spend some quiet hours together before
    you go. Though there does not seem to be any immediate
    opportunity, such a thing can happen overnight. But I repeat,
    brother, when I think of you, my heart goes out to you. I think
    it is a very fine plan - my past comes to life again when I
    think of your future. &ldquo;Behold, I make all things
    new,&rdquo; will perhaps soon be your experience also.</p>

    <p>Blessings on you during these days. Take a last good look at
    the things around you and do not forget them, &ldquo;walk
    through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of
    it,&rdquo; as the Bible says.</p>

    <p>I am very busy every day, so time passes quickly and the
    days are almost too short, even when I stretch them very
    little. I have such a great longing to make progress, and also
    to know the Bible well and thoroughly - and also to know many
    things like what I copied for you about Cromwell. &ldquo;Not a
    day without a line&rdquo;; by writing, reading, working and
    practicing daily, perseverance will lead me to a good end.</p>

    <p>This week I visited the cemetery here outside the
    Muiderpoort; in front of it is a little wood where it is very
    beautiful, especially when the sun shines through the leaves in
    the evening. There are many beautiful graves and all kinds of
    evergreens, and roses and forget-me-nots are in bloom. I also
    walked to the Zuider Zee again; it is forty minutes from here,
    along a dyke from which one can see meadows and farms all
    around; it always reminds me of Rembrandt's etchings.</p>

    <p>Amsterdam is a beautiful city; today I again saw a little
    corner for Thijs Maris or Alleb&eacute; to paint - houses
    behind the East Church on a little square. I had to speak to
    the sexton about Uncle's seat in church, and I was in his
    house; next door there lived a cobbler, etc.; but you will find
    <i>it</i> everywhere, the world is full of it. That sexton
    reminded me of a woodcut by Rethel I think, I suppose you know
    it too - &ldquo;Der Tod als Freund.&rdquo; [Death as a Friend]
    That picture has always struck me; when I was in London one
    could see it in the show windows of almost every art shop.
    There is a sequel to it, &ldquo;The Cholera in Paris,&rdquo;
    and the &ldquo;Dance of Death&rdquo; is also by Rethel.</p>

    <p>Sunday morning I heard the Reverend Mr. Laurillard at early
    morning service; he spoke about, &ldquo;Jesus walked in the
    newly sown field.&rdquo; He made a deep impression on me. In
    that sermon he spoke also about the parable of the sower, and
    about &ldquo;the man who should cast seed into the ground and
    should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring
    up and he knows not how.&rdquo; He also mentioned the
    &ldquo;Funeral Procession through the Cornfields&rdquo; by Van
    Der Maaten. The sun was shining through the windows; the few
    people in the church were mainly working men and women. Later
    that morning I heard Uncle Stricker in the East Church on,
    &ldquo;praise not from men but from God,&rdquo; also referring
    to the death of the Queen.</p>

    <p>This morning at a quarter to five there was a terrible
    thunderstorm here; shortly after, the first gang of workmen
    came through the gates of the yard in the pouring rain. I got
    up and went out into the yard, taking a few copybooks with me
    to the summerhouse. I have been sitting there, looking out over
    the whole yard and dock; the poplars and elderberry and other
    shrubs were bowed down by the heavy storm, and the rain poured
    down on the piles of wood and on the decks of the ships. Boats
    and a little steamer were sailing back and forth, and in the
    distance, near the village across the Ij, one saw swift-moving
    brown sails and the houses and the trees on Buitenkant and the
    more vividly-coloured churches. Again and again one heard the
    thunder and saw the lightning; the sky could have been from a
    picture by Ruysdael, and the seagulls were skimming the water.
    It was a grand sight and a real relief after the oppressive
    heat of yesterday. It has quite refreshed me, for I felt very
    tired when I went upstairs last night.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I visited the Reverend Mr. Meyes and Mrs. Meyes -
    Father had asked me to - and had tea with them.</p>

    <p>When I arrived, his reverence was taking a nap and I was
    asked to come back in half an hour, and I did; fortunately, I
    had the little book by Lamennais in my pocket, and read it
    walking under the trees along the canals, where the evening sun
    was mirrored in the dark water. Then I went back, and they
    reminded me of &ldquo;Winter&rdquo; by Thorwaldsen. Father and
    Mother remind me of it even more, but I repeat that they did,
    too.</p>

    <p>The days fly by. I am four years older than you are, and
    probably they seem to go more swiftly to me than to you, but I
    fight against it by stretching them a little in the morning and
    evening.</p>

    <p>Will you write soon? It's a pity that Mager will not come
    now after all. The weather has cleared: the sky is blue and the
    sun is shining and the birds are singing - there are many of
    them in the yard, all kinds. In the evening I generally walk up
    and down there with the dog, and then I often think of that
    poem, &ldquo;Under the Stars.&rdquo; The roses against the
    house are in bloom, and in the garden, the elder bushes and the
    jessamine also.</p>

    <p>A little while ago I went again to the Trippenhuis to see if
    those rooms which were shut when we were there were open again;
    but it will be another fortnight before they are open to the
    public. There were many foreigners there, French and English;
    hearing them speak called up many memories in me. Yet I am not
    sorry to be back here. &ldquo;Life has quicksands, life has
    snares,&rdquo; is a true saying.</p>

    <p>How is Mrs. Tersteeg? If you meet Mauve or go to see him,
    give him my best regards; also at Haanebeek's and Roos's.</p>

    <p>Now I must set to work again; I have no lessons today, but
    tomorrow morning, two hours, so I have a great deal to prepare.
    I have studied through the Old Testament up to Samuel; tonight
    I begin with the Kings, and when that is finished it will be
    something worth while.</p>

    <p>Now and then when I am writing, I automatically do a small
    drawing, such as I sent you lately. I did one this morning
    representing Elijah in the desert under an orange sky, with
    some hawthorns in the foreground. It is nothing special, but I
    see it all so clearly before me, and I think that at such
    moments I could speak about it enthusiastically - may it be
    given me to do so later on.</p>

    <p>I hope you are having a good time; when you go to the woods
    at Scheveningen or to the beach, say hello to them for me. When
    you come here again, I shall be able to show you some fine
    spots here, too. When I go to Mendes's, I pass the Jewish
    quarter every day. And now &agrave; Dieu, a handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
