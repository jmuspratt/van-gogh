    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am eager to write you again - you will also let me hear
    from you soon, I hope?</p>

    <p>This morning I went to the early service, the text was
    Ephesians 5:14, &ldquo;Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from
    the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.&rdquo; It was
    raining as I left the house, and also when the service was
    over; but during the sermon the sun was shining brightly
    through the windows.</p>

    <p>Father had an early-morning service today at Etten, and
    after that he had to go to Zundert. Later on I heard good Uncle
    Stricker in the Oudezijds Chapel on the text, &ldquo;Beware of
    the leaven of the Pharisees,&rdquo; - namely, a warning against
    attaching too much importance to outward forms and ceremonies
    without true and sincere religious feeling in the heart and, on
    the other hand, life without belief in anything more than
    material things. There were very few people in church, except
    the boys and girls from the orphanage in their red and black
    clothes; they filled a great part of the little old church.</p>

    <p>When you come here again, I hope to take you there someday.
    The Oudezijds Chapel is on a very narrow street called the Old
    Teertuinen, and also the Warmoes Straat. It is a very curious
    part of town, and reminds one of the heart of London -
    Bookseller's Row, for instance.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">May it be given to me in time to preach as well as many I
    have heard in the past and hear now. I am trying my utmost to
    prepare myself for it.</label> I am very busy making a summary of the
    Reformation; the history of those days is quite stimulating and
    intriguing.</p>

    <p>Last week I spent an evening with the old Reverend Mr. Meyes
    and met his son, the Reverend Mr. Jeremie Meyes, with his wife,
    a daughter of Professor Tilanus, and two of their sons; one is
    here at the gymnasium, and the other is studying to be an
    engineer. The latter has helped to build those sheds here in
    the yard (in which they build the ships, like we saw with Uncle
    that afternoon when you were here) and also he has helped to
    build that new Kattenburg bridge. It was a pleasant evening and
    we spoke about many things abroad. He [the Reverend Mr. Jeremie
    Meyes] is a very gifted man, and has great talent and great
    faith. I heard him in the West Church. I watched him leave the
    pulpit and pass through the church after the sermon; that tall,
    noble figure, that pale, tired face and the noble head, and the
    hair already mixed with grey, made a deep impression upon me.
    It seems to me a blessing to be tired from your work in that
    way.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">Perhaps you will go to Scheveningen today. I hope you will
    have a pleasant Sunday - how I should like to be with you in
    your little room. I heard from home that you will probably soon
    visit Mauve's house in the dunes and stay there overnight. In
    my mind's eye I can see you sitting there, and also know what
    you two will be taking about.</label></p>

    <p>Mendes told me last week about a very interesting part of
    the city - namely, the outskirts extending from the Leidsche
    Poort, near the Vondel Park, to the Dutch Railway Station. It
    is full of windmills and sawmills, workmen's cottages with
    little gardens, also old houses, everything; it is very
    populous, and the quarter is cut up by many small canals and
    waterways full of boats and all kinds of picturesque bridges,
    etc. It must be splendid to be a clergyman in such a
    quarter.</p>

    <p>The study is very difficult, boy, but I must keep on.</p>

    <p>If you see Mauve and Jet one of these days, give them my
    best regards. Have a good time there and say hello to the dunes
    and the sea for me. And tell Mauve that the photograph of his
    drawing, &ldquo;The Plough in the Field,&rdquo; is hanging in
    my little room, and reminds me of him every day.</p>

    <p>Are you reading a nice book? There are so many books I
    should like to read, but I must not. If you can get John
    Halifax, read it again. Although it's depressing to read, we
    must not say, &ldquo;This is not for me,&rdquo; for it is good
    to keep your faith in everything that is good and noble. I
    heard that the man whose life and character inspired the author
    of this book died not long ago; his name was Harper, and he was
    the head of a large publishing firm in London.</p>

    <p>Once I met the painter Millais on the street in London, just
    after I had been lucky enough to see several of his paintings.
    And that noble figure reminded me of John Halifax. Millais once
    painted &ldquo;The Lost Mite,&rdquo; a young woman who early in
    the morning, at dawn, is looking for the mite she has lost
    (there is also an engraving of &ldquo;The Lost Mite&rdquo;),
    and not the least beautiful of his paintings is an autumn
    landscape, &ldquo;Chill October.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&Agrave; Dieu, boy, a firm handshake in thought and believe
    me, with kind regards to the family,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>The room in the Trippenhuis where Rembrandt's
    &ldquo;Drapers' syndicate&rdquo; is hung is open again. Coming
    from church, I went inside for a moment; right next to the
    Rembrandt hangs a portrait by Van der Helst.</p>
