  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.sisters">Well, what have you got to say about Anna? I was surprised,
    I can tell you, and it seems to be serious too - and it just
    might come off. The difficulties connected with occupying a
    subordinate position - especially if you have to persevere in
    it for a long time, as she has done for so many years in all
    honour and decency - are very great, at times becoming a severe
    struggle making what seems easy, extremely hard.</p>

    <p>Yet there is much poetry in it, and such years are a
    treasure which one does not easily lose, and if, particularly
    at first, one denies and humbles oneself, one attains a
    glorious feeling of inner peace. For all that, one could well
    understand - even if this were so - that at times the future
    may have seemed dark to her, too. As far as she is concerned,
    her decision on this step may seem sensible. Also I am inclined
    to believe she loves him sincerely. I am firmly confident of
    this, else things would not have gone so far. And therefore
    with all my heart I hope she will not be disappointed, but
    that, with God's guidance, she may have found the road toward
    enduring happiness. May the Lord grant that she might find
    rest, that dearest sister, and may He bless her, and give her
    all good things in life.</label> I congratulate you, too, on this
    occasion - likewise Anna, Father, and Mother.</p>

    <p>How are you, my dear fellow? I should have liked to write
    you sooner in answer to your last letter, but I have such a lot
    to do, and the work is not easy. Besides, I often go to church;
    there are beautiful old churches here and excellent preachers.
    I often hear Uncle Stricker; what he says is very good, and he
    preaches with much warmth and true feeling. I have heard the
    Reverend Mr. Laurillard three times; you would like him too,
    for it is as if he paints, and his work is at the same time
    high and noble art. He has the feelings of an artist in the
    true sense of the word, for instance, like Andersen, when he
    said:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Elke avond kwam de maan, en fluistrend sprak zij mij<br>

    Van wat zij in de stille, stille nacht&hellip;<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>[Translation of the whole stanza]</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Every night the moon came, whispering to me<br>

    What she had seen in the silent, silent night<br>

    From her high observatory in the heavens;<br>

    She who remembers the ages - she wandered on<br>

    High above the foam of the deluge, and shone<br>

    On the floating ark with a gentle silvery glow,<br>

    As she does now on my solitary window.<br>

    And also, when Israel with overflowing eyes<br>

    Bowed down by Babylon's streams,<br>

    With a sad lustre she cast her rays<br>

    Onto the stringless harp hanging on the willows.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>The moon is still shining, and the sun and the evening star,
    which is a good thing - and they also often speak of the Love
    of God, and make one think of the words: Lo, I am with you
    always, even unto the end of the world.</p>

    <p>&Agrave; Dieu, Theo, a warm handshake in thought, good luck
    to you, and believe me, often thinking of you,</p>

    <p>Your so loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Herewith another little contribution to your scrapbook, how
    is it progressing? Regards to the family, and to anyone who
    inquires after me.</p>
