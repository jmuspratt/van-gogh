  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today was stormy. When I went this morning to my lesson, I
    stood on the bridge looking toward the Zuider Zee. There was a
    white streak on the horizon (against which the long line of
    houses with the East Church stood out); over it hung dark grey
    clouds from which in the distance the slanting rain came
    pouring down.</p>

    <p>Yesterday Uncle Jan went to Leyden, so I was alone for the
    day; in the morning I went to the East Church, in the afternoon
    I walked toward the seaside, and I have been working the rest
    of the day. The work does not come to me so easily and quickly
    as I could wish, but practice makes perfect, I hope; only if I
    could, I should like to skip a few years, my boy. I think one
    only gets some peace after one has accomplished a few years of
    study and feels one is getting on.</p>

    <p>This morning I was in Uncle Stricker's study. It is a
    beautiful room, and a portrait of Calvin by Ary Scheffer hangs
    there; yet I should like to see more prints on the wall.</p>

    <p>Last week, I got as far as Genesis 23, where Abraham buries
    Sarah in the cave of Machpelah, the plot he had bought, and
    without really thinking about it I drew a little sketch of how
    I imagined the place; it is not worth much, but I enclose it
    herewith.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I had a good letter from home and answered it
    today; I hope you will write soon, I am looking forward to
    it.</p>

    <p>Just now the men from the wharf are going home - such an
    intriguing sight. I hear them already early in the morning; I
    think there are about 3,000 of them, and the sound of their
    footsteps is like the roaring of the sea.</p>

    <p>This morning I bought a small engraving,
    &ldquo;Tobias,&rdquo; after Rembrandt, from a Jew for 6
    cents.</p>

    <p>Uncle Jan sends you his compliments.</p>

    <p>How is Mrs. Tersteeg? I am also eager to hear if you have
    been to Mauve's.</p>

    <p>Aunt Mina is gong to Etten in a few days, which will be nice
    for Mother. Father wrote me that the church has been
    whitewashed and the organ painted. Yesterday he baptized three
    children. L&mdash; is not yet better, and W. v. Eeklen's wife
    is also very ill. Did you hear that Uncle Vincent has
    bronchitis again, and it seems to be very bad? It's lucky that
    he is not abroad, but in his own house, and that Father and
    Mother can visit him almost daily.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, be as happy as you can; my compliments to the
    Roos family, write soon, with a firm handshake,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
