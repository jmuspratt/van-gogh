    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Enclosed is a short note for A. and L.; please add a word
    and send them in time for Mother's birthday. (I must tell you
    that I am sending them to you because I'm afraid of having no
    stamps by that time, except for a letter home. If you should
    write later, these can also wait.)<br>
     Uncle Jan left for Helvoirt on Saturday and intends to stay
    away until September 10. It is very quiet here in the house
    now, but still the days go by rapidly, as I have lessons daily
    and must prepare for them. I wish the days were longer so I
    could accomplish more, for it is not always easy work, and even
    continuous plodding gives but meager satisfaction. Well, I am
    convinced that what is difficult is right, even though one sees
    no results.<br>
     I am also copying the whole of the Imitation of Christ from a
    French edition which I borrowed from Uncle Cor; the book is
    sublime, and he who wrote it must have been a man after God's
    own heart. A few days ago such an irresistible longing for that
    book came over me - perhaps because I so often look at the
    lithograph after Ruyperez - that I asked Uncle Cor to lend it
    to me; now I am copying it in the evening: it means much work,
    but I have finished most of it, and I know no better way to
    study it. I also bought Bossuet's Oraisons Funebres once more,
    for 40 cents. I feel it is necessary to work as hard as I can.
    I often think of that phrase, &ldquo;The days are full of
    evil&rdquo;; one must arm oneself and try to be filled with as
    much goodness as possible in order to be prepared and be able
    to resist. As you know, it is no small undertaking, and we do
    not know the result; but at all events I will try to fight the
    good fight.<br>
     Thomas a Kempis' book is peculiar; in it are words so profound
    and serious that one cannot read them without emotion, almost
    fear - at least if one reads with a sincere desire for light
    and truth - the language has an eloquence which wins the heart
    because it comes from the heart. You have a copy, haven't
    you?<br>
     <label content="attitude.family">There is something I cannot resist telling you, Theo - you,
    from whom I have no secrets - there is much, much that is good
    and beautiful in Uncle Jan's, Uncle Cor's and Uncle Vincent's
    lives, but still something is lacking. Don't you think that
    when the first two sit together, as often happens of an
    evening, in that lovely, restful room which you also know, it
    is a sight which warms the heart, especially if one looks at
    them with love, as I do?</label> And yet<art id=emmaus> &ldquo;The Men of
    Emmaus&rdquo; by Rembrandt</art> is even more beautiful, and it might
    have been the same. Now it is almost so, but not quite. Father
    possesses what they lack, &ldquo;It is good to be a Christian,
    to try to be one, to be one entirely, for that is Eternal
    Life.&rdquo; Now I will even go further and say, What they
    lack, their homes and families also lack. Perhaps you will
    think or speak of the man who saw the mote in his brother's eye
    and did not see the beam in his own, and then I will answer,
    That may be so, but this at least is true, &ldquo;It is good to
    be a Christian, to try to be one, to be one
    entirely.&rdquo;<br>
     A few days ago I spent an evening in the study of the Reverend
    Mr. Meyes, not the old clergyman, but the one whose appearance
    in church struck me so. It was a pleasant evening; he asked me
    a few questions about London which I could answer well, and he
    told me of his work and the blessing which apparently had
    fallen to his share. In the room hung a very good charcoal
    drawing representing a religious meeting he used to hold in his
    home on winter evenings; it was very well done - Isra&euml;ls
    would have liked it. Those who attended were workmen and their
    wives. You also find these kinds of subjects in Dor&eacute;'s
    book on London.<br>
     I also spent an evening at Stricker's, and last Sunday I heard
    Uncle preach on I Corinthians 3 : 14, &ldquo;If any man's work
    abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a
    reward.&rdquo; It often seems to me that I already feel a
    blessing and a change in my life.<br>
     How I should love to show you several things here in the
    Jewish quarter, and also in other places. I often think of De
    Groux: there are interiors with woodchoppers, carpenters,
    grocery stores, forges, chemists, etc., etc., which would have
    delighted him. This morning I saw a big dark wine cellar and
    warehouse, with the doors standing open; for a moment I had an
    awful vision in my mind's eye - you know what I mean - men with
    lights were running back and forth in the dark vault. It is
    true you can see this daily, but there are moments when the
    common everyday things make an extraordinary impression and
    have a deep significance and a different aspect. De Groux knew
    so well how to put it in his pictures and especially in his
    lithographs.<br>
     Your letter arrived just as I was writing this. Many thanks. I
    was greatly surprised to read that Gladwell was at The Hague;
    give him my best love. Oh! how I should like to see him here; I
    immediately sent him a postcard asking him to try his very best
    to come to Amsterdam - do try to persuade him also. You know
    yourself how interesting it is for a foreigner to see the city,
    the yard and this quarter, too - and how I should like to show
    him around as much as I can.<label content="feelings.nostalgia"> I long to see the brown eyes that
    could sparkle so when we looked at pictures by Michel and
    others, and talked about &ldquo;many things.&rdquo; Yes, it
    would be fine if he came and stayed as long as possible, and I
    think that we should feel that our former friendship was
    sincere and not superficial; as time goes by one does not
    always continue to feel it so strongly, &ldquo;but it is not
    dead, but it sleepeth,&rdquo; and it would be good to see each
    other again to wake and bring it to life again.</label> Enclosed is a
    little note for him; I don't think he should leave Holland
    without seeing the Trippenhuis and Van der Hoop's; try your
    best to make him come, at least if it is possible and he would
    like to.<br>
     I must sit up as long as I can keep my eyes open tonight, so I
    will close this, but if I have any time left, I will fill up
    the page later.<br>
     I hope your acquaintance with Gladwell will deepen and leave
    some good behind; it is a long time since I saw him last.<br>
     &Aacute; Dieu, a handshake in thought, have a good time, greet
    Gladwell for me, and believe me always,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
