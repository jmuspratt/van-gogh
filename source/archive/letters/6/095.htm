  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">What a fine day we spent together, one we shall not easily
    forget. I want to make sure you find a letter on your return
    from Etten. You no doubt had a good time at home too, so write
    soon and tell me how you spent the day.</label></p>

    <p>I am enclosing something for your portfolio, viz. a
    lithograph after J. Maris, which might well be called &ldquo;A
    Poor Man in the Kingdom of God,&rdquo; and a lithograph after
    Mollinger - have you ever seen it before? I have not. At a
    Jewish bookseller's, where I buy all the Latin and Greek books
    I need, I had the chance of picking prints cheaply from a large
    batch, 13 pictures for 70 cents. I thought I would take a few
    for my little room, to give it some atmosphere, which is needed
    if I am to get new ideas and freshen my mind.</p>

    <p>I will tell you what they are, so that you can have some
    idea of what it looks like now and what I have hanging up. 1
    after Jamin (which is also hanging in your room), one after M.
    Maris: that little boy going to school. 5 pictures after
    Bosboom. Van der Maaten, Funeral Procession in the Cornfields.
    Isra&euml;ls, a poor man on a snowy winter road, and Ostade,
    Studio. Then Alleb&eacute; as well, a little old woman on a
    winter morning fetching hot water and coals with the snow lying
    on the streets - I sent that one to Cor for his birthday. The
    Jewish bookseller still had a great many more excellent ones,
    but I cannot afford any more, and though I do hang up one or
    two things I am not, after all, making a collection.</p>

    <p><label subject="art.support">Yesterday Uncle Cor sent me a batch of old paper, like the
    sheet I'm using to write to you, won't it be wonderful for
    working on?</label> There's a lot of work to do already and it isn't
    easy, but with steadfastness one should get used to it. I hope
    to keep in mind the ivy &ldquo;which stealeth on though he
    wears no wings&rdquo; as the ivy creeps along the walls, so the
    pen must crawl over the paper.</p>

    <p>Every day I do some walking. Recently I went through a very
    pleasant district - when I walked down the Buitenkant to the
    Dutch railway station one could see men working there and
    alongside the Ij with sand carts - and went along all sorts of
    little narrow streets with gardens full of ivy. It had a feel
    of Ramsgate about it. At the station I turned left, where most
    of the windmills are, on to a road along a canal with elm
    trees. Everything there reminds me of Rembrandt's etchings.</p>

    <p>One of these days I shall make a start with Streckfuss's
    Algemene Geschiedenis <sup>1</sup>, or rather I have started it
    already. It isn't easy but I certainly hope that taking it one
    step at a time and doing the best one can will pay off. But it
    will take time - many testify to that, and not just Corot
    alone: &ldquo;Il n'a fallu pour cela que quarante ans de
    travail, de ens&eacute;e et d'attention.&rdquo; [It took only
    forty years work, thought and attention.] The work of men such
    as Father, the Rev. Mr. Keller van Hoorn, Uncle Stricker and so
    many others requires a great deal of study, <i>and the same is
    true of painting</i>. And a man may well ask himself: how shall
    I ever manage <i>that</i>?</p>

    <p>For one's own work, thoughts and observation are not enough,
    we need the comfort and blessing and guidance of a higher
    power, and that is something anyone who is at all serious and
    who longs to lift up his soul to the light is sure to recognize
    and experience. Pining for God works like leaven on dough. May
    it also prove to be true in the story of both our lives.</p>

    <p>Let us just believe in God and, clinging to that belief,
    confide in Him:</p>

	<blockquote><blockquote>
    God said: Set there on rock and mountain,<br>

    this in eternal writ,<br>

    Let all who there behold it<br>

    Read what it was He said:<br>

    One day hard rock will crumble<br>

    The greatest mount cave in,<br>

    Yet My covenant with you<br>

    In truth it wavers not.<br>

    (Evangelical Hymns 188: 1 - 2)<br>
	</blockquote></blockquote>
	<p></p>
	<blockquote><blockquote>
    Who but the good Lord leaves to care<br>

    And trusts in Him in direst need,<br>

    Is safe and sheltered in Him,<br>

    Is godly, marvellously spared,<br>

    Who but in God on high does trust,<br>

    Cannot have built on sand.<br>

    (Evangelical Hymn 194 :1)<br>

	</blockquote></blockquote>
    <p>Doing what needs to be done, and, if we are thrust in the
    right direction and, as it were, a door is opened for us,
    proceeding in that direction, we may acquire something of the
    old faith which God pours into many a heart, into that of the
    simple no less than into that of the great, into that of
    Aertsen no less than into that of Father or Uncle Jan or Uncle
    Cor - the same also happened to Rembrandt, Miller, Bosboom and
    who knows how many others, indeed, we can discover it in
    greater or lesser measure in almost everyone, or at least
    traces of it. He is not far away from any of us.</p>

    <p>Is Mrs. Tersteeg still keeping well and have you been round
    to see Mauve yet? Keep your spirits up, as you are no doubt
    doing, good times may be in store for us, if God spares us and
    bestows His blessing on what we do.</p>

    <p>Will you ever be joining me in some little church or other?
    God grant that you may, and I believe that He will grant it.
    Meanwhile, let us be grateful for our ordinary lives - if
    nothing out of the ordinary ever happens to us, and the only
    thing we know is a good prayer, let us then pray it, as Father
    once prayed on a New Year's Eve, when it was bitterly cold and
    the winter not easy for anybody, our own family included. That
    prayer came from the depths of his heart: &ldquo;Bind us, O
    Lord, closely to one another and let our love for Thee
    strengthen these bonds ever more, preserve us from all evil,
    above all from the evil of sin. Father, we do not pray Thee to
    deliver us from the world, but to preserve us from evil.
    Preserve us from too much self-reproach. Grant us favour in the
    eyes of those to whom we are most closely bound and in the eyes
    of those who shall come after us.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When I see a painting by Ruysdael, Van Goyen, Bosboom, or so
    many others, I am reminded again and again of the words,
    &ldquo;As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing&rdquo; - of
    <i>wee-moed</i>. [Melancholy]</p>

    <p>Will you come to my little study again some Sunday and shall
    we go together to the little church in Scheveningen again? I
    hope so.</p>

    <p>Regards to everyone at your place and accept a handshake in
    my thoughts from</p>

    <p>Your very loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Yesterday, I saw a portrait of Michelet and I studied it
    attentively, thinking of his life of ink and paper.</p>

    <p><label subject="health.fatigue">I am so tired at night that I no longer get up as early as I
    would want. But that will pass and I trust I shall be able to
    force myself to do it.</label></p>

    <p>I hope to be at Uncle Stricker's on Whit Monday afternoon
    and evening.</p>
