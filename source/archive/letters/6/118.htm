    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is Sunday night and I am going to write to you again, for
    I would so like to get another letter from you; write again
    soon, my thoughts are so often with you. I certainly hope you
    have had a pleasant Sunday.</p>

    <p>As you know, father has come to see me. That gave me a great
    pleasure. Together we went to see Mendes, to Uncle Stricker's,
    to Uncle Cor's and at the two Meyes families. The most
    agreeable part to remember of Father's visit is the morning we
    spent together in my bedroom correcting some of my work and a
    heap of other things. You can imagine how the days flew by.
    <label content="feelings.homesick">After having taken father to the station, after having watched
    the train until it disappeared and the smoke was no longer
    visible, I returned home; Father's chair was still near the
    table with the books and copybooks we had examined that day;
    and though I know that we shall see each other again pretty
    soon, I cried like a child.</label></p>

    <p>This morning I was in the English Church, and met Wierda as
    I was leaving. We walked part of the way together, and he asked
    me if I would come to see his room - he lives on the
    Weeringstraat. I went home with him and stayed for lunch, until
    about three o'clock, and saw his books and heard various things
    about his life. Then home again, and translated a page or so
    from Caesar. This afternoon I was at Uncle Stricker's;<label content="feelings.loneliness"> I go
    there rather often now that Uncle Jan is out of town and the
    house is lonely again with Father gone.</label></p>

    <p>It is foggy here today; luckily the weather was fine during
    Father's visit so that we could take many walks. Probably Uncle
    Jan will come back on Tuesday.</p>

    <p>I suppose you are very busy at the beginning of the year,
    like most people; things are becoming more and more serious for
    me as the examination draws nearer; I shall be glad when it
    gets light earlier in the morning.</p>

    <p>Has Father thought of giving you that photograph of that
    picture by Maris? The wood engraving after Van Goyen,
    &ldquo;Dordrecht,&rdquo; is hanging in its place; the other day
    I went to see the picture again at the museum - it is very,
    very fine. When you come back here I should like to look
    through the etchings by D&uuml;rer at the museum with you, the
    way we did Rembrandt's last time. Scheveningen must be
    beautiful these grey days, do you go there often? Perhaps it is
    like the picture by Ruysdael in the museum at The Hague. Have
    you got the lithograph of it which appeared in the Kunstkronyk
    long ago? It is a very good one.</p>

    <p>How is Mauve? I hope he is well; have you seen him
    lately?</p>

    <p>I have lessons from Uncle Stricker twice a week now. I
    profit a great deal from it, as Uncle is very clever, and I am
    glad he has found time for it.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, a warm handshake in thought; I must set to work,
    write soon and believe me always,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Remember me to Mauve when you see him. Good night, boy, I
    have been writing until twelve o'clock.</p>
