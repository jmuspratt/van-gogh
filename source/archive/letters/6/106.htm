  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I long to write to you again, perhaps it will be a rather
    long time before we see each other; at all events I hope we
    shall be in Etten together at Christmas. It was Aunt Mina's
    birthday last Sunday, and being there that evening, Uncle
    Stricker asked me a few things about my work, and did not seem
    to be dissatisfied&hellip;I feel that I have made some
    progress.</p>

    <p>Thursday I had a nice morning; Uncle Jan had gone to
    Utrecht, and I had to be at Stricker's at seven o'clock because
    Jan was going to Paris and I had promised to see him off. So I
    got up early and saw the workmen arrive in the yard while the
    sun was shining brightly. You would be intrigued by the sight -
    that long line of black figures, big and small, first in the
    narrow street where the sun just peeps in, and later in the
    yard. <label subject="food-and-drink.preference">Then I
    breakfasted on a piece of dry bread and a glass of
    beer</label> - <label content="feelings.suicide">that is what Dickens advises for those who are on the
    point of committing suicide, as being a good way to keep them,
    at least for some time, from their purpose. And even if one is
    not in such a mood, it is right to do it occasionally, while
    thinking, for instance, of <art id=emmaus>Rembrandt's picture, &ldquo;The Men
    of Emmaus.&rdquo;</art></label> Before I went to Stricker's, I walked through
    the Jewish quarter and along the Buitenkant, the Old
    Teertuinen, Zeedyk, Warmoes Straat, and around the Oudezijds
    Chapel and the Old and the South churches, through all kinds of
    old streets with forges and coopers' shops, etc., and through
    narrow alleys, like the Niezel, and canals with narrow bridges,
    like those we saw that evening at Dordrecht. It was interesting
    to watch the start of a new day's work there.</p>

    <p>I have written a composition in which all the parables are
    arranged in proper order, and the miracles, etc. I am doing the
    same in English and French, and expect to be able to write it
    later in Latin and Greek too. In the daytime I have to prepare
    for Mendes, and so I am doing it late in the evening, or for
    instance as today, deep in the night or early in the morning.
    After being in England and France so long, it would not be
    right if I did not acquire a thorough mastery of their
    languages at last, or at least keep them up. It is written,
    &ldquo;Polissez-le sans cesse [sic] et le repolissez&rdquo;
    [Polish it (your work) all the time, and polish it again], and
    also, &ldquo;Travaillez, prenez de la peine&rdquo; [Work, take
    pains].</p>

    <p>How are you, boy? Write soon if you can. You thought I was
    right in returning the money, didn't you? You know that I would
    have just loved to come and shake hands with you, and also to
    see the exhibition, but for the present I do not go out of town
    on Sundays, I must not.</p>

    <p>This morning I had a talk with Mendes about M. Maris, and
    showed him that lithograph of those three children, and also
    &ldquo;A Baptism,&rdquo; and he understood them very well.
    Mendes reminds me now and then of the &ldquo;Imitation of Jesus
    Christ,&rdquo; by Ruyperez.</p>

    <p>Have you heard anything about Carolien? I had to go to
    Utrecht on the day of Hendrik's<sup>1</sup> wedding reception;
    I congratulated them for you, too. It was a very stylish
    affair; the room was very beautifully decorated, and the bride
    looked lovely.</p>

    <p>In Utrecht I saw the Cathedral and another old church, and
    the university building, which reminds one of the cloisters
    near Westminster Abbey. Goodbye, Theo, have a good time, my
    compliments to the Roos family. Uncle Jan sends you his
    regards, &agrave; Dieu, a handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
