  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">Thanks for your letter of February 17; it made me very
    happy, as I had been looking forward to it so much. And I am
    answering it at once, boy, for I think of you and long for you
    so often, and every morning the prints on the wall of my little
    study remind me of you - &ldquo;Christus Consolator&rdquo;; the
    woodcut after Van Goyen, &ldquo;Dordrecht&rdquo;; &ldquo;Le
    Four&rdquo; by Rousseau, etc. - for I received them all from
    you.</label> So the pot was calling the kettle black when you wrote me
    that I ought not to send you a print for your room sometimes
    when I find one that I think you will like. In my turn I say,
    Enough of that; but tell me if you have got some new
    acquisitions for your collection lately.</p>

    <p>Last evening at Uncle Cor's I saw a whole volume of that
    magazine, L'Art; you have the issue with the wood engravings
    after Corot. I was especially struck by wood engravings after
    drawings by Millet, including &ldquo;Falling Leaves,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;The Ravens' Wedding,&rdquo; &ldquo;Donkeys in a
    Marsh,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Woodcutters,&rdquo; &ldquo;Housewife
    Sweeping Her Room,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Farm Courtyard&rdquo; (night
    effect), etc. Also by an etching after Corot, &ldquo;The
    Dune&rdquo;; and &ldquo;St. John's Eve&rdquo; after Breton; and
    others by Chauvin; and another after Millet, &ldquo;The
    Beans.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Last Sunday Uncle Jan and I spent the whole afternoon and
    evening at Uncle Cor's. It was a very pleasant day for me. I
    got up very early and went to the French church in the morning.
    A clergyman from the neighborhood of Lyons preached here - he
    had come to collect money for an evangelical mission. His
    sermon was mainly stories from the lives of the working people
    in the factories, and though he was not particularly eloquent
    and one could even hear that he spoke with some difficulty and
    effort, his words were still effective because they came from
    the heart - only such are powerful enough to touch other
    hearts.</p>

    <p>At one o'clock I had to be at the Sunday school of an
    English clergyman, Adler, in the Barndesteeg; he has a small
    but very neat old church there. However, the school was held
    in a little room where even at that hour, in the middle of the
    day, the gaslight had to be turned on. There were perhaps
    twenty children from that poor section. Though he is a
    foreigner, he preaches in Dutch (but the service is in
    English); he teaches his Bible class in Dutch too, and does it
    very well. I had brought with me a sketch of the map of the
    Holy Land which I made for Father's birthday, in red crayon and
    on strong brown paper, and I gave it to him; I thought that
    little room would be a nice place for it, and I am glad it
    hangs on the wall there now. I had met him at Mr. McFarlane's,
    the incumbent of the English church in the Beguinage whom I had
    ventured to call on; he received me kindly and I hope to repeat
    my visit someday.</p>

    <p>Besides this English clergyman, I also ventured to call on
    the Reverend Mr. Gagnebin. He took it in good part, and told me
    to come again some evening; as he suggested tonight, I must go
    there in a little while. I hope to write you all about it.
    Father has also advised me to try and make some acquaintances.
    I was so glad to speak French and English again - it is a
    peculiar sensation when one hasn't for a long time.</p>

    <p>The last two mornings I got up very early to work on a
    sketch of the map of Paul's travels which I had begun and have
    now finished; it looks well now (with the names in French),
    even better than those I made for Father and for my own room. I
    plan to give it to the Reverend Mr. Gagnebin, as I want to
    emphasize that visit if possible: he is a learned man who can
    perhaps give me some good advice later on if he realizes that
    my intentions are serious&hellip;.</p>

    <p>I have just been to Gagnebin's, but I was told that he was
    too busy to receive me (yet he had fixed this hour and this day
    for my visit). I heard music in the house, so probably there
    was something going on. I left what I had made for Gagnebin
    with the servant, requesting that it be given to him.<label content="feelings.ambition"> I want to
    do such things now and then, for it certainly is very doubtful
    that I shall ever succeed, I mean, shall ever pass all the
    examinations. Five years at the least is a very long time; if
    one begins earlier, it is so much easier. It is true I can work
    longer and concentrate better, and things that many others care
    about have no attraction for me; but, after all, the work costs
    me great effort. Even if I fail, I want to leave my mark here
    and there behind me.</label></p>

    <p>There are so many, many things one has to know, and though
    they try to reassure me, it constantly gives me a terribly
    anxious feeling. There is no remedy but to set to work again,
    since it is clearly my <i>duty</i> to do this, whatever it
    costs. So I must push on, for standing still or going back is
    out of the question: it would make things even more difficult
    and cause confusion - and the end would mean the necessity of
    beginning all over again.</p>

    <p>I had a nice letter from home; the journey seems not to have
    done Father any harm. It is pretty late, and I am not a little
    tired, for I have walked quite a distance today. Have a good
    time, and blessings on your work and on all you undertake;
    write soon if you can. My regards to all at the Rooses', and a
    warm handshake in thought. Good night and sleep well, believe
    me,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Tuesday morning. It is beautiful weather this morning, I
    have to go to Mendes's in a few minutes.</p>
