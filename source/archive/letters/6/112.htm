  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your last letter, which I enjoyed very much. Yes,
    boy, that etching after Jules Goupil is splendid, and with all
    that is linked to it, it makes a good and beautiful whole,
    which is a good thing to treasure in one's heart. I almost envy
    your having read Carlyle's French Revolution; I have read a
    little of it, but not all - I found fragments of it in a book
    by Taine.</p>

    <p>I am busy making an excerpt from Motley, including
    &ldquo;The Conquest of Den Briel,&rdquo; and the siege of
    Haarlem, Alkmaar and Leyden; I also drew a map of it, thus
    making a whole of the two.</p>

    <p>I keep my work together, to help me to pass the
    examinations; I consult Mendes in everything and arrange my
    studies according to what he has done, for I should like to do
    it in the same way. The history of the Eighty Years' War is
    magnificent! Whoever should make such a good fight in his life,
    would do well. In truth, life is a battle, it is necessary to
    defend and protect ourselves, and we must plan and calculate
    with a cheerful and brave spirit in order to make progress.</p>

    <p>As we get older, it becomes more and more difficult, and it
    may rightly be said:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Does the road go uphill all the way?<br>

    &ldquo;Yes, to the very end.&rdquo;<br>

    And will the journey take all day long?<br>

    &ldquo;Yes, from morn till night, my friend.&rdquo;<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>But the inmost strength of the heart is developed by
    fighting the difficulties. On grandit dans la temp&ecirc;te
    [one grows in the storm], if only we always strive after
    keeping the heart - out of which all that goes forth into life
    is good and simple and rich - in God, so that we may have a
    clear conscience before God and man.</p>

    <p>Even as we look at others, so we in turn are watched by the
    many eyes belonging to that conscience - God's greatest gift
    and the proof that His eye is upon us, but is the shade of our
    right hand, and when He delivers us from evil, then that light
    enters the darkness of life and of the world. And if we feel,
    as it were, that there is an eye looking down upon us, it would
    be well for us to lift up our eyes at times, as if to see the
    Invisible.</p>

    <p>I know the history of Frederick the Great, illustrated by
    Menzel; it is a good acquisition. Go on with your collection; I
    also know that wood engraving after Jacque, &ldquo;The
    Sheepfold.&rdquo; Don't forget to bring these things with you
    when you come home for Christmas.</p>

    <p>I bought from a Jew a lithograph after L. Steffens; you once
    showed me the picture - an old and a young clergyman talking
    together in a garden - it is a good lithograph. The scene
    reminded me of a picture by Jacquand - I think it is called
    &ldquo;The New Vicar&rdquo; - it has the same sentiment; it
    also reminded me of &ldquo;The Novice&rdquo; by G.
    Dor&eacute;.</p>

    <p>Old son, the study of Latin and Greek is arduous;
    nevertheless, it still makes me happy, I have finally dived
    into studies of which I have always dreamt. I cannot sit up so
    late in the night any more - Uncle has strictly forbidden it.
    Still, the legend under the etching by Rembrandt continues to
    haunt me: &ldquo;In medio noctis vim suam lux exterit&rdquo;
    [the light shines better in the middle the night]. All night, I
    leave the gas light on low, and often it comes to me to
    contemplate this poor light in medio noctis, while planning my
    work for the next day and thinking of the best means to
    study.</p>

    <p>I hope to light the fire early in the morning this winter,
    the winter mornings have something peculiar about them,
    Fr&egrave;re painted it in his picture of the workman,
    &ldquo;Un Tonnelier&rdquo; [a cooper]; the etching is hanging
    in your room, I think.</p>

    <p>Remplis mon &acirc;me d'une sainte amertume qui te soit
    agr&eacute;able, et je passerai humblement toutes les
    ann&eacute;es de ma vie dans ton service, dans l'amertume de
    mon &acirc;me [fill my soul with a holy bitterness as it may
    please Thee, and I shall spend all the years of my life in Thy
    service, in the bitterness of my soul; immediately after this,
    written in English], &ldquo;yea, even in Thy service, O man of
    sorrows and acquainted with grief.&rdquo; This certainly is a
    good prayer, and I thought of it when in simplicity I said to
    you that it is a good thing in this world to soak oneself in
    coffee. Man is full of needs, and requires strength and
    reinvigorating in order to be able to work. What cannot be
    cured must be endured, and one must use the weapons within
    one's reach and the means at one's disposal to make the most of
    one's powers and gain advantage. (You see by the handwriting
    that it was getting dark; now the lamp is burning.)</p>

    <p>One afternoon at Uncle Stricker's, I ate hotchpotch, and on
    this occasion it occurred to me to make an excerpt from Motley;
    I'll show it to you at Christmas. Because I have such a
    frightful number of stone thresholds and church floors and
    stone stoops of houses under my eyes and feet, I hit on the
    idea of making those maps of rocky Scotland and colouring them
    (red and green). <label subject="food-and-drink.preference">I thought
    of those pickles which Uncle is so
    fond of and which I have learned to like too.</label> The soul of man
    is singularly strange, and I think it is excellent to have one
    - like a map of England, made with loving devotion - and to
    have in it as much as possible of the love which is holy in all
    things and believes in all things and hopes all things and
    suffers all things, and never perishes. This love is the light
    of the world, the true life which is the light of man. Surely
    knowledge of languages is a precious possession, and I am
    anxious to grasp something of it too.</p>

    <p>When one eats a crust of black rye bread, it is well to
    think of the words, &ldquo;Tunc justi fulgebunt ut sol in
    regnum Patris sui&rdquo; [then the righteous shall shine like
    the sun in the kingdom of their Father], or, too, when one
    often has muddy boots or wet black clothes. May all of us
    someday enter the kingdom which is not of this world, where
    they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, where the sun
    shall no longer be the light of day, and the moon shall no
    longer shine to be a brightness, but where the Lord will be a
    light eternal, and God our glory, where the sun shall no more
    go down; and the light of the moon shall not wane, for the Lord
    shall be there as an eternal light, and the days of thy
    mourning shall be ended, and God shall wipe away all tears [see
    Is. 60:19-20]. And thus we can be leavened with the leaven of
    &ldquo;sorrowful yet always rejoicing,&rdquo; being what we are
    by the Grace of God, and carrying in the secrecy of our hearts
    the words, &ldquo;I never despair,&rdquo; because we have faith
    in God. And then &ldquo;set your face as a flint&rdquo; is a
    good precept in many circumstances, and also &ldquo;as a pillar
    of iron or as an old oak tree.&rdquo; It is a good thing to be
    fond of thorns, like the thorn hedges around English country
    churches, or of the roses in a churchyard - they are so
    beautiful these days - yea, if we could make ourselves a crown
    of the thorns of life, wearing it before men and so that God
    may see us wearing it, we should do well.</p>

    <p>Maybe you know the wood engravings by Swain; he is a very
    clever man, his studio is in such a pleasant part of London,
    not far from that part of the Strand where the offices of the
    illustrated papers (The London News, Graphic, etc.) are, nor
    from Bookseller's Row, which is full of all kinds of bookstores
    and shops where one sees everything - from etchings by
    Rembrandt to the Household Edition of Dickens and the Chandos
    Classics. Everything there has a greenish tone, especially
    during foggy weather in autumn or the dark days before
    Christmas; it reminds one of Ephesus as it is described so
    remarkably and simply in the Acts. (The bookshops in Paris are
    very interesting, too, including those in the Faubourg St.
    Germain.)</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">Oh, boy, I shall be too glad for words if I can pass my
    examination; if I can overcome the difficulties, it will be in
    all simplicity of heart but also in prayer to God, for I often
    pray fervently to Him for the wisdom I need. And then that He
    may once grant that I write and preach many sermons - the more,
    the better - resembling our father's, and finish a work in my
    life, with every day bringing some improvement.</label></p>

    <p>I spent Monday evening at Uncle Cor's, and saw Aunt and the
    whole family; all send you their kindest regards. Uncle showed
    me that book, L'Oeuvre Grav&eacute; de Ch. Aubigny.</p>

    <p>From there I went to Uncle Stricker's and had a long talk
    with him and Aunt, for Mendes had been to see them a few days
    ago (one must not talk too lightly about genius, even though
    one believes there is more of it in the world than many
    suppose, but Mendes certainly is a very remarkable person, and
    I am and will remain grateful for my contact with him). I am
    glad to say he did not make an unfavourable report about me,
    but Uncle asked me if I did not find it very difficult, and I
    acknowledged that I did indeed, and that I tried my best, in
    every possible way, to remain strong and keep myself alert in
    all possible ways. He told me not to lose heart.</p>

    <p>But now that terrible algebra and mathematics still remain;
    well we must see - after Christmas I must have lessons in those
    also, it is necessary. Besides, I cling to the church for aid
    and to the bookshops; I invent some errand to go there whenever
    possible. Today I was at Schalekamp's and at Brinkman's in the
    Hartestraat (that shop of Schalekamp's is very interesting),
    and I bought a few Teacher's Society maps - there are about a
    hundred of them at a penny apiece, including the Netherlands in
    every different historical period. So often, in the past too, a
    visit to a bookshop has cheered me and reminded me that there
    are good things in the world.</p>

    <p>The picture by Isra&euml;ls which you describe must have
    been very beautiful; I can imagine it well from your vivid
    description. I saw a small picture by him at Uncle Cor's, also
    a very fine one by Mauve - a shepherd with a flock of sheep
    crossing the dunes.</p>

    <p>I had a nice, cheerful letter from home; I was glad to hear
    that things are somewhat better at Prinsenhage. How I look
    forward to Christmas; bring as many things as you can with you,
    it will be good for us all. Take your time about sending the
    tobacco, <i>I have some left</i>; it is a good and necessary
    help in studying.</p>

    <p>I wrote a long letter to Harry Gladwell, who left today; I
    sent your regards, too.</p>

    <p>When you have a chance, don't forget Michelet, you know, and
    J. Breton; but you know what it's for, and that there is no
    hurry and Christmas will be soon enough. Now I must set to
    work, this sheet is almost covered. Have a good time, and write
    me soon. Uncle sends you his greetings, also Uncle and Aunt
    Stricker. Give my compliments to the Roos family, also to Mauve
    and his wife and to Tersteeg and Van Stockum - how is
    Carolien?</p>

    <p>A blessing on all you undertake, keep courage and good cheer
    during these autumn days, and may Christmas come soon and you
    and I be together again before we know it. &Agrave; Dieu, a
    handshake in thought and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Saw two photographs of pictures by Gabriel von Max, the
    raising of Jairus's daughter and a nun in a convent garden; the
    former was particularly fine.</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin] I also have an abridged edition of
    Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, and am working all day, every day,
    so I shall get something done, too.</p>

    <p>Do you know an engraving after Landseer, &ldquo;The
    Highlander&rdquo; it is called, I think - a highlander in a
    snowstorm at the top of a mountain, with an eagle he has shot
    in his hand?</p>
