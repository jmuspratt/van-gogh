  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">I am eager to write you again, because I often think of you
    and I wish it were Christmas, when we shall see each other
    again.</label></p>

    <p>Here, the dark days before Christmas are as a long
    procession at the end of which shines such a light, the feast
    of the Nativity: the friendly lighthouse behind the rocks, when
    the water comes crashing against them on a dark night. This
    feast of Christmas has always been for us a bright spot, and
    may it always remain so.</p>

    <p>For the first time there has been an entrance examination at
    the university, I, too, shall have to take it here in this
    city. Besides the ordinary subjects, Latin, Greek, algebra and
    mathematics, one has to pass examinations on history, geography
    and Dutch grammar.</p>

    <p>I have been looking for an algebra and mathematics teacher;
    I have found one, the cousin of Mendes, Teixeira de Mattos, who
    teaches religion at the Jewish pauper school. He has given me
    hope to cover all the programs before the month of October of
    next year.</p>

    <p>If I should pass the examination, I will be able to
    congratulate myself, because they told me at the start of my
    studies that a minimum of two years would be necessary for me
    to deepen my knowledge of these four subjects. If I succeed in
    October, I will have made up in a lot less time. <label content="feelings.ambition">May God grant
    me the necessary wisdom and grant my wishes, that He will allow
    me to end my studies as early as possible in order that I
    become ordained, so that I can perform the duties of a
    clergyman.</label></p>

    <p>The preparatory studies, which precede theological studies
    proper, which will be exercises in preaching and recitation,
    consist of history, Dutch grammar, the geography of Greece,
    Asia Minor and Italy. I apply myself to these studies with the
    tenacity of a dog that gnaws a bone; I should also like to know
    the grammar, history and geography of the Nordic countries,
    particularly those countries that border on the North Sea and
    the Channel.</p>

    <p>At last I succeeded in making a map of Asia Minor, Greece
    and Italy, rather a large one (on which the travels of Paul are
    also indicated) and one of England which finally has the
    quality I wanted - Mendes, for one, sees it - namely that it
    has been made with feeling and love. The names I put on it came
    from a map in the Atlas Antiquus by Spr&uuml;ner Menke, which
    Mendes has; it is one used for history. Do try your best to get
    a look at that atlas, and also at the one by Stieler
    especially, for it is the work of <i>real</i> artists.</p>

    <p>I spent two evenings at Uncle Cor's looking over old books,
    including volumes of L'Illustration, in which I found many old
    friends (what an interesting magazine it is!). Among others,
    there was an old portrait of Dickens and a woodcut by De Lemud,
    &ldquo; Cup of Coffee&rdquo; - a young man with rather severe,
    sharp features and a serious expression who looks just as if he
    were pondering over a fragment from <i>l'imitation de la vie
    monastique</i> or planning some difficult but good work, as
    only une &acirc;me en peine can do. Such work is not always the
    worst, for what is wrought in sorrow, lives for all time.
    &ldquo;Heureux celui que la v&eacute;rit&eacute; instruit, non
    par des mots fugitifs, mais par elle m&ecirc;me en se montrant
    telle qu'elle est&rdquo; [Happy the one who is taught by truth,
    not by fleeting words but by itself, showing itself as it is]
    is a good saying.</p>

    <p>I was also at Uncle Cor's on Aunt's birthday last Friday.
    They played cards that evening, and as I cannot play, I read in
    Aug. Gruson, Histoire des Croisades (Pantheon Classique 50
    cmes.). It is a fine little book, I should almost say written
    with the sentiment of Thijs Maris - for instance, when he
    paints an old castle on a rock with the autumn woods in
    twilight, and the black fields in the foreground, with a
    peasant and a white horse ploughing. It also reminded me of
    Michelet and Carlyle.</p>

    <p>I should like very much to have Father know that etching,
    &ldquo;A Young Citizen of the Year V.&rdquo; Shall we send it
    on or before Father's birthday, with some other small
    photographs on the subject of the Revolution, so that they form
    a whole and Father can see what occupies our thoughts so
    often?</p>

    <p>You have heard, I suppose, that sad news arrived from
    Brussels today and that Father has gone there already. Uncle
    Jan, who received a telegram from Mother with this information,
    wired Father and received the answer, &ldquo;<i>Condition
    unchanged, do not come yet, I am here</i>.&rdquo; Uncle Jan and
    Uncle Cor were ready to start for Brussels together, but now
    they are waiting for more news from Father. Will that long and
    terrible suffering come to an end at last?</p>

    <p>Goodbye, Theo, write soon, boy, if you can. May God keep us
    in health and give us the lucidity, strength and cheerfulness
    which we need every day. A warm handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>The news about Uncle Hein came while I was writing this.</p>
