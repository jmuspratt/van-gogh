  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for yesterday's letter; it was a good one - there was
    so much in it, it was quite refreshing to me.</p>

    <p>I found a few stamps enclosed, for which many thanks, and
    then you say you will send a money order so that I can come to
    The Hague to see the exhibition of drawings. The money order
    arrived today, Sunday; many thanks for it and for your kind
    offer, but I am sending it back and will not come, much as I
    should like to see the beautiful and interesting things which
    you write about.</p>

    <p>I have already refused to go to Baarn, first, because I'd
    rather spend my Sunday in going to church a few times, in
    writing, and in studying a little; second, because I should
    have to ask Uncle Stricker for the money for the journey. He
    has money from Father which is at my disposal in case of need,
    but I hope to use it as little as possible. If I go to The
    Hague, I must also go to Baarn, and then once is not enough -
    quoi qu'il en soit - I had rather not. Besides, boy, I know you
    need the money yourself. But many, many thanks, you know.</p>

    <p>I do not regret in any way not always having money in my
    pocket. I do have a craving for thousands of things that, if I
    had money, I would spend it perhaps on books or other things
    which I can very well pass by and which would distract me
    perhaps from my studies. Even in my current situation it is not
    always easy to resist distractions; if I had books in reach of
    my hand it would only make it worse. I understand that, the
    same as the pauper and needy of the world, one can be enriched
    in God and that this treasure, nothing can take it from you.
    Perhaps, one day, we will have leisure for all books: we would
    then have regretted spending our youth only in our personal
    satisfaction - particularly if we had a hearth and a family
    which would be necessary for us to take care of and to
    preoccupy us.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">In the midst of life we are near death, that is a phrase
    which touches each one of us personally, it is a truth we see
    again confirmed in what you tell me about Carolien van Stockum,
    and formerly we saw it in another member of the same family. It
    has touched me, and with all my heart I hope she may recover.
    Oh! what sorrow, what sadness and suffering there is in the
    world, in public as well as in private life. How everything is
    changed in that house, compared to what it was a few years ago,
    &ldquo;das war vor langen Jahren, wenn [sic] wir beisammen
    waren&rdquo; [that was many years ago, when we were together];
    that was the time of Der Wirthin T&ouml;chterlein.</label> Longfellow
    says, &ldquo;There are thoughts that make the strong heart
    weak,&rdquo; but above all it is written, &ldquo;Let him who
    puts his hand to the plough not look back, and be a man.&rdquo;
    I often look at that engraving after the picture by Ruysdael,
    &ldquo;Haarlem and Overveen&rdquo;; that painter knew, too.</p>

    <p>If she should soon recover enough to be moved to The Hague,
    and if you see her then, remember me to her. If you can find
    words which will cheer her or give her courage, remind her of
    how much she is needed in this world and of the right and
    reason she has to live, especially for her children's sake, say
    them; you will be doing a good deed. Spoken in time, forceful
    words from the heart can cheer and comfort.</p>

    <p>This morning I was up rather early and left the house about
    six o'clock to go to early morning service. Then I walked
    through all kinds of old streets where I wished you were with
    me; you know the picture (at least the lithograph and wood
    engraving after it) by Daubigny, &ldquo;Le Pont Marie&rdquo; -
    it reminded me of that. I like to walk on old, narrow, and more
    or less gloomy streets, with drugstores, lithographic and other
    printing offices, sea-chart shops and stores with ship's
    victuals, etc., which one finds there near the Oudezijds Chapel
    and the Teertuinen and at the end of the Warmoes Straat;
    everything is interesting there. I just stepped in to say good
    morning to Vos and Kee, and then went on to the Island Church,
    where the Reverend Mr. ten Kate, the poet of &ldquo;The
    Creation&rdquo; and author of many beautiful books, preached on
    Romans 1:15-17. The church was very crowded, and one saw an
    expression of <i>faith</i> written on many faces, men's as well
    as women's, but written in different characters. Sometimes his
    intonation and expression were like Father's. He spoke very
    well and from a full heart, and though the sermon was not
    short, the service was over almost before one knew it, for his
    words were so interesting that one forgot the time.</p>

    <p>For a change last week I made an excerpt from the journeys
    of Paul and drew a map of them; it is a good thing to have.</p>

    <p>The other day Uncle Stricker gave me a book on the geography
    of Palestine (in German, by Raumer) of which he had a duplicate
    copy.</p>

    <p>The following is a fine fragment from
    T&eacute;l&eacute;maque. Mentor says:</p>

    <p>The earth is never ungrateful, she always bestows her fruit
    on those who cultivate her with care and with love; she refuses
    her wealth only to those who fear to labour for her. The more
    children the peasants have, the richer they are - if their
    lords do not tax them too heavily - for from their earliest
    childhood the children begin to assist them. The youngest tend
    the sheep in the meadows; those who are a little older have
    large herds entrusted to their care; the oldest work with their
    father. Meanwhile the mother prepares a simple meal for her
    husband and her dear children, who will come home tired from
    the day's toil. She milks the cows and the goats, and streams
    of milk are flowing; she makes a big fire, around which the
    whole innocent, happy family sits singing of an evening, until
    the time comes for peaceful repose.</p>

    <p>It is more beautiful still when one thinks of it illustrated
    with etchings by Jacque.</p>

    <p>Your postcard arrived just now, thanks for the quick news. I
    hope you had a good Sunday. Cousin Fanny and Betty and Bertha
    are still here and are like flowers in the house. Bertha
    especially is a nice little girl. My compliments to the Rooses
    and a handshake in thought from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>I cannot get a money order, so I must send back the amount
    in stamps.</p>
