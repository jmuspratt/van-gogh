    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It will soon be Mother's birthday, therefore I am enclosing
    a money order for 1.25 guilders; I should like it if you and I
    could give her something together. It is not much, but it is
    all I have; if you contribute the same amount we can buy a good
    photograph. You must choose one yourself; &ldquo;Christ Walking
    on the Sea&rdquo; by Jalabert is more expensive, otherwise I
    should have liked that; and<art id=emmaus> &ldquo;The Men of Emmaus&rdquo; by
    Rembrandt</art> is considerably more expensive. Well, you know what
    to get as well as I do and will make a good choice, but just
    write a postcard with the title of what you have chosen. Thanks
    for your letter, which made me happy, as did a cheerful letter
    from home I received yesterday.</p>

    <p>Yesterday was a rainy morning, so I had to put on my
    overcoat to go to early service in the North Church. The
    Reverend Mr. Posthumus Meyes, Jr., preached there on Acts 4:11,
    &ldquo;This is the stone which was set at nought of you
    builders, which is become the head of the corner.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>His son came here yesterday and spent some time in my little
    study; he came to invite me to spend this evening with them,
    which I readily accepted. Last week I visited the old
    clergyman, his father. Yesterday morning I was also in the
    Island Church, where Uncle Stricker preached on Luke 11:28. The
    afternoon and part of the evening I spent at Uncle Stricker's,
    so I had a pleasant Sunday; I often thought of what you would
    be doing.</p>

    <p>Will you be going on a business trip this autumn, and will
    you come to Amsterdam then? I certainly hope so; write as soon
    as you know anything about it. And we must arrange things so
    that you come and stay here; there is room enough at the house,
    and it will cost us only one word to Uncle. We must make the
    most of our chance to be together. I still have a great deal of
    work to do today, are you very busy at the office?</p>

    <p>Last week a ship was launched in the yard (a monitor The
    Dragon); it was an interesting sight and a joyous occasion for
    the workmen. Bicker's Island also has many shipyards, but for
    smaller vessels. When I go there, I look at them carefully; he
    who must learn to work must watch the workers, especially if he
    has a little study right among the workshops; for just as large
    and small ships are under construction in a shipyard, gradually
    finished and then launched, so in a study, large and small
    works are planned, carried on by &ldquo;patient continuance in
    well doing,&rdquo; and finished with God's help.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">I am longing so much to see you again, boy; come soon and
    try to arrange for us to spend some time together.</label> Would it be
    possible for you to stay here over a Sunday? I should like so
    much to show you the Oudezijds Chapel and have you hear someone
    preach there, Uncle Stricker, for instance. Do try to arrange
    it.</p>

    <p>I do not know the book by Daudet you mentioned. Well, I must
    write my Greek exercises; my regards to the Rooses and to Mauve
    and Jet when you go there. &Agrave; Dieu, brother dear, a warm
    handshake in thought, I wish I could have sent you more for
    Mother's birthday, but it is impossible. Have a good time,
    believe me always,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Uncle Jan intends to go to Helvoirt on the first of
    September for a week; I hope to take advantage of it by staying
    up late in the sitting room to write. I can do it now, but
    Uncle's bedroom is quite near, so I have to be careful; I can
    sit in my bedroom, but there the temptation to go to bed when
    it is getting late is too strong, and there is no gas in my
    little study.</p>
