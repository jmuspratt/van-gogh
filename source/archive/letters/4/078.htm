    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>How grateful I was for your little note, and for Mother's
    letter; so we shall wait until Christmas and may God give us a
    happy meeting then. &ldquo;My illness is no misfortune.&rdquo;
    No, for &ldquo;sorrow is better than laughter.&rdquo; No, when
    God supports us, illness is no misfortune, especially when we
    get new ideas and new intentions in those days of illness that
    would not have come to us if we had not been ill, and when in
    those days we achieve clearer faith and stronger trust in
    God.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Man's extremity is God's opportunity.&rdquo; In our
    weakness we are strong. Illness sanctifies health and teaches
    us to keep well. But do get well soon, my boy. Oh! how I long
    for Christmas.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I was in Mr. Jones's church <sup>1</sup> to help
    with the preparations for tonight. A clergyman from Leicester
    will then lecture on the Reformation and illustrate it by magic
    lantern with slides of that period. I have already seen some of
    the pictures, they are in the style of Holbein - you know that
    many painters and graphic artists here work in that style.
    There was a very beautiful picture of Luther's marriage.</p>

    <p>Last Monday there was a &ldquo;tea meeting&rdquo; in that
    church; it was the anniversary of its opening. More than two
    hundred and fifty people were at tea, and afterward Mr. Jones
    and a few other clergymen spoke until late in the evening.</p>

    <p>It has been very beautiful here lately, especially the
    streets in the evening when it is more or less hazy and the
    lamps are lit, and also in the park which I wrote you about. A
    few days ago I saw the sun setting there behind the elm trees
    with their bronze-coloured leaves. Over the grass was that haze
    which Anna wrote about, and the brook which the swans swim in
    runs through the park. The acacia trees in the playground have
    almost lost their leaves; I see them through the window in
    front of my desk - sometimes they stand out dark against the
    sky, sometimes I see the sun rise red in the mist behind them.
    It will soon be winter now; I am so glad Christmas comes in
    winter - that's why I like winter best of all the seasons.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">How delightful it will be to sail down the Thames and across
    the sea, and see those friendly Dutch dunes and the church
    spire that is visible from so very far away.</p>

    <p>How little we see of each other and how little we see of our
    parents, and yet the family feeling and our love for each other
    is so strong that the heart is uplifted and the eye turns to
    God and prays, &ldquo;Do not let me stray too far from them,
    not too long, O Lord.&rdquo;</label></p>

    <p>No, when God supports us, illness is no misfortune,
    especially when we get new ideas and new intentions in those
    days of illness that would not have come to us if we had not
    been ill, and when we achieve clearer faith and stronger trust
    in God.</p>

    <p>&Agrave; Dieu, boy, my very best wishes; regards to Roos,
    and to other acquaintances if you see them and believe me with
    a handshake,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
