    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for the letter I received this morning. There are
    hours and days and periods in life when God hides His
    countenance, as it were; but for those who love God those
    times, those sad times, are not wholly devoid of God, but as if
    they were full of prophecies for the future and full of voices
    from the past, &ldquo;so far the Lord has led you,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;cherish the old faith again.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If things you had not expected should happen to you,
    strengthen in yourself the sorrowing for God, and the voice,
    &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It was an autumn day when I stood on the steps before Mr.
    Provily's school, watching the carriage in which Pa and Mother
    were driving home. One could see the little yellow carriage far
    down the road - wet with rain and with spare trees on either
    side - running through the meadows.</p>

    <p>The grey sky above it all was mirrored in the pools.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">And about a fortnight later I was standing in the corner of
    the playground when someone came and told me that a man was
    there, asking for me; I knew who it was, and a moment later I
    fell on Father's neck.</label> What I felt then, could not it have been
    &ldquo;because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of
    his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father&rdquo;? It was a
    moment in which we both felt we had a Father in heaven; for
    Father too looked upward, and in his heart there was a greater
    voice than mine, crying, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>(Try to send me the page from Michelet.)</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin] Do you ever go to Communion? They
    that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.</p>

    <p>Between that moment and the present there lie years of
    exile. - There is a phrase that accompanies us, and seems to
    grow up with us - sorrowful yet always rejoicing. There is the
    prayer for a mother for her children, a prayer which is very
    powerful, for the prayer of the righteous has great power:</p>

    <p>Father, I pray unto Thee not that thou shouldest take them
    out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the
    evil.</p>

    <p>There is the faithful hand of the father which blessed us
    when we left the parental home.</p>

    <p>And then, boy, as I told you before, there is a strong
    craving for the day when He will no longer remember the sins of
    my youth. Who rejoices in grey hairs? As far as the east is
    from the west, so far I shall remove your transgressions from
    you [Ps. 103:12]. &ldquo;Though your sins be as scarlet, they
    shall be as white as snow.&rdquo; Whoever doth not hate his own
    life cannot be a disciple of Christ [Luke. 14:20]. Once Pa sent
    me this:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Zucht tot heiliging<br>

    Wie zal voor immer en volkomen ons bevrijden<br>

    Van `t lichaam dezer daad gebogen onder `t juk&hellip;<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p></p>

    <p>[Translation of the whole poem]</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    CRAVING FOR SANCTITY<br>

    Who shall deliver me completely and forever<br>

    From the body of this deed; bowed down beneath the yoke,<br>

    How long shall I have to fight against myself<br>

    Before I can tear this heart away from the service of
    sin?<br>

    <p></p>

    I had promised my God that He should be called my God,<br>

    That I should follow Him with undivided mind;<br>

    I was tried - and my oath was forgotten;<br>

    I was tempted - and my foot wavered.<br>

    <p></p>

    No, not with my own strength shall I learn to conquer -<br>

    Confess your weakness, O my soul, and self-deceit,
    begone!<br>

    The Father shall fashion the child's heart;<br>

    The Master shall be the guiding spirit of the pupil.<br>

    <p></p>

    Well then, father! Let Thy love make me capable;<br>

    My Master, take my hand, and show me Thy banner.<br>

    I stood alone - and fell; now we go together.<br>

    I broke down - Thou fightest for me and I am victorious.<br>

    <p></p>

    Only now do I feel strong, now that I feel I am weak,<br>

    Powerless in myself, all-powerful in the Lord!<br>

    Let sin tempt, let angry passions churn,<br>

    Thou, God in me! strikest down all enemies.<br>

    <p></p>

    I am sad, but it is a godly grief,<br>

    A cloud of night, but edged with the heavenly red of
    dawn;<br>

    I weep, O God! but with joy in my heart;<br>

    I bow my head, but, Father, onto thy lap.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>Who rejoices in grey hairs? Who can look behind it, like
    Felix Holt did behind the word <i>failure</i>? Who is there to
    see when the first years of life, life of youth and
    adolescence, life of worldly enjoyment and vanity will perforce
    wither - and they shall, even as the blossom falls from the
    tree - and vigorous new life shoots up, the life of love unto
    Christ Who is importunate and of sorrowing that is unrepenting,
    unto God; how then in our close dependence on God, and in the
    unmistakable and keen sensation of it, we find more favour in
    His eyes, which are too pure to see evil, and He can and will
    entrust His Holy Spirit more safely to our weakness, His Holy
    Spirit, Which grants life, and urges us to do good works; who
    rejoices in grey hairs? Who is sorrowful yet always rejoicing,
    chastised but not slain, to die but lo! we live - oh, who
    rejoices in falling and rising again, long-suffering and meek?
    - who rejoices in the green wood of the straight pines and
    cedars, and ivy and holly and moss in winter? - Withered wood
    <i>does give</i> more heat, a bright fire and light, when it is
    kindled, than green wood. &ldquo;There is no fear in love; but
    perfect love casteth out fear&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Vader onder al mijn noden<br>

    Vader onder heil en straf&hellip;<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>[Literal translation of the whole poem.]</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Father, in all my troubles<br>

    Father, in bliss and punishment<br>

    Father, even in the realm of the dead,<br>

    Father, even in the silent tomb<br>

    Whenever I may behold change<br>

    Thou, O God, standest firm forever.<br>

    My dust rests also on Thy faithful security<br>

    Slumbers in Thy home.<br>

    <p></p>

    Therefore years, speed freely on<br>

    With your gladness and your grief<br>

    Whatever disaster I may bewail<br>

    God, my God changeth not.<br>

    When we sit in mournful darkness<br>

    Still that Eternal Light will keep<br>

    All its brilliance and all its glory<br>

    Worthy of all praise and poetry.<br>

    <p></p>

    I know to Whom I entrust myself;<br>

    Though day and night may alternate,<br>

    I know the rock on which I build:<br>

    He Who awaits my salvation will not fail me.<br>

    Once in the evening of my life,<br>

    Tired of cares and struggling, I shall offer up<br>

    Unto Thee for every day granted me here<br>

    A loftier and purer song of praise.<br>

    <p></p>

    Oh my soul, why art thou bowed down<br>

    Why art thou troubled within me?<br>

    Regain thy old faith<br>

    In the joy in the praise of the Most High.<br>

    Many a time hath He changed<br>

    Thy burden into happiness.<br>

    Put thy trust in Him, raise thine eyes to Heaven<br>

    For I shall glorify my God forever.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>And above all love one another with a fervent love, for love
    shall cover a multitude of sins [<i>sic</i>. 1 Pet. 4:8].</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Waar liefde woont gebiededt de Heer Zijn zegen<br>

    Daar woont Hij zelf<br>

    Daat wordt Zijn heil verkregen<br>

    En't leven tot in eeuwigheid.<br>

    <p></p>

    [Where love dwells the Lord commands His blessing<br>

    There He lives Himself<br>

    There His Grace is won<br>

    And life eternal.]<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>Let us bear love one unto another that God may augment and
    strengthen our love, and gather love around us, and if there
    should be no human being that you can love enough, love the
    town in which you dwell, as you do, too - don't I love Paris
    and London, though I am a child of the pine woods and of the
    beach at Ramsgate? And seek to please the poor and to find
    favour in their eyes.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Strengthen thine heart.&rdquo; &ldquo;Because ye are
    sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your
    hearts, crying: Abba, Father.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is
    love.&rdquo; And this is life eternal: knowing God and Christ
    Whom He sent [John 17:3]. &ldquo;There is no fear in
    love.&rdquo; &ldquo;In my Father's house are many mansions; if
    it were not so I would have told you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with
    me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It is better to trust in the Lord than to put
    confidence in man.&rdquo; It is better to fall into the hands
    of the Lord than into the hands of men.</p>

    <p>Let Christ be the centre of your longing, Comforter of the
    disquieted mind. &ldquo;Strengthen thine heart&rdquo; also in
    this sense; eat thy <i>bread</i> in simplicity of heart; at
    least do this, I cannot do otherwise, God help me, if there be
    peril in doing it: &ldquo;Father, into thy hands I commend my
    spirit.&rdquo; Eat your bread but live simply, and smoke your
    pipe, which I do myself whenever I can manage to go out once in
    a while. &ldquo;And turn thy way unto the Lord, He will pave
    it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin] Do not be afraid to sing a hymn in
    the evening when you are out for a walk and nobody is about:
    &ldquo;As pants the hart for cooling streams, when heated in
    the chase,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Oh my soul, why art thou bowed
    down,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Centre of our craving,&rdquo; or,
    &ldquo;I know to Whom I entrust myself.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The years between twenty and thirty are full of perils of
    all kinds, full of great perils, ay, perils of sin and death,
    but also full of God's light and comfort; struggling, thou
    shalt prevail, and when the dangers are past, thou shalt recall
    them poignantly and say, It was a good time after all.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Strengthen thy charity.&rdquo; What, however, is this
    Charity Paul speaks of? And what are those wonderful words thou
    knowest also, 1 Cor. 13? This Charity is Life in Christ, this
    Charity is our Mother; all the good things of the earth belong
    to Her, for all is good if enjoyed with thankfulness, but She
    extends much further than those good things of the earth. To
    Her belongs the draught of water from a brook on a hike or from
    a fountain in the hot streets of London or Paris, to Her belong
    also &ldquo;I shall make thy bed in sickness,&rdquo; &ldquo;as
    one whom his mother comforteth, so I will comfort you,&rdquo;
    and to Her belongs: &ldquo;Constancy unto death toward Christ,
    who giveth us the strength to do all.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;There is a friend that sticketh closer than a
    brother.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Strengthen thy hope,&rdquo; for there is much that is
    good in life; for the one who loves Christ the world is what it
    is, and all things seem to fall to his share. Certainly it is
    true that much joy lies behind us, and much that we formerly
    anticipated joyfully, and if perchance much joy lies before us,
    we have seen already: &ldquo;the world passeth away, and the
    lust thereof.&rdquo; And if it be true:</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    I've found a joy in sorrow, a secret balm for pain<br>

    A beautiful tomorrow of sunshine after rain<br>

    I've found a branch of healing near every bitter spring<br>

    A whispered promise stealing (<i>from every?)</i> broken
    string.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>thus it is true that there is no joy without unhappiness.
    Sorrow is better than laughter, and it is better to go to the
    house of mourning, than to the house of feasts&hellip;for by
    the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better
    [Eccles. 7:2-3]. <i>Even in mirth the heart is sad</i>.</p>

    <p>For myself, I will strive after the Love of Christ and after
    working for Him all my life; though it fail and though I fail,
    there will always remain that standing from afar and longing
    for the heights away from the misery here below. But I will
    seek Faith and Love, and go on beseeching the Spirit of God
    under all circumstances. For this is my vow unto the Lord, my
    &hellip; [illegible], my rock. If I am forsaken, I am forsaken,
    but He is faithful and loves with an eternal Love, and grants
    that the longing of our hearts be ever green.</p>

    of Isaiah and Jeremiah: Is. 9, 11, 35, Is. 40, 42, 43, 44, 45:2

    30, 31.</p>

    <p>The Lord is thy keeper: He is thy shade upon thy right hand.
    In Him is deliverance from death, in Him is everlasting life.
    My boy, there will come days when we shall no longer believe
    because we heard <i>It</i> said, but when we shall know
    <i>It</i> and felt It and love <i>It</i>. Then we shall be
    moved, when we hear the name of God pronounced, yea, even as we
    are moved when we see our father again after having been away
    from home for a long time. And we shall all be brethren and
    sisters and children of the Shepherd, as if anew, and in many a
    sense.</p>

    <p>Let us go on in life as long as our legs will carry us, and
    though the foot may get tired, and the tribulation great, and
    though the ear may hum with the noise of the world, which it
    has heard for so many years, and though the whole head be
    weary, and the going hard, let us go on in life, because our
    Father and our Mother say unto us, &ldquo;Go on and don't look
    back&rdquo;; and if we may do good along the way, let us not
    forbear; but still, God desires more our heart than our works.
    Pa and Mother say, Go on, and they love us - did not Pa say, My
    boy, you know very well I would give my last shirt for you. Let
    us go on as long as our legs will carry us, and thou shalt find
    that God giveth strength to the weary and fortifieth him that
    is weak, that God supporteth us; for there is greater love in
    the future, therefore we delight and have faith in the life
    that is to come.</p>

    Well, brother, this is the fruit of the pen and of the
    heart.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">I am happily looking forward to Christmas; two years ago we
    took a walk in the snow in the evening, do you remember? And
    saw the moon rise over the Marienhof? I also quite clearly
    remember the night, that same Christmastide, I drove from
    Bois-le-Duc to Helvoirt in a little open cart, it was terribly
    cold and the road was slippery; how beautiful Bois-le-Duc
    looked, the market square and the streets covered with snow and
    the dark houses with snow on the roofs. Brabant is ever
    Brabant, and one's native country is ever one's native country,
    and countries of exile are ever countries of exile. And viewed
    from the distant road to Bois-le-Duc, how pleasant Helvoirt
    looked that evening and the lights in the village and the
    steeple amidst the snow-covered poplars. But it is love that
    gives it all so much beauty and animation. And do you remember
    that trip to St. Michiel's Gestel.</label></p>

    <p>&ldquo;The redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with
    singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their head:
    and they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning
    shall flee away.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter
    weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted
    for her children, because they were not.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord, Refrain thy voice from weeping,
    and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded,
    saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the
    enemy.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble
    knees.&rdquo; &ldquo;For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
    neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the
    heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than
    your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>[Written at the top of the following page] There is no
    better nor surer way to follow through life than Love, above
    all for our Father: in His name we go on from one day to the
    next. But we can also bear love unto others. How often the
    memory of one already gone to my Father's house - where there
    are many mansions - has warmed me and made my heart glow with
    Love on my evening walks through the streets of London, and in
    the cabbage fields outside the town. And as often as I walk in
    the streets of London, the thought of Him and the Love of Him
    rise up in me.</p>

    <p>When Lies came home at Christmas we had a pleasant meeting.
    She and Albertien came in Uncle Vincent's carriage from Breda.
    Pa, Cor and I went along the road to meet them, and when we saw
    the carriage in the distance I ran ahead of the other two. It
    was twilight, and the carriage was dark. Through the window one
    saw the road with the fields and a row of trees on either side.
    At the end of the road the church was dark against the sky.
    Behind the church lowered big dark evening clouds, but edged
    with silver. It was such an unexpected joy to see the little
    lass again - a much greater joy than I had anticipated.</p>

    <p>Anna will be back in Welwyn by now, I suppose; when she
    leaves Welwyn, she will realize how much she has loved it. You
    know how in winter she used to be the first to get up and light
    the fire - she has been a blessing in the house. Her little
    room is so lovely - with the ivy about the window and the view
    of the garden and the big chestnuts around which swarms of
    swallows fly in summer - when the sun is setting behind the
    trees. And the rooks nest there, too. The &ldquo;Mater
    Dolorosa&rdquo; by Delaroche hung over her bed.</p>

    <p>Do you happen to have kept that page from Michelet
    beginning, &ldquo;Je vois d'ici une dame&rdquo;? If you have,
    please copy it for me; I want it, but don't have the book any
    more.</p>

    <p>How shall these things come to pass?</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the
    sepulchre?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I will go before thee, and make the crooked places
    straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in
    sunder the bars of iron&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I am&hellip;the beginning and the end, the first and
    the last.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should
    not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may
    forget, yet will I not forget thee.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not
    with wine: &hellip;Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the
    cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou
    shalt no more drink it again.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be
    removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither
    shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord that
    hath mercy on thee.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither
    for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee; but the
    Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy
    glory. Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon
    withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light,
    and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;As one whom his Mother comforteth, so I will comfort
    you &hellip; saith the Lord. Wilt thou not from this time cry
    unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of youth? &hellip; Thou
    shalt call me, My Father; and shalt not turn away from
    me.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and
    I shall be saved.&rdquo; Redeem me, and I shall be
    redeemed.</p>

    <p>For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee &hellip;All
    thy lovers have forgotten thee &hellip; I shall restore health
    unto thee, and take the plagues away from thee.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The Lord hath appeared of old to me, saying, Yea, I
    have loved thee with an everlasting love.&rdquo; &ldquo;As one
    whom his Mother comforteth, so I will comfort you, saith the
    Lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is a friend that sticketh closer than
    a brother.&rdquo;</p>
