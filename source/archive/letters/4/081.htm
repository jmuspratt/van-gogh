  <body>
    <p>Dear Father and Mother,</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">Thank God that Theo has almost recovered, and bravo that he
    has already walked with Father in the snow to the Heike [a
    hamlet near Etten]; how I wish I could have been together with
    you both.</label> It is already late, and early tomorrow morning I must
    go to London and Lewisham, for Mr. Jones. I hope to visit the
    Gladwells, and it will be late in the evening when I come
    back.</p>

    <p>Where do Mr. Jones and others get their incomes? Yes, I have
    often thought about it myself. A saying here is: God takes care
    of those who work for Him. I am longing to speak and consult
    with you about this question.</p>

    <p>And then you asked me if I still teach the boys; generally I
    do so until one o'clock in the afternoon, and then after one
    o'clock I go out for Mr. Jones, or sometimes give lessons to
    Mr. Jones's children or to a few boys in town. And then in the
    evening and between times I write in my sermon book.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday I was at Turnham Green early to teach at Sunday
    school - it was a real English rainy day. In the morning Mr.
    Jones preached about the woman of Samaria and then there was
    Sunday school again. I have to teach it on weekdays too; there
    are children enough, but the difficulty is to get them together
    regularly. Mr. Jones and his boys and I went in the afternoon
    to take tea with the sexton, a shoemaker who lives in one of
    the suburbs. The view from the windows there reminded me of
    Holland; a grass field almost turned into a swamp by the
    pouring rain, around it rows of little red houses with their
    gardens and the glow of the lighted lamps. In the evening Mr.
    Jones preached a very beautiful sermon about Naarman the
    Syrian, and then came the walk home.</p>

    <p>Last Thursday Mr. Jones made me take his turn, and my text
    was: &ldquo;I would to God, that not only thou, but also all
    that hear me this day, were both almost, and together such as I
    am, except these bonds.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Next Sunday evening I have to go to a Methodist church in
    Petersham. Petersham is a village on the Thames, twenty minutes
    beyond Richmond. I do not know what text I shall take, The
    Prodigal Son or Psalm 42:1. In the morning and afternoon there
    is Sunday school at Turnham Green.</p>

    <p>And so the weeks go by and we are approaching winter and a
    merry Christmas. Tomorrow I must be in the two remotest parts
    of London: in Whitechapel - that very poor part which you have
    read about in Dickens; and then across the Thames in a little
    steamer and from there to Lewisham. Mr. Jones's children have
    recovered, but now three of the boys have got measles.</p>

    <p>This week I had to go with one of the boys to Acton Green
    for Mr. Jones - that grass plot which I saw from the sexton's
    window. It was very muddy there, but it was lovely when
    darkness fell and the fog began to rise and one saw the light
    of a little church in the middle of the plain. To our left were
    the railway tracks on a rather high embankment; a train passed
    by and the red glow of the engine and the rows of lights in the
    carriages were a beautiful sight in the twilight. To our right
    a few horses were grazing in a meadow surrounded by a hedge of
    hawthorn and dotted with blackberry bushes.</p>

    <p>While I sit writing to you in my little room and it is so
    very, very quiet, I look at your portraits and the prints on
    the wall - &ldquo;Christus Consolator,&rdquo; &ldquo;Good
    Friday,&rdquo; &ldquo;Women Visiting the Tomb,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;The Old Huguenot,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Prodigal Son&rdquo;
    by Ary Scheffer, &ldquo;A Little Boat on a Stormy Sea,&rdquo;
    and an etching, &ldquo;An Autumn Landscape,&rdquo; a view of a
    heath that Harry Gladwell gave me on my birthday. And when I
    think of you all and of everything here, of Turnham Green,
    Richmond and Petersham, then I feel, Hear, O Lord, the prayer
    that my mother said for me when I left my parent's roof,
    &ldquo;Father, I pray thee not that thou shouldest take him out
    of the world but that thou shouldest keep him from the
    evil,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O Lord, make me my father's brother, a
    Christian and a Christian labourer. Finish Thy work in me that
    Thou hast begun and unite us, O Lord, firmly together and may
    the love for Thee strengthen that bond more and
    more.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And now good night to you both and to Theo and Willemien and
    Cor. I am looking forward to hearing from you again. Good
    night, I must start early tomorrow morning, a handshake
    from</p>

    <p>Your most affectionate Vincent</p>

    <p>[Written underneath in pencil]</p>

    <p>From the other end of London.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, everyone! I started this morning at four o'clock,
    now it is two. I have just passed through the old cabbage
    fields - now for Lewisham. One sometimes asks, how shall I ever
    reach my destination? &Agrave; Dieu.</p>
