  <body>
    <p>Dear Father and Mother,</p>

    <p>You have probably received my telegram, but you will be glad
    to hear some more particulars. On the train I wrote down a few
    things, and I am sending them to you, so that you will know all
    about my journey.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.</p>

    <p>In thought we will stay together today. Which do you think
    is better &hellip; the joy of meeting or the sorrow of parting?
    We have often parted already; this time there was more sorrow
    in it than there used to be, but also more courage because of
    the firmer hope, the stronger desire, for God's blessing. And
    didn't nature seem to share our feelings, everything looked so
    grey and dull a few hours ago.</p>

    <p>Now I am looking across the vast expanse of meadows, and
    everything is very quiet; the sun is disappearing again behind
    the grey clouds, but sheds a golden light over the fields.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">These first hours after
    our parting - which you are spending
    in church, and I at the station and on the train - how we are
    longing for each other and how we think of the others, of Theo
    and Anna and the other little sisters and the brother. Just now
    we passed Zevenbergen; I thought of the day you took me there,
    <sup>1</sup> and I stood on the steps at Mr. Provily's, looking
    after your carriage on the wet road; and then of that evening
    when my father came to visit me for the first time. And of that
    first homecoming at Christmas!</label></p>

    <p><i>Saturday and Sunday</i>.</p>

    <p>On the steamer I thought often of Anna - everything reminded
    me of our journey together.</p>

    <p>The weather was clear, and the river was especially
    beautiful, and also the view, seen from the sea, of the dunes,
    dazzling white in the sun. The last I saw of Holland was a
    little grey church spire. I stayed on deck until sunset, but
    then it became too cold and rough.</p>

    <p>At dawn the next morning on the train from Harwich to London
    it was beautiful to see the black fields and green meadows with
    sheep and lambs and an occasional thornbush and a few large oak
    trees with dark twigs and grey moss-covered trunks; the
    shimmering blue sky with a few stars still, and a bank of grey
    clouds at the horizon. Before sunrise I had already heard the
    lark. When we were near the last station before London, the sun
    rose. The bank of grey clouds had disappeared and there was the
    sun, as simple and grand as ever I saw it, a real Easter sun.
    The grass sparkled with dew and night frost. But I still prefer
    that grey hour when we parted.</p>

    <p>Saturday afternoon I stayed on deck till the sun had set.
    The water was fairly dark blue with rather high white-crested
    waves as far as one could see. The coast had already
    disappeared from sight. The sky was one vast light blue,
    without a single little cloud. And the sunset cast a streak of
    glittering light on the water. It was indeed a grand and
    majestic sight, but still the simpler, quieter things touch one
    so much more deeply.</p>

    <p>The train for Ramsgate left two hours after I arrived in
    London. That is still about four and a half hours by train. It
    is a beautiful route; for instance, we passed one part that was
    quite hilly. At the base the hills are covered with scanty
    grass, and at the top, with oak woods. It reminded me of our
    dunes. Between the hills was a village with a grey church
    overgrown with ivy like most of the houses. The orchards were
    in full bloom and the sky was a light blue with grey and white
    clouds.</p>

    <p>We also passed Canterbury, a city with many medieval
    buildings, especially a beautiful cathedral, surrounded by old
    elm trees. I have often seen pictures of it.</p>

    <p>You can imagine, I was looking out the window for Ramsgate a
    long time before we got there.</p>

    <p>At one o'clock I arrived at Mr. Stokes's; he was not home
    but will be back tonight. During his absence his place was
    taken by his son (twenty-three years old, I think), a teacher
    in London. I saw Mrs. Stokes at dinner. There are twenty-four
    boys from ten to fourteen years. (It is a pleasant sight to see
    them at their dinner.) So the school is not large. The window
    looks out on the sea. After dinner we took a walk out on the
    shore; it was very beautiful. The houses on the shore are
    mostly built of yellow stone in simple Gothic style, and have
    gardens full of cedars and other dark evergreens. There is a
    harbour full of ships, shut in between stone jetties on which
    one can walk. And then there is the unspoiled sea, and that is
    very beautiful. Yesterday everything was grey. In the evening
    we went with the boys to church. On the wall of the church was
    written: &ldquo;Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of
    the world.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The boys go to bed at eight o'clock, and they rise at
    six.</p>

    <p>There is another assistant teacher, seventeen years old. He,
    four boys and myself sleep in another house near by, where I
    have a little room that is waiting for some prints on the
    wall.</p>

    <p>And now enough for today. What happy days we spent together!
    Thanks, thanks for everything. Love to all and a handshake
    from</p>

    <p>Your loving, Vincent</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letters, they arrived just now. I shall
    write soon, when I have been here a few days and have seen Mr.
    Stokes.</p>
