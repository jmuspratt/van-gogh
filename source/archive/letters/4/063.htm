  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many happy returns, my best wishes for this day, may our
    mutual love increase with the years.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">I am so glad that
    we have so many things in common, not only
    memories of childhood but also that you are working in the same
    business in which I was till now and know so many people and
    places which I know also, and that you have so much love for
    nature and art.</label></p>

    <p>Mr. Stokes has told me that he intends to move after the
    holidays, of course with the whole school, to a little village
    on the Thames about three hours from London. There he will
    organize his school somewhat differently and perhaps enlarge
    it.</p>

    <p>Now I am going to tell you about a walk we took yesterday.
    It was to an inlet of the sea, and the road thither led through
    fields of young corn and along hedges of hawthorn, etc.</p>

    <p>Arriving there, we saw to our left a high steep ridge of
    sand and stone as tall as a two-storey house. On the top of it
    were old, gnarled hawthorn bushes, whose black and grey
    moss-grown stems and branches were all bent to one side by the
    wind; there were also a few elder bushes.</p>

    <p>The ground on which we walked was covered all over with big
    grey stones, chalk and shells.</p>

    <p>To the right lay the sea, as calm as a pond and reflecting
    the light of the transparent grey sky where the sun was
    setting.</p>

    <p>The tide was out and the water very low.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter of yesterday, I am very glad that
    Willem Valkis is also an employee of the house. Give him my
    best regards. <label content="feelings.homesick">I wish I
    could walk once more with you through my
    woods, to Scheveningen.</label></p>

    <p>Have a pleasant day today and give my love to all who may
    ask about me and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Once more my best wishes, lad, I hope you will begin a happy
    and prosperous year. These are important years that we are
    living through now and much depends on them. May everything
    come out all right.</p>

    <p>A hearty handshake. &Agrave; Dieu.</p>
