    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>12 January 1876</p>

    <p>Vincent's problems keep giving us great concern. On the
    fourth of this month he wrote that he had had a very unpleasant
    encounter with M. Boussod at the moment of the New Year's
    wishes. He had been especially blamed for going home at the end
    of the year. He certainly should not have done it, but he
    appears to have stubbornly stuck to his point. After this
    encounter there is no other way open to him, he feels, than to
    say that he will leave the first of April.</p>

    <p>Lies to Theo</p>

    <p>27 February 1876</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">How nice for you to be allowed to make the trade journey for
    the spring season. I am sure that will be a big change for
    you.</label></p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>8 March 1876</p>

    <p>It is just as I wrote to you, it is certain that Willemien
    is not going to stay in England.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>15 March 1876</p>

    <p>Anna suggests that she will come home with Willemien in the
    beginning of May and stay with us until August. Up to that time
    she is willing to remain Willemien's governess.</p>

    <p>[Mother] And now, dear Theo, live happily. Look for the good
    things in life in all respects. Avoid what is not good. Control
    yourself in the things which you don't need but were
    recommended to you in well-meant advice.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>31 March 1876</p>

    <p>I find it a marvellous thing for you and hope that it will
    be successful. You are going to visit some interesting
    towns.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>1 July 1876</p>

    <p>If he really has such a love of the church or the
    Evangelization and is really serious about it, I would think
    that he could start the study for it in this country, and we
    might try to find the necessary resources. But at least eight
    years would be needed. On the other hand, it might be better if
    he tried to find over there or in this country - perhaps better
    in this country - some position as bookkeeper or as assistant
    in an office or shop.</p>

    <p>If he wants to teach, then he should start the study to be
    an assistant schoolmaster and try to improve himself later by
    his own exercise and study of languages. Alas, we begin to
    become more and more worried about him. Of course, the lack of
    finances is also a problem; he doesn't want us to send him
    anything, but this morning I enclosed twenty-five guilders in
    my letter to him.</p>

    <p>[Vincent's address is] c/o W. P. Stokes Esq., Linkfield
    House, Isleworth (near London).</p>

    <p>Lies to Theo</p>

    <p>18 August 1876</p>

    <p>How much worry that boy gives Father and Mother. Looking at
    them one could not fail to notice it. It is a pity he doesn't
    have a little more energy. He becomes dull with piety, I
    believe.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>8 September 1876</p>

    <p>Just now a letter from Vincent. We have not yet been able to
    read it completely due to the wriggly handwriting. But in any
    case it is not a letter that gives us pleasure, alas! If only
    he learned to remain simple as a child, and would not always go
    on filling his letter with Bible texts in such an exaggerated
    and overwrought manner. It makes us worry more and more, and I
    fear that he becomes altogether unfit for practical life; it is
    bitterly disappointing. How are his letters to you? If he wants
    to become an Evangelist, he should be ready to start the
    <i>preparation</i> and necessary <i>studies</i>; I would then
    have more confidence.</p>

    <p>Anna to Theo</p>

    <p>12 October 1876</p>

    <p>[On Theo's illness.]</p>

    <p>[I have been very worried, but] Father had written that the
    crisis is over.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>19 October 1876</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">Let us be grateful that so far you are getting somewhat
    better and let us thank God who has spared your life.</label></p>
