  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>The time may come when I shall look back with a certain
    melancholy on the &ldquo;fleshpots of Egypt,&rdquo; connected
    with other situations - that is, the bigger salaries and the
    higher worldly esteem - this I foresee.</p>

    <p>There is indeed &ldquo;plenty of bread&rdquo; in the houses
    that I shall enter if I continue along the road which I have
    taken, but there is not plenty of money. And yet I see a light
    in the distance so clearly; if that light disappears now and
    then, it is generally my own fault.</p>

    <p>It is very doubtful whether I shall make great progress in
    this profession, whether the six years spent in the house of
    Messrs. Goupil and Co., - during which time I ought to have
    prepared myself for <i>this</i> profession - will not always
    remain an insuperable obstacle. However, I think I cannot now
    draw back in any way, even if a part of me should wish to
    (<i>later on - at present this is not the case</i>).</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">Lately it has seemed
    to me that there are no professions in
    the world other than those of schoolmaster and clergyman, with
    all that lies between these two - such as missionary,
    especially a London missionary, etc.</label> I think it must be a
    peculiar profession to be a London missionary; one has to go
    around among the labourers and the poor to preach the Bible,
    and as soon as one has some experience, talk with them, find
    foreigners who are looking for work or other persons who are in
    difficulties and try and help them, etc., etc. Last Sunday, I
    went to London two or three times to find out if there was a
    chance of becoming one of them, as I speak a number of
    languages and have mixed, especially in Paris and London, with
    people of the lower classes and foreigners. Being a foreigner
    myself, I thought I might be fit for it and might become
    increasingly so. However, one must be at least twenty-four
    years old, and at all events I shall have to wait another
    year.</p>

    <p>Mr. Stokes says that he definitely cannot give me any salary
    because he can get teachers enough for just board and lodging,
    and that is true. But will it be possible for me to continue
    this way? I am afraid not; it will be decided soon enough.</p>

    <p>But, my boy, however this may be, one thing I can repeat:
    these few months have bound me so strongly to the sphere that
    extends from schoolmaster to clergyman, as much by the
    pleasures connected with those professions as by the thorns
    which have pricked me, that I cannot draw back any more. So I
    have to go on!</p>

    <p>I can assure you that some very peculiar difficulties will
    present themselves right away, and others are looming in the
    distance; one is in quite a different world from that of
    Messrs. Goupil and Co.</p>

    <p>When will I get those small engravings, &ldquo;Christus
    Consolator&rdquo; and &ldquo;Remunerator,&rdquo; which you
    promised me? Write to me as soon as you can find a moment, but
    send your letter to Father, as my address will probably change
    very soon, and he will know it first.</p>

    <p>Last week, I was at Hampton Court to see the beautiful
    gardens and long avenues of horse chestnuts and lime trees, in
    the tops of which a multitude of crows and rooks have built
    their nests, and also to see the palace and the paintings.
    Among other things there are many portraits by Holbein which
    are very beautiful; two splendid Rembrandts (the portrait of
    his wife, and of a rabbi); beautiful Italian portraits by
    Bellini, Titian; a picture by Leonardo da Vinci; cartoons by
    Mantegna; a beautiful picture by S. Ruysdael; a still life of
    fruit by Cuyp, etc. I wish you had been there with me; it was a
    pleasure to see pictures again.</p>

    <p>And involuntarily I thought of the persons who had lived
    there at Hampton Court, of Charles I and his wife (she is the
    one who said: &ldquo;Thank you, Lord, for making me a Queen,
    but an unhappy Queen&rdquo;) at whose tomb Bossuet spoke from
    the fullness of his heart. Do you have Bossuet's Oraisons
    Fun&egrave;bres? In it you will find that speech (there is a
    very cheap edition, I think for 50 centimes); and I thought
    also of Lord and Lady Russell, who must have been there very
    often, too (Guizot described their lives in L'amour dans le
    mariage - you must read that when you can lay your hands on
    it).</p>

    <p>Enclosed, a feather from one of the rooks there.</p>

    <p>Write as soon as you can, I long to hear from you, believe
    me with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
