  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Yesterday, I went to see Gladwell, who is home for a few
    days. A terrible blow has struck them, his young sister, so
    full of life, with dark eyes and hair, had fallen from a horse
    at Blackheath; they found her unconscious and she died five
    hours later, without regaining consciousness. She was seventeen
    years old.</p>

    <p>As soon as I heard the news, I went to see them, knowing
    that Gladwell was home. I left at eleven o'clock; and had a
    long walk to Lewisham. I crossed London from one end to the
    other and didn't arrive at my destination until almost five
    o'clock.</p>

    <p>They had all just come back from the funeral; the whole
    household was in mourning.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.death">I was happy to have come, but confused, truly upset by the
    spectacle of a pain so great and so venerable.</label> &ldquo;Blessed
    are they that mourn, blessed are they that sorrow, but always
    rejoice, blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.
    Blessed are those that find love on their road, who are bound
    together by God, for to them all things will work together for
    their good.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I chatted for a long time, until evening, with Harry, about
    everything, the kingdom of God, the Bible; we chatted further,
    we walked up and down the station platform. Never will we
    forget the moments before we said goodbye.</p>

    <p>He and I, we know each other intimately; his work is mine, I
    know as well as he the people that he knows down here, their
    lives are as mine. From him, I have been given an urge to dive
    into the history of this family; I love these people, more now
    that I know their history in detail, because now I can
    sympathize with them on their existence and style of life.</p>

    <p>So then, we walked up and down the platform of the station,
    an ordinary world, but we were animated by thoughts that were
    not ordinary. Such moments do not last long, and soon we had to
    part.</p>

    <p>From the train the view of London was beautiful, squatting
    in its gloom, with Saint Paul's and the other churches in the
    distance. I went by train to Richmond, and by foot to
    Isleworth, along the Thames. A fine walk. To the left, there
    are parks with their poplars, their oaks and gigantic elms; to
    the right, the river which reflects their images. The evening
    is fine, somewhat solemn. I got back home at quarter past
    ten.</p>

    <p>Thanks for your last letter. You had not yet written that
    Mrs. V. was dead; how often I accompanied her home in the
    evening. How I should have liked to walk with you all to the
    Hoeve!</p>

    <p>I often teach the boys Bible history, and last Sunday
    morning, I read the Bible with them. Every morning and evening
    we read the Bible and sing hymns and pray. And that is a good
    thing. We also go to Ramsgate. While these twenty-one boys of
    the London streets and markets pray <i>Our Father, who art in
    heaven, give us this day our daily bread</i><i>,</i> I imagine
    the cry of a young crow which the Lord hears, and it did me
    good to pray with them and to bow my head lower than they
    probably did at the words, &ldquo;Lead us not into temptation
    but deliver us from evil.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.death">I am still full of what happened yesterday. I wanted to
    console the father, but I felt embarrassed in front of him,
    although I was able to speak to the son. The atmosphere of that
    house was truly holy.</label></p>

    <p>Have you ever read A Life for a Life, by the author of John
    Halifax? <sup>1</sup> I am sure you would like that. How is
    your English coming? It was delightful to take a long walk once
    more; here at school they walk very little. When I think of my
    life full of struggle in Paris last year and compare it with
    this, where I sometimes do not get out-of-doors the whole day -
    at least not farther than the garden - I sometimes wonder; When
    shall I come back to that other world? If I go back to it, it
    will probably be doing other work than last year. But I think I
    like teaching Bible history to the boys better than walking;
    one feels more or less safe in doing the former. And now kind
    regards to Roos and to anybody who may ask after me. A
    handshake in thought and best wishes from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Enclosed is a letter for Mauve which you may read. I think
    it is right not to forget one's former acquaintances, therefore
    I occasionally write to some of them, also to Soek in Paris and
    others.</p>

    <p>I write between school hours and rather in a hurry as you
    can see; if you can persuade somebody to read Eliot's Scenes
    from Clerical Life and Felix Holt, you will be doing a good
    deed. The former is so splendid!</p>
