  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I arrived here safely yesterday, at about one in the
    afternoon. The first thing that struck me was that the windows
    of this not so very big school look out onto the sea. It is a
    boarding school, and there are twenty-four boys from ten to
    fourteen years old. Mr. Stokes is on a trip for a few days, and
    so I haven't seen him yet. They expect him this evening. There
    is another assistant teacher seventeen years old.</p>

    <p>Last night and this morning, we all went for a walk along
    the seashore. Enclosed is a spray of seaweed.</p>

    <p>On the waterfront, most of the houses are built of yellow
    brick in the style of those in Nassaulaan in The Hague, but
    they are higher and have gardens full of cedars and evergreen
    trees of a somber green.</p>

    <p>Dikes of stone, upon which you can walk, protect the
    harbour, where all sorts of ships are tied up. Yesterday
    everything was grey.</p>

    <p>By and by I shall go and unpack my trunks, which have just
    been delivered, and I am going to hang some prints in my
    room.</p>

    <p>The holidays are not yet over, so I have not had to give any
    lessons so far. I am anxious to see Mr. Stokes.</p>

    <p>I must go for a walk with the boys.</p>

    <p>Adieu, always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
