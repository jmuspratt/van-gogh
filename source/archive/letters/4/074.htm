  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Enclosed you will find a note for Mr. Tersteeg; the last
    time I wrote to him I was still in Paris and it is time he had
    another letter. We have not lost track of each other since I
    left The Hague.</p>

    <p>The morning is beautiful, the sunlight falls across the
    enormous acacias in the courtyard, it lights up the roofs and
    windows visible beyond the garden. There are already gossamer
    threads in the garden, it makes the morning fresh and the boys
    run left and right to warm themselves up.</p>

    <p>I intend to recount to them this evening, in the dormitory,
    the story of John and Theogenes. I often tell them stories in
    the evening, for instance, the Conscript, by Conscience, or
    Madame Th&eacute;r&egrave;se by Erckmann-Chatrian, and New
    Years Eve by Jean Paul - which I am sending you at the same
    time - and Andersen's Fairy Tales, such as The Story of a
    Mother, the Red Shoes, The Little Matchseller; King Robert of
    Sicily by Longfellow, etc. I sometimes tell them episodes from
    Dutch history.</p>

    <p>Every day we study the Bible; this gives us the best
    feelings of joy.</p>

    <p>No day passes without praying to God and without talking
    about Him. For the moment, my talks about Him leave much to be
    desired, but it will get better with His help and blessing.</p>

    <p>Did I ever tell you about that picture by Boughton,
    &ldquo;The Pilgrim's Progress&rdquo;? It is towards evening. A
    sandy path leads over the hills to a mountain on which one can
    see the Holy City, lit by the sun setting red behind the grey
    evening clouds. On the path, a pilgrim on his way to the city.
    He is already tired and asks a woman in black, who is standing
    on the path and whose name is 'Sorrowful yet always
    rejoicing':</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Does the road go uphill then all the way?<br>

    'Yes to the very end.'<br>

    And will the journey take all day long?<br>

    'From morn till night, my friend.'<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>The landscape through which the path runs is very beautiful,
    brown heathland with birches and pine trees here and there and
    patches of yellow sand, and in the distance the mountains
    against the sun. Truly, it is not a picture but an
    inspiration.</p>

    <p>I am writing to you between lessons. Today I took a few
    moments off to go for a walk between the hedgerows with 'John
    and Theogenes' to study it. How I wish you could see the
    playground and the garden beyond, now, in the twilight. The gas
    is flickering in the school and one can hear the companionable
    sound of the boys at their lessons. Now and then one of them
    starts to hum a snatch of some hymn or other, and then there is
    something of the &ldquo;old faith&rdquo; in me.<label content="feelings.ambition"> I am still far
    from being what I want to be, but with God's help I shall
    succeed. I want - to be bound to Christ with unbreakable bonds
    and to feel these bonds. To be sorrowful yet always rejoicing.
    To live in and for Christ, to be one of the poor of His
    Kingdom, steeped in the leaven, filled with His spirit,
    impelled by His Love, reposing in the Father with the repose of
    which I wrote to you in my last letter. To become one who finds
    repose in Him alone, who desires nothing but Him on earth, and
    who abides in the Love of God and Christ, in whom we are
    fervently bound to one another.</label></p>

    <p>Thanks for your postcard. Mr. Jones has not yet decided what
    he will do. My compliments to all who may ask after me, a
    handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>One word more. I have just been telling the story of John
    and Theogenes, first in the dormitory, then in the upper room
    where there are four more; I told it in the dark, and they had
    gradually all fallen asleep before I had finished speaking. No
    wonder, for they have raced about a great deal today on the
    playground, and then, you see, I do not speak without
    difficulty, how it sounds to English ears, I do not know, but
    &ldquo;practice makes perfect.&rdquo; I think the Lord has
    taken me as I am, with all my faults, though I am still hoping
    for more profound acceptance.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow evening, I must tell the same story to the
    assistant and two older boys who could stay up later. We eat
    our bread together in the evenings. While I was telling my
    story, I heard a piano playing, down below, the tune of
    &ldquo;Tell me the old, old story.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>The hour is very late and the rules do not allow me to work
    so late. Soon I am going to smoke a pipe in the courtyard, it
    is nice there, also in the little courtyard where a pig has his
    liberty during most of the year (he is not there at the
    moment). In truth, it is amusing to amble about a while.</p>

    <p>Now, good night, sleep well and, if you pray in the
    evenings, think of me as I remember you. Good night, my boy. A
    handshake from</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    The heart that is fainting<br>

    May grow full to o'erflowing<br>

    And they who behold it<br>

    Shall wonder and know not<br>

    That God at its fountains<br>

    Far off has been raining.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
