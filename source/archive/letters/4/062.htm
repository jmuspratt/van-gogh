    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    Enclosed you will find a postal order of ten shillings and
    an advertisement for Anna.<br>

    Be so kind as to have it put in any paper you think best. If
    it is not enough, I shall send you the rest, and if it is too
    much, buy some photographs with it and send them to Etten on
    May 21[their parent's silver wedding], but at all events tell
    me how much you paid for the advertisement and where it was
    placed, in case I should need to do it again.<br>

    Today, Mr. Stokes has returned. He is man of medium height;
    he is completely bald, and wears whiskers. They say that the
    boys respect him, but they love him just the same; ten hours
    after he arrived, they were playing marbles with him.<br>

    We often go to the beach; this morning I helped the boys
    make a sandcastle, like we used to make in the garden at
    Zundert.<br>

    I wish you could catch a look out of the windows of the
    school. The residence looks out on a square (all the houses in
    this square look the same, it's often the case here), in the
    middle of which is a large lawn enclosed by an iron fence and
    lined with lilacs. This is where the boys play at midday. The
    house where I have my room is in the same square.<br>

    When I was in Rotterdam and heard that I had a long wait, I
    was on the point of coming to The Hague; I even went to the
    station. Yet I did not go. <label content="feelings.homesick">Later on I hope to see everything
    and everybody there with a calmer eye.<br>

    I shall never forget leaving those at home on Good Friday.</label>
    In the morning we went to church at the Hoeve <sup>1</sup> and
    received communion; Father's text was, &ldquo;Arise, let us go
    hence.&rdquo;<br>

    And in the afternoon we did arise, and from the carriage
    window I saw Father and our little brother standing on the
    road, looking after the train.<br>

    And Sunday afternoon I was at the church in Ramsgate, and
    there I was struck by the words on the wall which you will find
    in Anna's letter (which I enclose).<br>

    Compliments to Roos and to everybody who may ask after me. A
    firm handshake from<br>

    Your loving brother, Vincent<br>

    <p>1. A little village in the neighbourhood of Etten.</p>
