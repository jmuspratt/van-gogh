  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is Saturday again and I write once more.<label content="feelings.homesick"> How I long to
    see you again, Oh! my longing is sometimes so strong. Write
    soon, a little word as to how you are.</label></p>

    <p>Last Wednesday we took a
    long walk to a village an hour's distance from here. The road
    led through meadows and fields, along hedges of hawthorn, full
    of blackberries and clematis, and here and there a large elm
    tree. It was so beautiful when the sun set behind the grey
    clouds, and the shadows were long. By chance we met the school
    of Mr. Stokes, where there are still several of the boys I
    knew. The clouds retained their red hue long after the sun had
    set and the dusk had settled over the fields, and we saw in the
    distance the lamps lit in the village. While I was writing to
    you, I was called to Mr. Jones, who asked if I would walk to
    London to collect some money for him. And when I came home in
    the evening, hurrah, there was a letter from Father with
    tidings about you. How I should like to be with you both, my
    boy. <label content="Theo.health">And thank God there is some improvement, though you are
    still weak. </label>And you will be longing to see Mother, and now that
    I hear that you are going home with her, I think of the words
    of Conscience:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I have been ill, my mind was tired, my soul
    disillusioned and my body suffering. I whom God has endowed at
    least with moral energy and a strong instinct of affection, I
    fell in the abyss of the most bitter discouragement and I felt
    with horror how a deadly poison penetrated my stifled heart. I
    spent three months on the moors, you know that beautiful region
    where the soul retires within itself and enjoys a delicious
    rest, where everything breathes calm and peace; where the soul
    in presence of God's immaculate creation throws off the yoke of
    conventions, forgets society, and loosens its bonds, with the
    strength of renewed youth; where each thought takes the form of
    prayer, where everything that is not in harmony with fresh and
    free nature quits the heart. Oh, there the tired souls find
    rest, there the exhausted man regains his youthful strength. So
    I passed my days of illness . . .. And then the evening! To be
    seated before the big fireplace with one's feet in the ashes,
    one's eyes fixed on a star that sends its ray through the
    opening in the chimney as if to call me, or absorbed in vague
    dreams too much to look at the fire, to see the flames rise,
    flicker, and supplant one another as if desirous to lick the
    kettle with their tongues of fire, and to think that such is
    human life: to be born, to work, to love, to grow and to
    disappear.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Mr. Jones has promised me that I shall not have to teach so
    much in future, but that I may work in his parish, visiting the
    people, talking with them, etc. May God give His blessing to
    me.</p>

    <p>Now I am going to tell you about my walk to London. I left
    here at twelve o'clock in the morning and reached my
    destination between five and six. When I came into that part of
    the town where most of the picture galleries are, around the
    Strand, I met many acquaintances: it was dinnertime, so many
    were in the street, leaving the office or going back there.
    First I met a young clergyman who once preached here, and with
    whom I then became acquainted, and then the employee of Mr.
    Wallis, and then one of the Messrs. Wallis himself, whom I used
    to visit now and then at his house, now he has two children;
    then I met Mr. Reid and Mr. Richardson, <sup>1</sup> who are
    already old friends. Last year about this time Mr. Richardson
    was in Paris and we walked together to P&egrave;re
    Lachaise.</p>

    <p>After that I went to van Wisselingh, where I saw sketches
    for two church windows. In the middle of one window stands the
    portrait of a middle-aged lady, oh, such a noble face, with the
    words &ldquo;Thy will be done,&rdquo; over it, and in the other
    window the portrait of her daughter, with the words,
    &ldquo;Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
    of things not seen.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup> There, and in the
    gallery of Messrs. Goupil &amp; Co., I saw beautiful pictures
    and drawings. It is such an intense delight to be so often
    reminded of Holland by art.</p>

    <p>In the City I went to see Mr. Gladwell and to St. Paul's
    Church. And from the City to the other end of London, where I
    visited a boy who had left the school of Mr. Stokes because of
    illness and I found him quite well, playing in the street. Then
    to the place where I had to collect the money for Mr. Jones.
    The suburbs of London have a peculiar charm, between the little
    houses and gardens are open spots covered with grass and
    generally with a church or school or workhouse in the middle
    between the trees and shrubs, and it can be so beautiful there,
    when the sun is setting red in the thin evening mist.</p>

    <p>Yesterday evening it was so, and afterwards I wished you
    could have seen those London streets when the twilight began to
    fall and the lamps were lit, and everybody went home;
    everything showed that it was Saturday night and in all that
    bustle there was peace, one felt the need of and the
    excitement at the approaching Sunday. Oh, those Sundays and
    all that is done and accomplished on those Sundays, it is such
    a comfort for those poor districts and crowded streets.</p>

    <p>In the City it was dark, but it was a beautiful walk along
    the row of churches one has to pass. Near the Strand I took a
    bus that took me quite a long way, it was already pretty late.
    I passed the little church of Mr. Jones and saw in the
    distance another one, where at that hour a light was still
    burning; I entered and found it to be a very beautiful little
    Catholic church, where a few women were praying. Then I came to
    that dark park about which I have written you already and from
    there I saw in the distance the lights of Isleworth and the
    church with the ivy, and the churchyard with the weeping
    willows beside the Thames.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">Tomorrow I shall get for the second time some small salary
    for my new work, and with it buy a pair of new boots and a new
    hat. And then, with God's will, I shall go fitted out
    afresh.</label></p>

    <p>In the London streets they sell scented violets everywhere,
    they flower here twice a year. I bought some for Mrs. Jones to
    make her forget the pipe I smoke now and then, especially late
    in the evening on the playground, but the tobacco here has a
    touch of gloom about it.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">Well, Theo, try to get well soon and read this letter when
    Mother is sitting with you, because I should like to be with
    you both in thought. I cannot tell you how glad I am that Mr.
    Jones has promised to give me work in his parish, so that I
    shall find by and by what I want. I am longing so much for you.
    A handshake for yourself and one for Mother when she is sitting
    beside you. Many regards to the Roos family and to everyone I
    know, especially to Mr. Tersteeg. Tell Mother it was delightful
    to put on a pair of socks knitted by her, after that long walk
    to London.</label></p>

    <p>This morning the sun rose so beautifully again, I see it
    every morning when I wake the boys, &agrave; Dieu.</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
