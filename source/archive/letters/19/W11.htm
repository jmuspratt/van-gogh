    <p>Letter W11<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Arles, 30 April 1889</p>

    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p>Your letter affected me above all because I learned from it
    that you have returned in order to nurse Mme. Duquesne.</p>

    <p>Cancer is certainly a terrible disease - as for me, I always
    tremble when I see a case of it - and this is no rare
    occurrence in the South, though it is often not the real,
    incurable and mortal cancer, but cancerous tumors from which
    people occasionally recover. However this may be, I think it
    very brave of you, Sister, not to shrink from this Gethsamane.
    I feel I am less brave than you, when I think of such things,
    for I feel clumsy, unwieldy, awkward in their presence. If my
    memory does not deceive me, we have a Dutch proverb bearing on
    this - They are not the worst fruits that wasps gnaw at
    &hellip;</p>

    <p>This leads me straight to what I wanted to say. The ivy
    loves the old branchless willow - every spring the ivy loves
    the trunk of the old oak tree - and in the same way cancer,
    that mysterious plant, so often fastens on people whose lives
    were nothing but love and devotion. However terrible the
    mystery of these sufferings may be, yet there is in reality
    something sweet and pathetically touching about it, which has
    the same effect as seeing the abundant growth of green moss on
    the old thatched roof. All the same I know nothing about it,
    and I haven't the right to assert anything.</p>

    <p>Not very far from here there is an old, old tomb, much older
    than Christ's sepulcher, bearing the following inscription:
    &ldquo;Blessed be Thebe, daughter of Telhui, priestess of
    Osiris, who never complained of anyone.&rdquo; I could not help
    thinking of this when you told me that the patient you are
    nursing never complains &hellip;</p>

    <p>Mother will doubtless be pleased with Theo's marriage, and
    he writes me that she seems to be getting younger in
    appearance. This pleases me very much indeed. Now he too is
    very contented with his experience of matrimony, and feels
    considerably reassured. He has very few illusions about it all,
    for he possesses to a rare degree that strength of mind which
    enables him to take things as they are without expressing
    himself about the good or the bad of them. And he is quite
    right in this, for what do we know about what we are doing?</p>

    <p>As for myself, I am going to an asylum in St.
    R&eacute;my, not far from here, for three months. <label content="health.mental">I have
    had in all four great crises, during which I didn't in the
    least know what I said, what I wanted and what I did. Not
    taking into account that I had previously had three fainting
    fits without any plausible reason, and without retaining the
    slightest remembrance of what I felt.</p>

    <p>Well, this is bad enough, the fact is that I have been much
    calmer since then, and that I am perfectly well physically.</label> I
    still feel incapable of taking a new studio. Notwithstanding
    this I am working, and have just finished two pictures of the
    hospital, <art id=0646>one of a ward, a very long ward, with rows of beds
    with white curtains, in which some figures of patients are
    moving. The walls, the ceiling with big beams, all in white,
    lilac-white or green-white. Here and there a window with a pink
    or bright green curtain. The floor paved with red bricks. At
    the end a door with a crucifix over it. It is all very, very
    simple</art>. And then, as a pendant,<art id=0519> the inner
    court. It is an arcaded gallery like those one finds in Arab
    buildings, all white-washed. In front of those galleries an
    antique garden with a pond in the middle, and eight flower
    beds, forget-me-nots, Christmas roses, anemones, ranunculus,
    wallflowers, daisies, and so on. And under the gallery orange
    trees and oleander</art>. So it is a picture quite
    full of flowers and vernal green. However, three gloomy black
    tree trunks pass through it like serpents, and in the
    foreground four big dismal clusters of somber box shrub. It is
    probable that people here won't see very much in it, but
    nevertheless it has always been my great desire to paint for
    those who do not know the artistic aspect of a picture.</p>

    <p>What shall I say? You don't know the arguments of the good
    Father Pangloss in Voltaire's Candide, nor do you know
    Flaubert's Bouvard and P&eacute;cuchet.<sup>2</sup> These
    are books written by men for men, and I don't know whether
    women can understand them. But the memory of them often
    sustains me in the hours and days and nights that are hardly
    easy or enviable.</p>

    <p>I have reread Uncle Tom's Cabin by Beecher Stowe with
    <i>extreme attention</i>, for the very reason that it is a book
    written by a woman, written, as she tells us, while she was
    making soup for the children - and after that, also with
    extreme attention, Charles Dickens's Christmas Tales.</p>

    <p>I read a little in order to meditate all the more. It is
    very probable that I shall have to suffer a great deal yet. And
    to tell the honest truth, this does not suit me at all, for
    under no circumstances do I long for a martyr's career. For I
    have always sought something different from heroism, which I do
    not have, which I certainly admire in others, but which, I tell
    you again, I consider neither my duty nor my ideal.</p>

    <p>I haven't reread the excellent books by Renan, but how often
    I think of them here, where we have olive trees and other
    characteristic plants, and the blue sky &hellip;</p>

    <p>Oh, how right Renan is, and how beautiful that work of his,
    in which he speaks to us in a French that nobody else speaks. A
    French that contains, <i>in the sound of the words</i>, the
    blue sky, the soft rustling of the olive trees, and finally a
    thousand <i>true and explanatory</i> things which give his
    History the character of a Resurrection. One of the saddest
    things I know is that prejudice of people who in their
    self-conceit oppose so many good and beautiful things which
    were created in our own time. Ah, the eternal
    &ldquo;ignorance,&rdquo; the eternal misunderstandings - and
    how much good it does one to come across a word which is really
    serene &hellip;</p>

    <p>Blessed be Thebe, daughter of Telhui, priestess of Osiris,
    who never complained of anyone.</p>

    <p>As for me, I am rather often uneasy in my mind, because I
    think that my life has not been calm enough; all those bitter
    disappointments, adversities, changes keep me from developing
    fully and naturally in my artistic career.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A rolling stone gathers no moss,&rdquo; they say,
    don't they?</p>

    <p>But what does it matter, seeing that, as the above-mentioned
    Father Pangloss proves all by himself &ldquo;[que] tout va pour
    le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Last year I did ten or a dozen orchards in bloom, and this
    year I have done only four, so the work doesn't go very
    vigorously.</p>

    <p>If you have the book by Dr&ocirc;ne which you speak
    about I should like very much to read it, but do me the favour
    of <i>not</i> buying it expressly for me at the present moment.
    I have seen very interesting nuns here, but the majority of the
    priests seem to be in a wretched state. I have been so afraid
    of religion for many years. For instance, do you happen to know
    that love may not exist in the way people imagine? - the
    resident physician here, the worthiest man you could possibly
    imagine to yourself, the most devoted, the most courageous, a
    warm and manly heart, amuses himself now and then by mystifying
    the good women here by telling them that love is a microbe. And
    when on hearing this the good women and even some men raise a
    loud outcry, he doesn't care a rap, and remains imperturbable
    on this point. And as regards kissing, all the other things we
    like to do in addition, these are only actions of a natural order,
    like drinking a glass of water or eating a slice of bread.
    Certainly kissing is rather indispensable, otherwise serious
    disorders might result. Now must the intellectual sympathies
    always go with or without what went on previously? Why regulate
    all this, what is the good of it?</p>

    <p>As far as I'm concerned, I won't dispute that love is a
    microbe, and notwithstanding this it would not prevent one from
    feeling something like respect in the face of the sufferings
    caused by cancer, for instance.</p>

    <p>And look here, the doctors, who you say cannot do very much
    now and then, which you are at liberty to say as often as you
    think proper - very well - but do you know what they can do
    nevertheless? - they can press your hand more cordially and
    more gently than many other people can, and their presence may
    at times be very sympathetic and reassuring.</p>

    <p>Look here, very often I let myself talk on and on, and yet I
    cannot write two lines, and I am much afraid that this time too
    my ideas are futile and incoherent.</p>

    <p>Only in any case I wanted to write you a letter which you
    would receive while you're there.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I am unable to describe exactly what is the matter with me;
    now and then there are horrible fits of anxiety, apparently
    without cause, or otherwise a feeling of emptiness and fatigue
    in the head.</label></p>

    <p>I look upon the whole thing as a simple accident.<label content="psychology.depression"> There
    can be no doubt that much of this is my own fault, and at times I
    have attacks of melancholy and of atrocious remorse; but you
    know, the fact is, that when all this discourages me and gives
    me spleen, I am not ashamed to tell myself that the remorse and
    all the other things that are wrong might possibly be caused by
    microbes too, like love.</label></p>

    <p>Every day I take the remedy which the incomparable Dickens
    prescribes against suicide. It consists of a glass of wine, a
    piece of bread with cheese and a pipe of tobacco. This is not
    complicated, you will tell me, and you will hardly be able to
    believe that this is the limit to which melancholy will take
    me; all the same, at some moments - oh dear me &hellip;</p>

    <p>Well, it is not always pleasant, but I do my best not to
    forget altogether how to make contemptuous fun of it. I try to
    avoid everything that has any connection with heroism or
    martyrdom; in short, I do my best not to take lugubrious things
    lugubriously.</p>

    <p>Now I wish you good night, and my kind regards to your
    patient, though I do not know her.</p>

    <p>All yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I do not know whether Lies is at Soesterberg at the moment;
    if she is there, remember me most kindly to her.</p>
