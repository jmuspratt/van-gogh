  <body>
    <p>Monsieur Gogh,</p>

    <p>I should have liked to have had the honour of announcing an
    improvement in your brother's health.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, I can't. Yesterday, Thursday, my wife went to
    see him, and he hid his face when he saw her coming. When she
    spoke to him, he replied well enough, and talked to her about
    our little girl, and asked if she was still as pretty as ever.
    Today, Friday, I went there but could not see him.<label content="health.mental"> The intern
    and the attendant told me that after my wife left, he had had a
    terrible attack; he had a very bad night, and they had to put
    him in an isolated room. Since he has been locked in this room,
    he has eaten no food and utterly refused to talk. That is the
    exact state of your brother at present.</label></p>

    <p>The intern has told me that the doctor has for a few days
    postponed the decision to have him placed in a mental hospital
    in Aix.</p>

    <p>Please, Monsieur, accept my sincere greetings.</p>

    <p>Roulin, Joseph</p>
