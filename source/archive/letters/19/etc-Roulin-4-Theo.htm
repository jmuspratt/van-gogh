    <p>Roulin 4 to Theo</p>

    <p>4 January 1889</p>

    <p>Monsieur Gogh,</p>

    <p>I am truly happy today. I went to the hospital to get my
    friend Vincent and take him for a little fresh air. We went to
    the house, he was pleased to see his paintings again; we stayed
    four hours; he has completely recovered, it is really
    surprising. I am very sorry my first letters were so alarming,
    and beg your pardon for it. I am glad to say I have been
    mistaken in his lot. He only regrets all the trouble he has
    given you, and is sorry for the anxiety he has caused. Don't
    worry; I will do all I can to give him some distraction; one of
    these days he will leave the hospital and go back to his
    paintings. That is all he thinks of, he is a sweet as a
    lamb.</p>

    <p>The intern was rather uneasy about letting him go, so I told
    him that I would take it upon myself to accompany him and bring
    him back to the hospital. By the time you receive my letter, I
    shall be with him again to spend some hours together. The
    intern and Vincent have agreed to meet me tomorrow at the
    Caf&eacute; Ginoux so that he can show his paintings.</p>
  </body>
