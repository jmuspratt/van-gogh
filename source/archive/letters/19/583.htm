  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>A few words to wish you and your fianc&eacute;e all
    happiness these days. <label content="attitude.reclusive">It is a sort of nervous affliction with
    me that on festive occasions I generally find difficulty in
    formulating good wishes, but you must not conclude from that
    that I wish you happiness less earnestly than anyone else, as
    you well know.</label></p>

    <p>I have still to thank you for your last letter,<label content="art.supplies"> as well as
    for the consignment of paints from Tasset and for several
    numbers of Le Fifre with drawings by Forain. These last
    especially had the effect on me of making me see my own stuff
    as very sentimental beside them.</label></p>

    <p>I waited several days before answering, not knowing which
    day you were leaving for Amsterdam. Besides I do not know
    either if you are getting married in Breda or in Amsterdam. But
    if as I am inclined to think it will be in Amsterdam, then I
    have assumed that you would find this letter there by
    Sunday.</p>

    <p>By the way - just today our friend Roulin came to see me. He
    told me to give you many greetings from him and to congratulate
    you. His visit gave me a lot of pleasure; he often has to carry
    loads you would call too heavy, but it doesn't prevent him, as
    he has the strong constitution of the peasant, from always
    looking well and even jolly. But for me, who am perpetually
    learning from him afresh, what a lesson for the future it is
    when one gathers from his talk that life does not grow any
    easier as one gets on in life.</p>

    <p>I talked to him so as to have his opinion as to what I ought
    to do about the Studio, which I have to leave in any case at
    Easter, according to the advice of M. Salles and M. Rey.</p>

    <p>I said to Roulin that having done a good many things to put
    the house into a far better state than when I took it,
    especially as regards the gas I had put in, I considered it as
    a definite piece of work.</p>

    <p>They are forcing me to leave - very well - but I should be
    pretty well justified in taking away the gas and making a
    rumpus about damages or something only I haven't the heart to
    do it.</p>

    <p>The only thing I feel I can do in this business is to tell
    myself that it was an attempt to make an abiding place for
    unknown successors. Besides, before seeing Roulin I had already
    been to the gas works to arrange it this way. And Roulin was of
    the same opinion. He expects to stay in Marseilles.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">I am well just now, except for a certain undercurrent of
    vague sadness difficult to define</label> - but anyway - I have rather
    gained than lost in physical strength, and I am working.</p>

    <p>Just now I have on the easel <art id=0514>an orchard of peach trees
    beside a road with the Alpilles in the background</art>. It seems that there was a fine article
    in the Figaro on Monet, Roulin had read it and been struck by it, he said.
    Altogether it is a rather difficult problem to decide whether
    to take a new flat, and even to find it, especially by the
    month.</p>

    <p>M. Salles has spoken to me of a house at 20 francs which is
    very nice, but he is not sure if I could have it. At Easter I
    shall have to pay three months' rent, the removal, etc. All
    this is not very cheering or convenient, especially as there
    seems no prospect of any better luck anywhere.</p>

    <p>Roulin said or rather hinted that he did not at all like the
    disquiet which has reigned here in Arles this winter,
    considered even quite apart from what has fallen on me.</p>

    <p>After all it is rather like that everywhere, business not
    too good, resources exhausted, people discouraged and ... as
    you said, not content to remain spectators, and becoming
    nuisances from being out of work - if anybody can still make a
    joke or work fast, down they come on him.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">And now, my dear lad, I do believe I shall soon not be ill
    enough to have to stay shut up. Otherwise I am beginning to get
    used to it, and if I had to stay for good in an asylum, I
    should make up my mind to it and I think I could find subjects
    for painting there as well.</label></p>

    <p>Write to me soon if you can find the time.</p>

    <p>Roulin's family was still in the country and though he earns
    slightly more, the separate expenses are greater in proportion,
    and so they are not really a farthing better off and he was not
    without very heavy anxieties. Fortunately the weather is fine
    and the sun glorious, and people here quickly forget all their
    griefs for the time being and then they brim over with high
    spirits and illusions.</p>

    <p>I have been re-reading Dickens's &ldquo;Christmas
    Books&rdquo; these days. There are things in them so profound
    that one must read them over and over, there are tremendously
    close connections with Carlyle.</p>

    <p>Roulin, though he is not quite old enough to be like a
    father to me, has all the same a silent gravity and tenderness
    for me such as an old soldier might have for a young one. All
    the time - but without a word - a something which seems to say,
    We do not know what will happen to us tomorrow, but whatever it
    may be, think of me. And it does one good when it comes from a
    man who is neither embittered, nor sad, nor perfect, nor happy,
    nor always irreproachably right. But such a good soul and so
    wise and so full of feeling and so trustful. I tell you I have
    no right to complain of anything whatever about Arles, when I
    think of some things I have seen there which I shall never be
    able to forget.</p>

    <p>It is getting late. Once more I wish you and Jo plenty of
    happiness, and a handshake in thought.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
