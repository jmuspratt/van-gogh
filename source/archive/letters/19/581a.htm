    <p>[Letter written by Signac to Theo]</p>

    <p>Dear Mr. Van Gogh,</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I found your brother in perfect health, physically and
    mentally.</label> Yesterday afternoon and again this morning we went
    for a walk together. He took me along to see his pictures, many
    of which are very good, and all of which are very curious.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.diet">His courteous doctor, the house physician Rey, is of the
    opinion that, if he should lead a very methodical life, eating
    and drinking normally and at regular hours, there would be
    every chance that the terrible crises would not repeat
    themselves at all.</label></p>

    <p>He is quite willing to keep him all the time that would be
    necessary. He thinks that all the expenses of his stay in the
    hospital will have to be defrayed by the municipality, because
    it was at the administration's demand that he was kept in the
    asylum.</p>

    <p>At any rate, if he does not go back to Paris, which in Mr.
    Rey's opinion would be preferable, it would be necessary for
    him to move to another house, as his neighbours are hostile to
    him. This is also what your brother desires, for at the
    earliest possible date he wants to leave this asylum, where
    after all he must necessarily suffer under the continual
    surveillance, which often has to be of a petty nature.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">Summarizing, I emphatically assure you that I found him in a
    condition of perfect health and sanity.</label> There is only one thing
    he wishes - to be able to work in tranquillity. So do your best
    to grant him this happiness. How dismal the life he is living
    must be for him.</p>

    <p>I shake your hand cordially, dear Mr. Van Gogh.</p>

    <p>P. Signac</p>

    <p>Letters to be called for at Cassis.</p>
