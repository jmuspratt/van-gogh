    and Artists), 1928 (1926 Issue, p. 451).]</p>

    <p>&ldquo;With friends of Van Gogh's in Arles&rdquo; (Memories
    of travels by Max Braumann).</p>

    <p>As he told Serret, who was to be his friend afterward, he
    only wanted to interrupt his journey in Arles for a short time.
    But the luminous sky of Provence would not release its hold on
    him, and so he decided to stay there, and to tackle the
    manifold problems that came rushing at him in this
    region....</p>

    <p>Serret (librarian of the Municipal Library) relates:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Vincent lives in my memory as an extremely timid man,
    a child. I was not interested in him because of his art,
    because I attached much value to his peculiar manner of
    painting, nor even perhaps because I had a perception of the
    leadership which it indicated. To me he was an unhappy man, who
    suffered much; and sufferings like these are only borne by
    noble characters. The outward life he led was of the most
    modest description.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Serret drew a picture of the extremely primitive way in
    which he prepared his food, and which was also described later
    by Dr. Rey. &ldquo;There can be no doubt that his body was
    perpetually undernourished, and this in conjunction with a
    productive energy intensified to a frenzy.&rdquo; Serret
    believes that the greater part of his mental perturbations were
    attributable to this excessive exploitation of his strength.
    &ldquo;Only one thing was important to him, his painting. But
    occasionally, when the consignments of paints sent by his
    brother Theo were used up, and he had no means of procuring new
    materials, he had to give up painting. Then a general dealer by
    the name of Durand, moved by his misery, took pity on him and
    gave him the paints...&rdquo;</p>

    <p>One of Serret's colleagues joined us, and contributed the
    observation: &ldquo;People did not like to associate with Van
    Gogh, as be was always hanging about in the brothels. I knew
    him too. He was my next-door neighbor, so to speak. Along with
    other young people I used to poke fun at this queer painter.
    Well, we were only children then. His appearance made a highly
    comical impression on us. His long smock, his gigantic hat, the
    man himself continually stopping and peering at things, excited
    our ridicule.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Serret continues: &ldquo;At the time, after Doctor Rey had
    taken care of him and nursed him, he wanted to show his
    gratitude in his own way. He painted Doctor Rey's portrait, and
    made him a present of it. However, the doctor thought it so
    lacking in beauty that he put it in the garret. It is said that
    there it took the place of a broken windowpane, serving the
    purpose of keeping out the drafts. Afterward a friend who
    discovered it in the garret got hold of it...&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Serret can say nothing about the circumstances under which
    Vincent left Arles at firsthand. The fact is that before that
    time he had gone on a world tour which lasted several years,
    and of which he gave a description - Serret is a writer - in a
    several-volume work. When he came back, the star of the dead
    painter had risen gloriously. Then, at his own expense, he had
    a memorial tablet put up in the front of the house where Van
    Gogh had worked and suffered, which tablet contains the simple
    words: &ldquo;The Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh lived in this
    house in 1887-1888 <i>[sic!]&rdquo; (Le peintre hollandais
    V.v.G. habita cette maison en 1887 - 1888)&hellip;</i></p>

    <p>At the appointed hour we, Professor Julius Seyler and I,
    called on Dr. Felix Rey. As his daughter had already told him
    what kind of information we wanted from him, he started talking
    without any circumlocution:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;First and foremost Vincent was a miserable, pitiful
    man, small of stature (please get up for a moment! about your
    size), lean. He always wore a sort of overcoat, smeared all
    over with colours - he painted with his thumb and then wiped it
    on his coat - and an enormous straw hat without a hatband, of
    the type usually worn by the shepherds of the Camargue as a
    protection against the scorching sun. He often used to complain
    of being the only painter in the region, so that he could not
    talk to anybody about painting. In the absence of any colleague
    he used to converse with me on the nature of the complementary
    colours. But for the life of me I could not understand that red
    should not be red, and green not green!&rdquo;...</p>

    <p>In exactly the same way as Serret, Dr. Rey now described how
    Vincent used to take his food. &ldquo;In the morning, before
    setting out to work with his easel and canvases, he would put a
    pot of chick peas on the coal fire. Then, when he came back,
    generally in the evening, dead tired and hungry, the fire had
    gone out, of course, and the mess of peas was usually only half
    done and in fact inedible. All the same, <label subject="health.gastrointestinal.stomach">he consumed the hardly
    inviting food, unless he preferred to drink spirits to relieve
    his stomach.&rdquo;</label></p>
