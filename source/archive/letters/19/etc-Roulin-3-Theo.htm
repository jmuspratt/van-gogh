    <p>Roulin 3 to Theo,</p>

    <p>3 January 1889</p>

    <p>Monsieur Gogh,</p>

    <p>I am happy to confirm the telegram I sent you today, in
    which I told you that my friend Vincent has completely
    recovered; he will leave the hospital one of these days to
    return to his house. Do not worry, he is better than before
    that unfortunate accident happened to him. At present he can
    move freely about the hospital; we walked for over an hour in
    the courtyard; he is in a very healthy state of mind. I do not
    know how to explain the severe measures that were taken to keep
    him from seeing his best friends.</p>
  </body>
