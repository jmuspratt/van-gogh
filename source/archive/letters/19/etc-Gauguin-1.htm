    <p>c. 7 - 9 September 1888</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I recieved your letter just when I was going to write you.
    Forgive me if I write so seldom and so little. I am terribly
    bored and I have stomach problems; we constantly have rain. I
    work and I don't do anything, in the sense that I draw with my
    hand, my head, and my heart with an eye toward what I want to
    do later. Yes, you're right to want painting with colouring
    suggestive of poetic ideas, and in this sense I agree with you,
    with one difference. I don't know any <i>poetic ideas</i>; it's
    probably a sense I'm lacking. I find <i>everything</i> poetic,
    and it's in the corners of my heart, which are sometimes
    mysterious, that I perceive poetry. Led harmoniously, forms and
    colours in themselves produce poetry. Without letting myself be
    surprised by the motif, I feel a sensation in front of someone
    else's painting that brings me to a poetic state, depending on
    the painter's intellectual forces, which emanate from it.
    Useless to go on about this, we'll talk at length about it
    another time. On this matter, I'm quite sad to be held here in
    Pont-Aven; each day my debts increase and make my trip more and
    more unlikely. What a long Calvary an artist's life is! And
    that's perhaps what makes us go on living. Passion gives life,
    and we die when it's no longer nourishing. Let's abandon these
    paths lined with thorny bushes, although they have their savage
    poetry&hellip;</p>

    <p>I study little Bernard, who I know less than you;
    I know that you want to do something good for him, and he needs it.
    He has naturally suffered, and he started life filled with gall, driven
    to see the bad side of man. I hope that, with his intelligence and his love
    of art he will one day perceive that goodness is a strength against the other,
    and a consolation for our own misfortunes. He likes you and values you,
    therefore you can have a good influence on him. We very much need to be
    united in heart and intelligence if we want the future to put us in our
    true places.</p>

    <p>Is your brother away on a journey? I don't have any news
    of him anymore.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Gauguin.</p>
