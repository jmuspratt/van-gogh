    <p>Arles, 2<sup>nd</sup> January 1889</p>

    <p>My Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>So as to reassure you completely on my account, I write to
    you these few lines in the office of the intern, M. Rey, whom
    you have yourself met. I shall stay here at the hospital for a
    few more days, then I think I can count on quietly returning to
    the house.</p>

    <p>Now I only beg of you one thing, not to worry, because that
    would cause me <i>too much</i> of a worry.</p>

    <p>Now, let's talk about our friend Gauguin, have I terrified
    him? In short, why hasn't he given me any sign of life? He must
    have left with you. Besides, he had a need to return to Paris,
    and in Paris perhaps, he will feel more at home than here. Tell
    Gauguin to write to me, and that I think about him all the
    time.</p>

    <p>A good handshake, I have read and re-read your letter about
    your meeting with the Bongers. It is perfect. As for me, I am
    content to stay just as I am.</p>

    <p>Again a good handshake to you and Gauguin.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Write to me still at the same address, Place Lamartine,
    2.</p>

    <p>[Added to this letter was a note from Dr. Rey]</p>

    <p>I add a few words to your brother's letter to reassure you,
    in my turn, on his account.</p>

    <p><label content="health.psychological">I am happy to tell you that my predictions have been
    realized and that this over-excitement has only been temporary.
    I strongly feel that he will be himself in a few days. I have
    made a point of his writing to you himself, to tell you in his
    own words his condition. I made him come down to my office to
    talk for a bit. It will entertain me and it will do him
    good.</label></p>

    <p>Please accept my kind regards, I am, yours very truly,</p>

    <p>Rey</p>
