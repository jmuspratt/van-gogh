  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Only a few words to tell you that my health and my work are
    not progressing so badly.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">It astonishes me already when I compare my condition today
    with what it was a month ago. Before that I knew well enough
    that one could fracture one's legs and arms and recover
    afterward, but I did not know that you could fracture the brain
    in your head and recover from that too.</label></p>

    <p>I still have a sort of &ldquo;what is the good of getting
    better?&rdquo; feeling about me, even in the astonishment
    aroused in me by my getting well, which I hadn't dared hope
    for.</p>

    <p>During your visit I think you must have noticed the<art id=0456> two size
    30</art> canvases <art id=0454>of sunflowers</art> in
    Gauguin's room. I have just put the finishing touches <art id=0455>to
    copies</art>, absolutely <art id=0458>identical replicas of them.</art>
    I think I have already told you that besides
    these I have <art id=0508>a canvas of &ldquo;La Berceuse&rdquo; the very one
    I was working on when my illness interrupted me</art>.
    I now have <art id=0505>two </art>versions <art id=0506>of this one too.</art></p>

    <p>I have just said to Gauguin about this picture that when he
    and I were talking about the fishermen of Iceland and of their
    mournful isolation, exposed to all dangers, alone on the sad
    sea - I have just said to Gauguin that following those intimate
    talks of ours the idea came to me to paint a picture in such a
    way that sailors, who are at once children and martyrs, seeing
    it in the cabin of their Icelandic fishing boat, would feel the
    old sense of being rocked come over them and remember their own
    lullabies.</p>

    <p>Now, it may be said that it is like a chromolithograph from
    a cheap shop. A woman in green with orange hair standing out
    against a background of green with pink flowers. Now these
    discordant sharps of crude pink, crude orange, and crude green
    are softened by flats of red and green.</p>

    <p>I picture to myself these same canvases between those of the
    sunflowers, which would thus form torches or candelabra beside
    them, the same size, and so the whole would be composed of
    seven or nine canvases.</p>

    <p>(I should like to make another duplicate for Holland if I
    could get hold of the model again.)</p>

    <p>Since it is still winter, look here, let me go quietly on
    with my work; if it is that of a madman, well, so much the
    worse. I can't help it.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.hallucinations">However, the unbearable hallucinations have ceased,
    and are now getting reduced to a simple nightmare, in consequence of my
    taking bromide of potassium, I think.</label></p>

    <p>It is still beyond my powers to go into the details of this
    money question, and yet I want to do that very thing, and I am
    furiously at work from morning till night, to prove to you
    (unless my work is another hallucination), to prove to you that
    indeed and indeed we are following Monticelli's track, and
    what's more, that we have a light before our feet and a lamp
    upon our path in the powerful work of Brias of Montpellier, who
    did so much to create a school in the South.</p>

    <p>Only don't be too amazed if during the next month I shall be
    obliged to ask you for the month's money in full and some extra
    money as well.</p>

    <p>After all it is only right that during periods of
    productivity, on which I spend all my vital warmth, I should
    insist on what is necessary in order to take a few
    precautions.</p>

    <p>Even in that case the difference in expenditure is certainly
    not excessive on my part.</p>

    <p>And once again, either shut me up in a madhouse right away -
    I shan't oppose it, for I may be deceiving myself - or else let
    me work with all my strength, while taking the precautions I
    speak of. If I am not mad, the time will come when I shall send
    you what I have promised you from the beginning. Now perhaps
    the pictures are alas bound to be dispersed, but when you for
    one see the whole that is in my mind, I dare hope it will make
    a comforting impression on you.</p>

    <p>You saw, as I did, part of the Faure collection being passed
    in review one by one in the little window of that picture
    framer's shop in the Rue Lafitte, didn't you? Like me, you saw
    that this slow succession of once despised canvases was
    strangely interesting.</p>

    <p>Good. My great desire would be that sooner or later you
    should have a series of canvases of mine which might likewise
    march past in just that same window.</p>

    <p>Now by continuing this furious work during next February and
    March, I shall hope to have finished the quietly composed
    repetitions of a number of studies I made last year. And these
    together with some canvases you have already had from me, such
    as <art id=0412>the &ldquo;Harvest&rdquo;</art> and <art id=0403>the
    &ldquo;White Orchard,&rdquo;</art> will form a
    tolerably firm foundation. By that same time, not later than
    March, that is, we can arrange what there is to arrange on the
    occasion of your marriage.</p>

    <p>But during February and March, though working, I shall go on
    considering myself an invalid, and I tell you beforehand that
    for those two months I shall perhaps have to take 250 a month
    from the year's allowance.</p>

    <p>You will perhaps understand that what would reassure me in
    some fashion as to my illness and the possibility of a relapse
    would be to see that Gauguin and I had not exhausted our brains
    for nothing, but that some good canvases have come out of
    it.</p>

    <p>And I dare to hope that someday you will see that by keeping
    steady and straight in this money business, in the longer run
    it will prove to be impossible that you have acted against the
    interests of the Goupils.</p>

    <p>But if I should have eaten their bread indirectly through
    you as an intermediary, in that case my integrity would be
    directly involved.</p>

    <p>Then, however, far from going on feeling more or less
    embarrassed by each other because of it, we shall be able to
    feel even more like brothers after that has been arranged.</p>

    <p>You will have gone on being poor all the time in order to
    support me, but I will give you back the money or give up the
    ghost. Meanwhile this tender-hearted wife of yours will have to
    come, and will make us old fellows almost young again.</p>

    <p>But this I believe, that you and I will have successors in
    our business, and that just as when the family, financially
    speaking, abandoned us to our own resources, once again it will
    be we who never flinched.</p>

    <p>And after that, the deluge&hellip; Am I wrong in this?
    Indeed, as long as this world lasts, so long will there be
    artists and picture dealers, especially those who, like you,
    are at the same time apostles.</p>

    <p>What I am telling you is true. If it is not absolutely
    necessary to shut me up in a cell, then I am still good for
    paying, at least in goods, what I am considered to owe. In
    conclusion, I still have to tell you that the chief
    superintendent of police paid me a very friendly visit
    yesterday. He told me as he shook hands that if I ever needed
    him, I could consult him as <i>a friend</i>. I am far from
    refusing that, and I may soon be in just that position if they
    raise difficulties about the house.</p>

    <p>I am waiting till the time comes for me to pay the month's
    rent to interview the agent or the proprietor face to face.</p>

    <p>But if they try to kick me out, they will find themselves
    tripped up this time anyhow.</p>

    <p>What would you? We have gone all out for the impressionists,
    and now as far as it's in my power I am trying to finish
    canvases which will undoubtedly secure me the little corner
    that I have claimed. Ah, the future of it all&hellip;but since
    old Pangloss assures us that everything is always for the best
    in the best of worlds - can we doubt it?</p>

    <p>My letter has grown longer than I intended, but it doesn't
    matter. The main thing is that I am asking categorically for
    two month's work before making the arrangements which will have
    to be made at the time of your marriage.</p>

    <p>After that, in the spring, you and your wife will found a
    commercial house for several generations. It will not be too
    easy. And that settled, I only ask the position of a painting
    employee, at least as long as there is enough to pay one.</p>

    <p>The work distracts my mind. And I <i>must</i> have some
    distraction. Yesterday I went to the Folies Arl&eacute;siennes,
    the budding theatre here. <label content="psychology.nightmares">It was the first time that
    I slept without a bad nightmare. </label>They were giving (it was a
    Proven&ccedil;al literary society) what they called a
    <i>No&euml;l</i> or <i>Pastorale</i>, reminiscent of the Middle
    Ages. It was a very carefully studied performance, and must
    have cost them a lot of money.</p>

    <p>It represented, of course, the birth of Christ, mixed up
    with the burlesque of a family of gaping Proven&ccedil;al
    peasants.</p>

    <p>But the amazing thing about it, like a Rembrandt etching,
    was the old peasant woman, just such another as Mme. Tanguy,
    with a head of silex or flint, dishonest, treacherous, silly,
    all this very evident from the preceding scenes.</p>

    <p>Now in the play that woman, led before the mystic crib,
    began to sing in her quavering voice, and then the voice
    changed, changed from the voice of a witch to that of an angel,
    and from an angel's voice to a child's, and then the answer
    came in another voice, strong and warm and vibrant, the voice
    of a woman behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>It was amazing. I can tell you these so-called
    &ldquo;F&eacute;libres&rdquo; had certainly put themselves to
    expense.</p>

    <p>As for me, being in this little country of mine, I have no
    need at all to go to the tropics. I believe and I shall always
    believe in the art that is to be created in the tropics, and I
    think it will be marvellous, but personally I am too old and
    (especially if I have a papier m&acirc;ch&eacute; ear put on)
    too jerry-built to go there.</p>

    <p>Will Gauguin do it? It is not essential. For if this ought
    to be done, it will happen of itself.</p>

    <p>We are nothing but links in a chain.</p>

    <p>Old Gauguin and I understand each other basically, and if we
    are a bit mad, what of it? Aren't we also thoroughly artists
    enough to contradict suspicions on that score by what we say
    with our brush?</p>

    <p>Perhaps someday everyone will have neurosis, St. Vitus'
    dance, or something else.</p>

    <p>But doesn't the antidote exist? In Delacroix, in Berlioz,
    and Wagner? And really, as for the artist's madness of all the
    rest of us, I do not say that I especially am not infected
    through and through, but I say and will maintain that our
    antidotes and consolations may, with a little good will, be
    considered ample compensation.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
