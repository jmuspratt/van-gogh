    <p>Letter T 6<br>
     Paris, 2 May 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter, which shows us that at least
    your physical strength leaves nothing to be desired, seeing
    that you say you have too much of it; however, this is
    something you should not rely on; <i>feeling</i> one's strength
    does not mean having much of it; but if it is really true, all
    the better. Now there is one thing in your letter which I
    entirely disapprove of, and I am going to tell you what it is,
    and after that you may do what you like. I mean your plans to
    join the Foreign Legion. <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>It is meant as an act of despair, isn't it? For I don't
    think you have developed a taste for that profession
    spontaneously. The fact is that you can do no painting at the
    moment; that you are in a state of convalescence, and this fact
    has given you the idea that you will never be able to paint
    again, and so you tell yourself that three months of being
    taken care of without being able to work cost money and don't
    bring any in. But you forget that, suppose they let you work
    when you are a soldier, you will be kept like a boy in a
    boarding school, and that, if you are already afraid of the
    supervision of an establishment like the one at St.
    R&eacute;my, you will have a great deal more to fear from
    the practices of military life. Viewed as a whole, this idea is
    born of an exaggerated dread and causing me expense and worry,
    and you consequently bother your head unnecessarily. Last year
    was not a bad one for me as far as money is concerned, so you
    may count on what I sent you before without any scruple and
    without fear of causing me trouble. If it is not repulsive to
    you to go to St. R&eacute;my, say for only a month, you
    will be examined by medical specialists, and you will probably
    be able to profit by their advice.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the director of the establishment at St.
    R&eacute;my tells me in a letter he wrote me that he will
    not pledge himself to anything with reference to allowing you
    to go out before he has examined you, but I suppose that after
    he has seen you, there will be no doubt about his leaving you
    free to go out in order to work.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">As for me, I attribute a large part of your disease to the
    fact that your material existence has been too neglected. In an
    establishment like the one at St. R&eacute;my there will
    be approximately the same regularity in the mealtimes and so
    on, and I think this regularity will do you no harm - on the
    contrary. Now if you should prefer, we might try to get
    information about the establishment at Aix or Marseilles in
    order to see whether they make other conditions there.</label> What you
    ought to know is that from one point of view you are not to be
    pitied, though it may not seem so.</p>

    <p>How many are there who would be glad of having done the work
    you have accomplished; what more do you ask; wasn't it your
    cherished wish to create something, and if it was granted you
    to make what you have made, then why do you despair that a time
    will come when you will do good work again? However bad society
    may be at present, there are still ways of living in it;
    witness Puvis de Chavannes, Degas, and others. I feel sure that
    if you have the will, you'll be able to take up your work again
    very soon. For all that don't think that I am without fellow
    feeling for your disillusionment when, for example, you went
    back to your studio and found it all moldy because of the
    moisture.</p>

    <p>Yet be of good heart; your disasters will surely come to an
    end.</p>

    <p>The kindest regards from my wife, who is in good health. She
    is getting quite accustomed to the house. A hearty
    handshake.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>
