    <p>Letter T 4<br>
     Paris, 16 March 1889<sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>I hear that you are not better yet, which causes me a good
    deal of grief. I so wish you could tell me how you are feeling,
    for there is nothing more distressing than this uncertainty,
    and if you could tell me how things are with you, I might be
    able to do something sooner to give you solace. You have done
    so much for me that it is a great sorrow for me to know that,
    precisely at this time when in all probability I am going to
    have days of happiness with my dear Jo, you are passing through
    days of misery. She had the fond idea that, by reason of her
    wanting to live my life as much as possible, you might have
    been a brother to her, as you have always been to me. We hope
    from the bottom of our hearts that you will be able to recover
    your health completely, and that you will be able to resume
    your work within a short time.</p>

    <p>While arranging my new apartment it is such a pleasure for
    me to look at your pictures. They make the rooms so gay, and
    there is such an intensity of truth, of the true countryside in
    them, in each one of them. It is really as you used to say now
    and then of certain pictures of other artists - that they give
    the impression of having been reaped directly from the
    fields.</p>

    <p>If it were not so far away, I should certainly have come to
    see you, but I don't have the time for that, and I ask myself
    if my visit would be of any use to you.</p>

    <p>Signac intends to go to the South within a short time. He
    will go see you. I am now having an exhibition of Claude Monet
    at the gallery; it is very successful. It will not be long
    before the public will be asking for pictures of the new
    school, for they certainly stir up the public mind. If you can,
    you would be most kind if you would give me, or let someone
    give me, news about you, for apart from the letters from
    Messrs. Rey and Salles, I know nothing about you.</p>

    <p>I wish you better health, and remain your brother who loves
    you.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>
