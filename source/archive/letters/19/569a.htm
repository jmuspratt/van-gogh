  <body>
    <p>Dear Mother and Sister,</p>

    <p>For several weeks already I have firmly intended to write
    you a word or two to wish you a truly prosperous and Happy New
    Year. Well, I am pretty late in doing this.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I think you may feel inclined to excuse me if I tell you
    that in December I was indisposed.</p>

    <p>But at the same time I can inform you that I have completely
    recovered, and am at work again, and everything is normal.</label></p>

    <p>Although it is winter here too, and, what is worse, part of
    the country is flooded, at times we have a good deal milder
    weather than you do in Holland. Be so kind as to take good note
    of the fact that I am writing you these few words, in case Theo
    has told you about my having been indisposed for a while.
    However, I hope he understood of his own accord that it was not
    worth troubling to inform you of it.</p>

    <p>But so that there may be no worrying on your part, nor even
    any question of it, I am writing you myself.</p>

    <p>For this very reason I have postponed answering Jet Mauve's
    letter, which, however, I hope to do shortly; and at the same
    time I thank Wil kindly for her last letter.</p>

    <p>My having been unwell has provided the opportunity for
    getting acquainted with quite a number of people, and I think
    it's probable that I shall have to do a number of
    portraits.</p>

    <p>I so much hope everything is all right with you all,
    especially your health. As for myself, my having been
    indisposed for a few days has in fact refreshed me
    considerably, and I think there is a chance that there will be
    nothing the matter with me for a long time to come.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile I shall be very pleased to get a letter from you
    one of these days. Although it is still rather a thing of the
    future, I suppose you are often thinking of Theo's intended
    visit to you. I should not be greatly surprised if he went a
    little earlier than usual this year, that is <i>before</i> the
    exhibition instead of after.</p>

    <p>But all the same he will have to act according to
    circumstances.</p>

    <p>I could not help thinking of you rather often these days, be
    assured of that, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours lovingly, Vincent</p>
  </body>
