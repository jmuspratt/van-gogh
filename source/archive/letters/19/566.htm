    <p>[Written in pencil]</p>

    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>I hope that Gauguin will completely reassure you, and a bit
    about the painting business too.</p>

    <p>I expect to begin work again soon.</p>

    <p>The charwoman and my friend Roulin had taken care of the
    house, and have put everything in order.</p>

    <p>When I come out I shall be able to take my little road here
    again, and soon the fine weather will be coming and I shall
    recommence on the orchards in bloom.</p>

    <p>My dear brother, I am so terribly <i>distressed</i> at your
    journey. I should have wished you had been spared that, for
    after all no harm came to me, and there was no reason why you
    should put yourself to that trouble.</p>

    <p>I cannot tell you how glad I am that you have made peace,
    and even more than that, with the Bongers.</p>

    <p>Say that to Andr&eacute; from me, and give him a very cordial
    handshake from me.</p>

    <p>What would I not have given for you to have seen Arles when
    it was fine, as it is you have seen it in black [looking
    dismal].</p>

    <p>However, keep good heart, address letters direct to me at
    Place Lamartine 2. I will send Gauguin's pictures that are
    still at the house as soon as he wishes. We owe him the money
    that he spent on the furniture.</p>

    <p>A handshake, I must go back to hospital, but shall soon be
    out for good.</p>

    <p>Yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Write a line to Mother too for me, so that no-one will be
    worried.</p>

    <p>Written on the back:</p>

    <p>My dear friend Gauguin, I take the opportunity of my first
    outing from the hospital to write you a couple of words of my
    profound and sincere friendship.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I have often thought of you in the hospital and even in full
    fever and relative weakness.</label></p>

    <p>Tell me - was my brother Theo's
    trip necessary - my friend?</p>

    <p>Now, at least, completely reassure everyone, and I pray you
    yourself to have confidence that, all in all, nothing bad
    exists in this best of worlds where everything is always for
    the best.</p>

    <p>Then, I would like you to give my kind regards to the good
    Schoeffenecker [Schuffenecker], that you refrain until more mature reflection on
    both our parts, from speaking ill of our poor little yellow
    house, that you give my respects to the painters that I saw in
    Paris.</p>

    <p>I wish you prosperity in Paris, with a good
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Roulin has been truly good to me, it is he who had had the
    presence of mind to make me get out of there before the others
    were convinced.</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin] Please reply soon.</p>
