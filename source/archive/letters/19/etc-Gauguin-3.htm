    <p>[Letter from Gauguin to Theo]</p>

    <p>My dear M. Van Gogh,</p>

    <p>I feel somewhat hesitant to respond to your letter. Should I
    answer to Van Gogh the art dealer or to Van Gogh Vincent's
    friend and brother? It's easy in words, more difficult by
    letter - however, I have to talk. But frankly speaking, I have
    to stop for a moment before I decide to answer the friend and
    thus express all my thoughts. For a month, I have been going
    over with de Haan the many facets of the tempest which arose
    over my latest paintings.</p>

    <p>Everything has a beginning for want of an end. Are you
    listening directly to me, Van Gogh, with your mind and your
    heart?</p>

    <p>This summer we created a distinct trend which was badly
    established but was given exposure, the art of Bernard and me
    with some followers. Be assured, Degas and others understood it
    well. There is a wolf in the fold! Impressionist, Synthetist,
    symbolic, all in <i>ist</i> and <i>ic</i>, etc. Well then, is
    art locked up in each period in the thoughts of a few, the
    powerful, with <i>their methods</i> - or else is it a direct
    personal emanation to come from the thoughts of those in
    existence? Those who suffered because they didn't follow the
    norm were enraged that the powerful ones at the Ecole did not
    want to understand them. Today they are somewhat satisfied, and
    they want to be the authority that is doing the injustice to
    others that had been done to them and about which they
    complain. Petty humanity.</p>

    <p>Well then, we young people ourselves are seeking and will
    always seek. So down with them. Those are my exact thoughts
    from the point of <i>departure</i>. It has been said - they
    will want to walk in a path that is not ours, well then, we are
    waiting for them; we will see if they are strong enough.</p>

    <p>Today you seem to feel that my latest works are stronger
    than my previous ones. Be logical and draw the conclusion -
    that the artist has not lowered himself and has worked more for
    <i>art</i> than for <i>his business</i>. New quests are more
    useful to the new generation than no searching at all; since
    what has been done was done more <i>forcefully</i> than
    anything modern. A Dutchman says that I resemble Bernard this
    year. I don't resemble him more than he resembles me, but we
    both are doing <i>different</i> research toward the same goal.
    A goal about which I have been thinking for a long time but
    which I have only recently formulated. I must sleep, this
    Dutchman says, but in sleep there is dreaming and you don't
    want dreaming. One does not yet know his God, adds the same
    Dutchman. But I don't know him yet myself: being infinite, my
    entire life isn't enough to arrive there to find him, to define
    him. He is the complete opposite of Degas, continues this
    friendly Dutchman. And why not! If one want to make art then
    one must be of the same opinion as Degas, as strong as he
    is.</p>

    <p>He also writes to his friend de Haan before leaving for the
    Transvaal. Gauguin will do you wrong and you do the same for
    him. My God, what does all that mean? Forget it.</p>

    <p>Now to enlighten you, my dear M. Van Gogh, I am going to
    give you an insight into my paintings. Examine them carefully,
    the wood at the same time as the ceramics. You will see that
    all this holds together. I am searching for and at the same
    time expressing a general state of mind rather than a unique
    thought, to have someone else's eye experience an indefinite,
    infinite impression. To suggest a suffering does not indicate
    what kind of suffering: purity in general and not what kind of
    purity. Literature is one (painting also). Consequently,
    suggested and not explained thought.</p>

    <p>You ask me, or rather you tell me, that people do not at all
    understand the work I do in wood. It is, however, simple. There
    is a nude of a woman, a man, a fox, and an inscription. That is
    all! [Gauguin is referring here to his `Be in Love and You will
    be Happy', Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.]</p>

    <p>Since you want literature, I am going to give you some (for
    you only).</p>

    <p>At the top the rotting city of Babylon. At the bottom, as
    though through a window, a view of fields, nature, with its
    flowers. Simple woman, whom a demon takes by the hand, who
    struggles despite the good advice of the tempting inscription.
    A fox (symbol of perversity among Indians). Several figures in
    this entourage who express the opposite of the advice
    (&ldquo;you will be happy&rdquo;), to show that it is
    fallacious. For those who want literature, there it is. But it
    is not for examination. The background of all this is
    sculptural art of <i>bas-relief</i> forms and colours in the
    expression of the material. Between the <i>possible</i> and the
    <i>impossible</i>. The same for the painting of the three women
    of stone holding Christ.</p>

    <p>Brittany, simple superstition and desolation.</p>

    <p>The hill is guarded by a line of cows arranged up the hill.
    My intention in this painting is that everything should breathe
    passive belief, suffering, primitive religious style, and great
    nature with its cry. It's wrong of me not to be strong enough
    to express it better - but I am not wrong <i>to think
    it.</i></p>

    <p>Moreover, the rest of us poor devils without lodgings,
    without models, we resemble virtuosos who play in a
    caf&eacute; on a tin-kettle piano. But Degas, he plays in
    complete silence, surrounded by brilliant company on an Erard
    piano.</p>

    <p>It is good to meticulously touch up the model from nature,
    but be careful lest you smell its odour.</p>

    <p>I think I said (in telegraph style) what I wanted to say,
    perhaps with bitterness - you have to admit that there is
    reason - but from the depths of my heart and without any
    misunderstanding with you. You know that I have an Indian -
    Inca - background, and everything I do is affected by it. It is
    the depth of my personality. To rotten civilization, I aim to
    oppose something more natural, beginning with savageness. I
    would need a lot of time and ink to explain my painting to you,
    but I hope, however, that you will feel its uncertainty with
    this letter.</p>

    <p>You would like to see the grey and lugubrious sea of Le
    Poldu with us! Yes they evoke, in contrast, very nice visions.
    I will <i>also take you to the visions evoked</i>. And for
    these visions evoked, doesn't one feel an instinctive modesty
    to show them only <i>veiled</i>?</p>

    <p>De Haan the disciple meditates at the window with me, and he
    who has not breathed any other air than those of the bedroom
    finds this harsh aspect of the great, hardly Parisian sea to be
    grandiose. What a powerful and sad voice. He sends you his
    regards and will write soon.</p>

    <p>Now let's talk business. Schuff [enecker] found a buyer for
    a 30-franc pastel. The buyer is not rich; I gave it away, but
    it doesn't matter - a more flattering than productive
    affair.</p>

    <p>The price of my work in wood. I'm scratching my head. I do
    not evaluate its artistic value. But the work of a craftsman
    and the costs of wood shipment, etc. If I ask 2,000 francs,
    that's nothing for it, and de Haan agrees with me. And the
    buyers will scream that it's expensive. On this, do what you
    can. Poor devil - I have nothing to say and am obliged to be
    content with a glance. Look, Van Gogh, you see it like I do (it
    is impossible for me to continue the struggle as an artist) or
    to smile at the public with professional paintings - (and that
    I cannot do). The most dignified thing for a good-hearted man
    to do is what I asked you to do. To leave for Tonkin and I ask
    you to please speak about it especially to Manet.</p>

    <p>Do you have any better news from Vincent? I am sorry that he
    can't be there near you sometimes, in order to guide a bit in
    painting. You hear too many different voices. A painter,
    myself, and stubborn, I would be confused.</p>

    <p>Follow your first impression; it will be better than
    contradictory reasonings of people who have a calculated
    interest.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Gauguin</p>
