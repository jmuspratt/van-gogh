  <body>
    <p>My dear friend Gauguin,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter. Left behind alone on board my
    little yellow house - as it was perhaps my duty anyway to be
    the last to leave - I am not a little put out at my friends'
    departure.</p>

    <p>Roulin got his transfer to Marseilles and has just left. It
    has been touching to see him these last few days with little
    Marcelle, making her laugh and dandling her on his knee.</p>

    <p>His transfer means his being separated from his family, and
    you will not be surprised that the man whom you and I one
    evening nicknamed &ldquo;the passer-by,&rdquo; was very
    heavy-hearted. And so was I, on witnessing that and other
    upsetting things.</p>

    <p>When he sang to his child, his voice took on a strange
    timbre in which one could hear the voice of a woman rocking a
    cradle or of a sorrowing wet-nurse, and then another trumpet
    sound like a clarion call to France.</p>

    <p>I reproach myself now that it was I - perhaps insisting too
    much that you stay on here to await events and giving you so
    many good reasons for doing so - I reproach myself now that
    perhaps it was I who was the cause of your departure - unless,
    of course, that departure was planned beforehand? And that it
    was therefore perhaps up to me to show I still had the right to
    be kept fully in the picture.</p>

    <p>Be that as it may, I hope we still like each other enough to
    be able, if need be, to start afresh, assuming that the wolf at
    the door, alas ever-present for those of us artists without
    means, should necessitate such a measure.</p>

    <p>You mention a canvas of mine in your letter - <art id=0454>Sunflowers on
    a yellow background</art> - and make it plain you'd rather like to
    have it. I don't think it's altogether a bad choice - for if
    Jeannin can claim the peony, and Quost the hollyhock, then
    surely I, above all others, can lay claim to the sunflower.</p>

    <p>I think I'll begin by returning what is yours [Gauguin's
    fencing equipment], while observing that it is my intention,
    after what has happened, categorically to deny your right to
    the canvas in question. But since I commend your intelligence
    in choosing this canvas, I'll make the effort to paint two of
    them exactly alike. In which case it can all be done and
    settled amicably so that you can have your own in the end all
    the same.</p>

    <p>I made a fresh start today on <art id=0508>my canvas of Mme. Roulin</art>, the one in which,
    due to my accident, the hands
    had been left unfinished. As an arrangement of colours, the
    reds moving through to pure orange, building up again in the
    flesh tones to the chromes, passing through the pinks and
    blending with the olive and malachite greens - as an
    impressionist arrangement of colours I have never devised
    anything better. And I'm sure that if one were to put this
    canvas just as it is in a fishing boat, even one from Iceland,
    there would be some among the fishermen who would feel they
    were there, inside the cradle.</p>

    <p>Ah! My dear friend, to achieve in painting what the music of
    Berlioz and Wagner has already done &hellip; an art that offers
    consolation for the broken-hearted! There are still just a few
    who feel it as you and I do!!!</p>

    <p>My brother understands you well and when he tells me that
    you are a poor sort of wretch like me, well, that just proves
    that he understands us.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I shall send you your things, but I still have bouts of
    weakness at times during which I'm in no position to even lift
    a finger to return your things to you. In a few days' time I'll
    pluck up the courage. And as for the `fencing masks and gloves'
    (make as little use as possible of less infantile engines of
    war), these terrible engines of war will just have to wait
    until then. I am writing to you very calmly, but packing up
    what's left is still beyond me.</p>

    <p>In my mental or nervous fever, or madness - I am not too
    sure how to put it or what to call it - my thoughts sailed over
    many seas.</label></p>
