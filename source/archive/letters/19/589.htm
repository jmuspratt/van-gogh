  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have sent off two cases of canvases recently, D 58 and
    59, by goods train, and it will be at least a week or so before
    you get them. There are lots of daubs among them, which you
    will have to destroy, but I have sent them, such as they are,
    so that you will be able to keep what seems passable to you. I
    have put in some fencing masks and some studies of Gauguin's
    and the book by Lemonnier.</p>

    <p>Having taken the precaution of paying 30 francs in advance
    to the manager, I am naturally here still, but they cannot keep
    me indefinitely and it is more than time to decide. Bear in
    mind that shutting me up in an asylum will be expensive in the
    long run, though probably less so than taking a house again;
    <label content="feelings.loneliness">besides, the thought of beginning to live alone again is an
    absolute horror to me.</label></p>

    <p>I should like to enlist. What I am afraid of is - as my
    accident is known all over town here - that they would refuse
    me, but the thing I dread, or rather the thing that makes me
    faint-hearted, is the possibility, the probability of a refusal
    here. If I had some acquaintance who could shove me into the
    Legion for five years, I should go.</p>

    <p>Only I do not want this to be thought a fresh act of madness
    on my part, and that is why I speak of it to you, as well as to
    M. Salles, so that if I did go, it would be in all serenity and
    after mature consideration.</p>

    <p>For bear in mind, to go on spending money on this painting
    when things might come to such a pitch that you would be short
    of money for your own housekeeping would be atrocious, and you
    know well that the chances of success are abominable. Besides,
    I am so convinced that it is an irresistible <i>force
    majeure</i> that has frustrated me. Moreover, in the future
    there might possibly be our sister to be provided for.</p>

    <p>Possibly, I say, but however this may be, if I knew I'd be
    accepted, I'd join the Legion. The thing is I have become timid
    and hesitant since I have been living like a machine.</p>

    <p>However, my health is very good and I am working a little. I
    am doing <art id=0517>an avenue of pink flowering chestnuts and a little
    cherry tree in flower and a wisteria plant and a path in the
    park splashed with light and shade.</art></p>

    <p>This will make a pendant to the garden which is in the
    walnut frame.</p>

    <p>If I talk about enlisting for five years, don't go thinking
    that I am doing this with the idea of sacrificing myself or of
    doing a good deed.</p>

    <p>I have been &ldquo;in a hole&rdquo; all my life, and my
    mental condition is not only vague <i>now</i>, but <i>has
    always been so</i>, so that whatever is done for me, I
    <i>cannot</i> think things out so as to balance my life. Where
    I <i>have</i> to follow a rule, as here in the hospital, I feel
    at peace. And it would be more or less the same thing if I were
    in the army.<label content="health.mental"> Now if I certainly run a great risk here of being
    refused because they know that I am a madman or an epileptic
    probably for good (though according to what I have heard, there
    are 50,000 epileptics in France, only 4,000 of whom are
    confined<b>,</b> and so it is not extraordinary),</label> perhaps I
    should soon be provided for after speaking, for instance, to
    D&eacute;taille or Caran d'Ache in Paris. This idea would
    really be no wilder than any other, so let's think it over, but
    think in order to act. Meanwhile I am doing what I can and I
    have good will enough for any kind of work, it <i>does not
    matter what</i>, painting included.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">But the money painting costs crushes me with a feeling of
    debt and worthlessness, and it would be a good thing if it were
    possible that this should stop.</label></p>

    <p>Besides, I have said once and for all, if at present there
    is a decision to be made, it is better that you and M. Salles
    should make it for me. And mind, I shan't say No to anything,
    not even to going to St. R&eacute;my, in spite of the
    obstacles of higher terms than we had hoped for, and of not
    having full liberty to go outside to paint. We really must
    decide, because they cannot keep me here indefinitely.</p>

    <p>I told the manager that I'd be glad to pay them 60 francs,
    for instance, instead of 45 if I could stay here
    indefinitely.</p>

    <p>But their terms are fixed, it appears.</p>

    <p>So although up till now nobody has said anything to me, I
    think it would be right to go. I might go and stay again at the
    night caf&eacute;, where I have stored my furniture,
    but...I should be in daily contact there with the very people
    who used to be my neighbours, for it is next door to the house
    where I had my studio.</p>

    <p>However, nobody says anything to me now in town, and I
    actually paint in the public garden without being much bothered
    by anything but the curiosity of passers-by.</p>

    <p>I have reread the article on Monet in Figaro and I like it
    much better than at first.</p>

    <p>Don't let's lose heart too much over material things, but at
    least try to be sensible about them. It is to the good that
    <i>if necessary</i> I can go and lodge in the night
    caf&eacute; here and even board here, for the people
    there are friends of mine, naturally enough, since I have been
    and am one of their customers. It has been very hot today and
    that always does me good. I have worked with more spirit than I
    have yet had.</p>

    <p>With a good handshake for you and also for your wife.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
