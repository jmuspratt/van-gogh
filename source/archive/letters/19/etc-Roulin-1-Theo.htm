  <body>
    <p>Arles, 26<sup>th</sup> December 1888</p>

    <p>Monsieur Gogh,</p>

    <p>I have been to see your brother Vincent.<label content="health.mental"> I promised to tell
    you what I thought of him. I am sorry to tell you that I think
    he is lost. Not only is his mind affected, but also he is very
    weak and despondent.</label> He recognized me but did not show any
    pleasure at seeing me and didn't ask about any member of my
    family nor anyone else that he knows. When I left him I told
    him that I would come back to see him; he replied that we would
    meet again in heaven, and from his manner I understand that he
    was saying a prayer. From what the porter told me, I think that
    they are taking the necessary steps to have him placed in a
    mental hospital.</p>

    <p>Please accept, Monsieur, the greetings of him who calls
    himself the friend of your beloved brother.</p>

    <p>Roulin, Joseph.</p>

    <p>Entrepeneur des Postes</p>

    <p>Rue de la Montagne du Cordes, 10</p>

    <p>Arles sur Rhone</p>

    <p>My family sends their greetings to M. Paul Gauguin.</p>
