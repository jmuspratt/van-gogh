  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You will probably be back in Paris at the moment when this
    letter arrives. I wish you and your wife a great deal of
    happiness. Thank you very much for your kind letter and for the
    100-franc note it contained.</p>

    <p>Out of the 65 francs which I owe, I have paid only 25 francs
    to my landlord, having had to pay three months' rent in advance
    for a room which I shan't be living in, but where I have sent
    my furniture, and having besides had expenses of 10 francs or
    so for moving, etc.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">Then as my clothes were not in too brilliant a condition and
    I had to have something new to go out in the street in, I got a
    suit for 35 francs and spent 4 francs on six pairs of socks.</label> So
    out of the note I have only a few francs left, and at the end
    of the month I must pay the landlord again, though he might be
    kept waiting for a few days.</p>

    <p>I settled my bill at the hospital today, and there is still
    almost enough for the rest of the month out of the money I
    still have on deposit. At the end of the month I should like to
    go to the hospital in St. R&eacute;my, or another
    institution of this kind, of which M. Salles has told me.
    Forgive me if I don't go into details and argue the pros and
    cons of such a step.</p>

    <p>Talking about it would be mental torture.</p>

    <p>It will be enough, I hope, if I tell you that I feel quite
    unable to take a new studio and to stay there alone - here in
    Arles or elsewhere, for the moment it is all the same; I have
    tried to make up my mind to begin again, but at the moment it's
    not possible.</p>

    <p>I should be afraid of losing the power to work, which is
    coming back to me now, by forcing myself and by having all the
    other responsibilities of a studio on my shoulders besides.</p>

    <p>And temporarily I wish to remain shut up as much for my own
    peace of mind as for other people's. What comforts me a little
    is that I am beginning to consider madness as a disease like
    any other and accept the thing as such, whereas during the
    crises themselves I thought that everything I imagined was
    real. Anyway, the fact is that I do not want to think or talk
    about it. You'll spare me any explanations, but I ask you and
    Messrs. Salles and Rey to arrange things so that I can go there
    as a resident boarder at the end of this month or the beginning
    of May.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.reclusive">Beginning again that painter's life I have been living,
    isolated in the studio so often, and without any other means of
    distraction than going to a caf&eacute; or a restaurant
    with all the neighbors criticizing, etc., <i>I
    can't face it</i>; going to live with another
    person, say another artist - difficult, very difficult - it's
    taking too much responsibility on oneself. I dare not even
    think of it.</label></p>

    <p>So let's try it three months to begin with, and afterward we
    shall see. Now one's board ought to be about 80 francs, and I
    shall do a little painting and drawing without putting such
    frenzy into it as a year ago. Do not be grieved at all this.
    Certainly these last days were sad, with all the moving, taking
    away all my furniture, packing up the canvases that are going
    to you, but the thing I felt saddest about was that you had
    given me all these things with such brotherly love, and that
    for so many years you were always the one who supported me, and
    then to be obliged to come back and tell you this sorry tale -
    but it's difficult to express it as I felt it. The goodness you
    have shown me is not lost, because you had it and it remains
    for you; even if the material results should be nil, it remains
    for you all the more; but I can't say it as I felt it.
    <label content="food-and-drink.alcohol">Meanwhile you do understand that if alcohol has undoubtedly
    been one of the great causes of my madness, then it came on
    very slowly and will go away slowly too, assuming it does go,
    of course. Or the same thing if it comes from smoking. But I
    should only hope that it - this recovery [probably a word has
    been omitted here] the frightful superstition of some people on
    the subject of alcohol, so that they prevail upon themselves
    never to drink or smoke.</label></p>

    <p>We are already ordered not to lie or steal, etc., and not to
    commit other crimes great or small and it would become too
    complicated if it was absolutely indispensable to have nothing
    but virtues in the society in which we are very undeniably
    planted, whether it be good or bad.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I assure you that during those queer days when many things
    seem odd to me because my brain is agitated, through it all I
    don't dislike old Pangloss.</label></p>

    <p>But you would do me a service by discussing the question
    frankly with M. Salles and M. Rey.</p>

    <p>I should think that with an allowance of 75 francs or so a
    month there must be a way of interning me so that should have
    everything I need.</p>

    <p>Then, if it is possible, I'd very much like to be able to go
    out in the daytime and draw or paint outside. Seeing that I go
    out every day now here, and think that this could continue.</p>

    <p>Paying more, I warn you, would make me less happy. The
    company of other patients, you understand, is not at all
    disagreeable to me; on the contrary, it distracts me.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.alcohol">Ordinary food suits me quite well, especially if
    they gave me a little more wine there, as they do here usually a
    half-liter instead of a quarter for instance.</label></p>

    <p>But a private room - it remains to be seen what the
    arrangements of an institution like that would be. Mind you Rey
    is overburdened with work, overburdened. If he writes to you,
    or M. Salles, better do exactly what they say. After all we
    must take our share, my boy, of the diseases of our time - in a
    way it is only fair after all that, having lived some years in
    comparatively good health, we should have our share sooner or
    later. As for me, you know well enough that I should not
    exactly have chosen madness if I had had a choice, but once you
    have an affliction of that sort, you can't catch it again. And
    there'll perhaps be the consolation of being able to go on
    working a bit at painting.</p>

    <p>How will you manage not to speak too well or too ill of
    Paris and many other things to your wife? Do you feel in
    advance that you will be quite capable of keeping exactly the
    golden mean all the time and from all points of view?</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I shake your hand in thought. I do not know if I shall write
    very, very often because not all my days are clear enough for
    me to write fairly logically,</label> All your kindness to me seemed
    greater than ever to me today. I can't put the way I feel it in
    words, but I assure you that this kindness has been pure gold,
    and if you do not see any results from it, my dear brother,
    don't fret about it; your own goodness abides. Only transfer
    this affection to your wife as much as possible. And if we
    correspond somewhat less, you will see that if she is what I
    think her, she will comfort you. That is what I hope.</p>

    <p>Rey is a very nice fellow, a tremendous worker, always on
    the job. What men the modern doctors are! If you see Gauguin or
    write to him, remember me to him.</p>

    <p>I shall be very glad to hear any news you can give me of our
    mother and sister, and if they are well; tell them to look upon
    this affair of mine - I mean it - as nothing to be inordinately
    distressed about, because I may be comparatively unfortunate,
    but after all, in spite of that, I may still have some almost
    normal years before me. It is a disease like any other, and now
    almost everyone we know among our friends has something the
    matter with him. So is it worth talking about? I am sorry to
    give trouble to M. Salles, and Rey, and above all to you too,
    but what is one to do? My head isn't steady enough to begin
    again as before - then the important thing is not to cause any
    more scenes in public, and naturally, being a little calmer
    now, <label content="health.general">I distinctly feel that I was mentally and physically in an
    unhealthy condition.</label> And then people have been kind, those I
    remember, and as for the others, after all I caused some
    uneasiness, and if I had been in a normal condition, things
    would never have happened the way they did.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, write when you can.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
