    <p>Letter 583b<br>
     Arles, c. 10 April 1889</p>

    <p>My dear friend Signac,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your postcard and the information it
    contained. As to my brother's not having replied to your
    letter, I am inclined to think that it is hardly his fault. I
    myself have not heard from him for a fortnight. The fact is
    that he is in Holland, where he is getting married one of these
    days.</p>

    <p>Well, look here, without denying the least bit in the world
    the advantages of marriages, once it has been contracted, and
    of being quietly settled down in one's own home, when I think
    of the obsequial pomp of the reception and the lamentable
    congratulations on the part of the two families (still in a
    state of civilization), not to mention the fortuitous
    appearances in those chemist's jars where the antediluvian
    civil and religious magistrates are kept - goodness gracious -
    mustn't one pity the poor wretch who is obliged after having
    provided himself with the necessary documents, to repair to a
    locality, where, with a ferocity unequaled by the cruelest
    cannibals, he is married alive at a slow fire of receptions and
    the aforesaid funereal pomp.</p>

    <p>I remain greatly obliged to you for your friendly and
    beneficial visit, which contributed considerably to raising of
    my spirits. At present I am well, and I work at the sanatorium
    and its surroundings. From there I have just returned with two
    studies of orchards.</p>

    <p>[Here Vincent drew <art id=729_V-S_583b0>a sketch of Orchard in Bloom.</art>]</p>

    <p>Here is a hasty sketch of them - <art id=0514>the big one is a poor green
    landscape with little cottages, blue line of the Alpines, sky
    white and blue. The foreground, patches of land surrounded by
    cane hedges, where small peach trees are in bloom - everything
    is small there, the gardens, the fields, the orchards, and the
    trees, even the mountains, as in certain Japanese landscapes,
    which is the reason why the subject attracted me.</art></p>

    <p><art id=0515>The other landscape is nearly all green with a little lilac
    and grey - on a rainy day.</art></p>

    <p>I was very pleased to hear that you have settled down now,
    and I am longing for news about the progress of your work and
    about the character of the seaside scenery there.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">Since your visit my head has just about returned to its
    normal state, and for the time being I desire nothing better
    than that this will last. Above all it will depend on a very
    sober way of living.</label></p>

    <p>I intend to stay here for the next few months at least; I
    have rented an apartment consisting of two very small
    rooms.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">But at times it is not easy for me to take up living again,
    for there remain inner seizures of despair of a pretty large
    caliber.</label></p>

    <p>My God - those anxieties - who can live in the modern world
    without catching his share of them? My best consolation, if not
    the best remedy, is to be found in deep friendships, even
    though they have the disadvantage of anchoring us more firmly
    in life than would seem desirable in the days of our great
    sufferings.</p>

    <p>Once more many thanks for your visit, which gave me so much
    pleasure.</p>

    <p>A hearty handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent<br>
     March 1889 (sic)</p>

    <p>Address until the end of April: Place Lamartine, Arles</p>
