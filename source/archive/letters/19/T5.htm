    <p>Letter T 5<br>
     Paris, 14 April 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I was greatly touched by your letter, which we received
    yesterday <sup>1</sup>; really, you are making far too much of
    something which is entirely natural, without taking into
    account that you have repaid me many times over, by your work
    as well as by your friendship, which is of greater value than
    all the money I shall ever possess. It is very painful for me
    to know that you are still in an imperfect state of health.
    Though it seems to me that nothing in your letter betrays a
    weakness of the mind - on the contrary - the fact that you deem
    it necessary to go to a sanatorium is in itself rather serious.
    Let's hope that this is meant only as a preventative measure.
    Seeing that I know you well enough to consider you capable of
    all imaginable sacrifices, I have been contemplating the
    possibility that you have thought of this solution in order to
    inconvenience less those who know you. If this should be the
    case, I implore you not to do it, for life in such an
    establishment can hardly be pleasant. So you should know well
    what you are going to do, and I think you ought to consider
    whether you should perhaps try something else first. Either you
    might come here for some time, or you might go to Port-Aven
    during the summer, or again you might go and board with people
    who would take care of you.</p>

    <p>If, however, there was no hidden meaning in what you said
    when you wrote me, I think that you are quite right in going to
    St. R&eacute;my. By staying there for some time you will
    be able to regain confidence in your strength, and nothing will
    prevent you from returning to Arles after a certain lapse of
    time, if you should feel the inclination. Mr. Salles sent me
    some prospectuses of the St. R&eacute;my establishment,
    and it says that a third person should apply for admission. So
    I enclose the letter to the director of the establishment,
    which you may use as you think fit. As soon as you have decided
    in going away, I shall let you have the necessary money.</p>

    <p>Now I only want to add that we have been here since
    Saturday. By Monday we had more or less installed ourselves,
    and the apartment looks more lived in every day, thanks to all
    sorts of inventions of Jo's. We thoroughly understand each
    other, so we feel such a complete mutual satisfaction that we
    feel happier than I should say. We left Mother and the sisters
    in perfect health. Mother seems to be growing younger. She has
    now returned to Breda after an absence of about a month.</p>

    <p>My wedding gave her a lot of pleasure, particularly because
    Jo and she and Wil got on perfectly with each other; besides,
    she has something so sincere in her ways that there are quite a
    number of persons on whom she makes a very pleasant
    impression.</p>

    <p>Although there are many things in life which she knows
    nothing of, and which she will have to form an opinion about,
    she has such a foundation of good will and of zeal for doing
    the right thing that I am no longer afraid of the disillusions
    which I feared before our marriage. Up till now all goes better
    than I have been able to imagine, and I never dared hope for so
    much happiness.</p>

    <p>In Holland I lacked the time to see many pictures;
    notwithstanding this I saw <art id=jbride>the &ldquo;Jewish Bride&rdquo;</art> and
    the other Rembrandts again, the Frans Halses at Haarlem which I
    thought more beautiful than ever before, and the portrait of an
    old woman by Rembrandt in the Museum at Brussels. How beautiful
    the last-named picture is. There is really nothing more
    remarkable and characteristic in Holland than those old
    portraits. One feels far removed from this epoch when one looks
    at the follows of today. There was an exhibition at C.M.'s of
    charcoal sketches by Mauve, leaves out of his sketchbooks. Very
    touching things. Jet gave us one of these drawings as a
    present, which I am very, very glad of.</p>

    <p>Write us soon what you have definitely decided, and do not
    despair, for assuredly better days will come to you.</p>

    <p>I shake both your hands.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>
