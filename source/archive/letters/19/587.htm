  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your kind letter, thanks for the good news it
    contained and also for the 100-franc note. I was very, very
    glad to hear that you feel easier in your mind since your
    marriage. Then one thing that gave me great pleasure was your
    saying that Mother looks as if she were growing younger.
    Naturally very soon, or even now already, her mind will be
    running on seeing you with a child. That is dead certain.</p>

    <p>I very much regret for your sake and for your wife's too
    that you are not living at Ville d'Avray, for instance, instead
    of in Paris. But that will come, I hope. The great thing now is
    that you should pick up again instead of wearing yourself
    down.</p>

    <p>I went to see M. Salles and took your letter for the
    director of the asylum at St. R&eacute;my, and he is
    going there today, so I hope it will be fixed up by the end of
    the week. <label content="feelings.ambition">For myself, I shouldn't be unhappy or discontented if
    some time from now I could enlist in the Foreign Legion for
    five years (they take men up to forty, I think)</label>.<label content="health.general"> From the
    physical point of view my health is better than it used to be,
    and perhaps being in the army would do me more good than
    anything else. Anyway, I don't say that we must or can do this
    without consideration and consulting a doctor, but after all,
    we must count on it that whatever we do, it will not be quite
    so good as one could wish.</label></p>

    <p>But if not, naturally I can always do painting or drawing as
    long as it will work, and I do not in the least say No to that.
    As for coming to Paris or going to Pont-Aven, I do not feel I
    can, besides most of the time I have no very keen desire or
    keen regret.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, just as the waves pound against the sullen,
    hopeless cliffs, I feel a tempest of desire to embrace
    something, a woman of the domestic hen type, but after all, we
    must take this for what it is, the effect of hysterical
    overexcitement rather than a vision of actual reality.</p>

    <p>Besides, Rey and I have laughed about it sometimes, for he
    says that love is a microbe too, which does not surprise me
    much, and could not shock anyone, it seems to me. Isn't Renan's
    Christ a thousand times more comforting than so many papier
    m&acirc;che Christs that they serve up to you in the
    Duval establishments called Protestant, Roman Catholic or
    something or other churches? And why shouldn't it be so with
    love? As soon as I can, I am going to read Renan's Antichrist.
    I haven't the slightest idea what it will be like, but I
    believe beforehand that I shall find one or two ineffable
    things in it.</p>

    <p>Oh, my dear Theo, if you saw the olives just now...The
    leaves, old silver and silver turning to green against the
    blue. And the orange-coloured ploughed earth. It is something
    quite different from your idea of it in the North, the tender
    beauty, the distinction!</p>

    <p>It is like the pollard willows of our Dutch meadows or the
    oak bushes of our dunes, that is to say the rustle of an olive
    grove has something very secret in it, and immensely old. It is
    too beautiful for us to dare to paint it or be able to imagine
    it. The oleander - ah! that speaks of love and is beautiful
    like the Lesbos of Puvis de Chavannes, with women on the
    seashore. But the olive is different, if you want to compare it
    to something, it is Delacroix.</p>

    <p>This letter ends abruptly. I wanted to talk to you about
    lots more things, but it is just as I have already written, my
    ideas are not orderly.</p>

    <p>I will send shortly, by goods train, two cases of pictures,
    of which you must not hesitate to destroy a good number.</p>

    <p>I had a letter from Wil, who is going back to Mme. D.'s, a
    very nice letter. Ah! Cancer - it is cruel and difficult; by
    the way, it is very curious, but do you know that during all
    this strange and inexplicable commotion which has taken place
    in Arles, and in which I was mixed up, there was a perpetual
    talk of cancer? I understand that according to the belief of
    these virtuous natives who know the future so well, it appears
    - I believe that according to them I must be blessed with that
    particular malady. About which I naturally know nothing, but
    all the same it's an occurrence which remains absolutely
    inexplicable to me; besides, for the most part I have
    completely lost the recollection of those days in question, and
    I can reconstruct none of it. Even if it were so, I should try
    to console myself by thinking that diseases like this are
    perhaps to men what ivy is to the oak.</p>

    <p>A good handshake, and many thanks. Goodbye for now.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
