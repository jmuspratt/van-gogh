  <body>
    <p>St-R&eacute;my, 19<sup>th</sup> Sept 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Theo, Many thanks for your letter. It gives me very
    great pleasure that you on your side had already also thought
    of old Pissarro.</p>

    <p>You will see that there are better odds there other than
    elsewhere. Meanwhile business is business, and you ask me to
    answer you categorically - and you are right - if I would
    consent to go into a home in Paris in case of an immediate
    departure for this winter.</p>

    <p>I answer Yes to that, with the same calm and for the same
    reasons I had when I came to this place - even if this home in
    Paris should be a makeshift arrangement, which might easily be
    the case, for the opportunities to work are not bad here, and
    work is my only distraction.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">But having said this, please note that in my letter I gave a
    very serious reason as a motive for wishing to make a change.<br>
     And I insist on repeating it - I am astonished that with the
    modern ideas that I have, and being so ardent an admirer of
    Zola and de Goncourt and caring for things of art as I do, that
    I have attacks such as a superstitious man might have and that
    I get perverted and frightful ideas about religion such as
    never came into my head in the North.<br>
     On the supposition that I am very sensitive to surroundings,
    the already prolonged stay in these sour old cloisters, the
    Arles hospital and the house here would be enough in itself to
    explain these attacks.</label></p>

    <p>Then - even as a last resort - it might be necessary for the
    moment to go into a private asylum instead.<br>
     Nevertheless, to avoid doing, or having the appearance of
    doing, anything rash I declare, after having thus warned you of
    what I might wish at a given moment - that is, to go away - I
    assure you that I feel calm and confident enough to wait here
    another length of time to see if a new attack materializes this
    winter.<br>
     But <i>then</i> if I write you I want to get out of here you
    should not hesitate and arrange things beforehand, for you
    would know then that I had a serious reason or even several for
    going into a home not run, as this one is, by nuns, however
    excellent they may be.</p>

    <p>Now if by some arrangement or other, sooner or later, I
    should make a move, then let's begin as if practically nothing
    was wrong, being very cautious all the same and ready to listen
    to Rivet in the smallest matters, but don't let's begin by
    taking too formal measures straight off, as if it were a lost
    cause.</p>

    <p><label subject="health.gastrointestinal.stomach">As for eating a lot, I do - but if I were
    my doctor, I'd forbid it.</label></p>

    <p>I don't see any advantage for myself in enormous physical
    strength, because I am absorbed in the idea of doing good work
    and wishing to be an artist and nothing but that would be more
    logical.<br>
     Both Mother and Wil, after Cor's departure, have moved- they
    were absolutely right. It is not necessary that grief gathers
    in our heart like water in a swamp - but it is sometimes both
    expensive and impossible to change.</p>

    <p>Wil wrote beautifully that it is a great grief to them,
    Cor's departure.<br>
     It is odd, just when I was making that <art id=0603>copy of the
    &ldquo;Pieta&rdquo;</art> by Delacroix, I found where that canvas has
    gone. It belongs to a queen of Hungary, or of some other
    country thereabouts, who has written poems under the name of
    Carmen Sylva. The article mentioning her and the picture was by
    Pierre Loti, and he made you feel that this Carmen Sylva as a
    person was even more touching than what she wrote - and she
    wrote things like this: a childless woman is like a bell
    without a clapper - the sound of the bronze would perhaps be
    very beautiful, but no one will ever hear it.</p>

    <p>I have now seven copies out of the ten of Millet's
    &ldquo;Travaux des Champs.&rdquo;<br>
     I can assure you that making copies interests me enormously,
    and it means that I shall not lose sight of the figure, even
    though I have no models at the moment.<br>
     Besides, this will make a studio decoration for me or someone
    else.</p>

    <p>I should also like to copy the sower and the diggers.</p>

    <p>There is a photograph of the diggers after the drawing.</p>

    <p>And of the sower at Durand Ruel's the etching by Larat</p>

    <p>Among these same etchings is found the snow-covered field
    with a harrow.</p>

    <p>Then the four hours of the day; in the collection of wood
    engravings there are some copies.<br>
     I should like to have all these, at least the etchings and the
    wood engravings.</p>

    <p>It is a kind of study that I need, for I want to learn.
    Although copying may be the old system, that makes absolutely
    no difference to me. I am going to copy the Good Samaritan by
    Delacroix too.<br>
     I have done <art id=0631>a woman's portrait - the attendant's wife</art> - which
    I think you would like.</p>

    <p>I have done a duplicate of it which is less good than the
    one from life. And I am afraid they will take the latter; I
    should have liked you to have it. It is pink and black.<br>
     I am sending you today <art id=0626>my portrait of me, you must look at it
    for some time - you will see, I hope, that my features are much
    calmer, although my look is vaguer than before, it seems to
    me.</art></p>

    <p>I have <art id=627>another one which is an attempt when I was ill</art>, but I
    think this will please you more, and I have tried to make it
    simple; show it to old Pissarro when you see him.<br>
     You will be surprised at the effect les travaux des champs
    takes on in colour, it is a very profound series of his.</p>

    <p>What I am seeking in it and why it seems good to me to copy
    them I will tell you - they are always asking we painters to
    compose ourselves and be nothing but composers.<br>
     So be it - but it isn't like that in music - and if some
    person plays Beethoven, he adds his personal interpretation -
    in music and more especially in singing - the interpretation of
    a composer is something, and it is not a hard and fast rule
    that only the composer should play his own composition.<br>
     Very good - and I, mostly because I am ill at present, I am
    trying to do something to console myself, for my own
    pleasure.<br>
     I put the black and white by Delacroix or Millet or something
    made after them in front of me as a subject - and then I
    improvise colour on it, not, you understand, altogether by
    myself, but searching for memories</p>

    <p>of their pictures - but the memory, the vague consonance of
    colours which are at least right in feeling - that is my own
    interpretation.<br>
     Many people do not copy, many others do - I started on it
    accidentally, and I find that it teaches me, and above all it
    sometimes consoles me.</p>

    <p>And then my brush goes between my fingers as a bow would on
    the violin, and absolutely for my own pleasure. Today I tried
    <art id=0634>the woman shearing sheep in a range going from lilac to yellow</art>.
    They are little canvases of about size 5.<br>
     I thank you very much for the package of canvas and paints. In
    return I am sending you with the portrait the following
    canvases:</p>

    <p><art id=0735>Moonrise (hayricks)</art><br>
     <art id=0581>Study of Fields</art><br>
     <art id=0585>Study of Olives</art><br>
     <art id=0612>Study of the Night</art></p>

    <p><art id=0622>The Mountain</art><br>
     <art id=0611>Field of Green Wheat</art><br>
     <art id=0712>Olives</art><br>
     Orchard in Bloom<br>
     <art id=0744>Entrance to a Quarry</art></p>

    <p>The first four canvases are studies without the effect of a
    whole that the others have. I like very much the entrance to a
    quarry which I was doing when I felt this attack coming on
    because to my taste the sombre greens go well with the ochre
    tones; there is something sad in it which is healthy, and that
    is why it does not bore me. Perhaps that is also true of the
    Mountain. They will tell me that mountains are not like
    that and that there are black outlines of a finger's width. But
    after all it seemed to me that it expressed the passage in
    Rod's book - one of the very rare passages of his which I found
    good - about a country of somber mountains, lost among which
    one perceives some dark goatherds' huts where sunflowers are
    blooming.</p>

    <p>The olives with white clouds and background of mountains,
    also the moonrise and the night effect, these are exaggerations
    from the point of view of arrangement, their lines are warped
    as that of old wood. The olives are much more in character, as
    in the other study, and I tried to express the time of day when
    you see the green rose beetles and the cicadas flying about in
    the heat.</p>

    <p>The other canvases, the reaper, etc., are not dry.<br>
     And now in the bad weather I am going to make a lot of copies,
    for really I must do more figures. It is the study of the
    figure that teaches you to seize the essential and to
    simplify.</p>

    <p>When you say in your letter that I have done nothing but
    work, no - that is not right. I am myself very, very
    dissatisfied with my work, and the only thing that comforts me
    is that people with experience say you must paint for ten years
    for nothing. But what I have done is only those ten years of
    miserable and unwelcomed studies. Now a better period may come,
    but I shall have to get the figure stronger and I must refresh
    my memory by a very close study of Delacroix and Millet. Then I
    shall try to get my drawing clearer. Yes, misfortune is good
    for something, you gain time for study. I am adding to the roll
    of canvases a study of flowers - nothing much, but after all I
    do not want to tear it up.<br>
     In all this batch I think nothing at all good save the field
    of wheat, the mountain, the orchard, the olives with the blue
    hills and the portrait and the entrance to the Quarry, and the
    rest says nothing to me, because it lacks individual intention
    and feeling in the lines. Where these lines are close and
    deliberate it begins to be a picture, even if it is
    exaggerated. That is a little what Bernard and Gauguin feel,
    they do not ask the correct shape of a tree at all, but they insist absolutely
    that one can say if the shape is round or square - and my word,
    they are right, exasperated as they are by certain people's
    photographic and empty perfection. Certainly they will not ask
    the correct tone of the mountains, but they will say: In the
    Name of God, the mountains were blue, were they? Then chuck on
    some blue and don't go telling me that it was a blue rather
    like this or that, it was blue, wasn't it? Good - make them
    blue and it's enough!<br>
     Gauguin is sometimes like a genius when he explains this, but
    as for the genius Gauguin has, he is very timid about showing
    it, and it is touching the way he likes to say something really
    useful to the young. How strange he is all the same.</p>

    <p>It gives me great pleasure that Jo is well, and I think that
    you will feel much more in your element thinking of her
    pregnancy, and of course having worries too, than alone without
    these family worries. For you will feel more as one with
    nature.<br>
     When you think of Millet and Delacroix, what a contrast.
    Delacroix without a wife, without children.</p>

    <p>Millet surrounded by a big family, more than anybody.</p>

    <p>And yet what similarities there are in their work.<br>
     So Jouve has still kept his big studio and is working on a
    decoration.</p>

    <p>That man came very near to being an excellent painter. It is
    money trouble with him, he is forced to do a thousand things
    rather than painting, and it costs him more money than it
    brings in for living; when he does do something beautiful.</p>

    <p>And he is quickly losing his knack of drawing with the
    brush. That is probably caused by the old way of education,
    which is the same as nowadays in the studios - they fill in the
    outlines. And Daumier was always painting his face in the
    mirror to learn to draw!<br>
     Do you know what I think of pretty often - what I already said
    to you some time ago - that even if I did not succeed, all the
    same I thought that what I have worked at will be carried on.
    Not directly, but one isn't alone in believing in things that
    are true. And what does it matter personally then! I feel so
    strongly that it is the same with people as it is with wheat,
    if you are not sown in the earth to germinate there, what does
    it matter, in the end you are milled to become bread.<br>
     The difference between happiness and unhappiness.</p>

    <p>Both are necessary and useful, as well as death or
    disappearance ... it is so relative - and with life
    equally.</p>

    <p>Even during an illness that breaks me up or frightens me,
    that belief is unshaken.<br>
     How I should have liked to see those Meuniers.<br>
     Well, let it be understood that if I were to write again
    expressly and briefly that I should like to go to Paris, I
    should have a reason for it, which I have explained above. That
    meanwhile there is no hurry, and that, having warned you, I
    have confidence enough to wait for the winter and the attack
    which will perhaps come back then. But if it is a fit of
    religious exaltation again, then no delay, I would like to
    leave without giving reasons <i>at once</i>. Only we are not
    permitted, at least it would be indiscreet, to meddle with the
    sisters' management or even to criticize them.</p>

    <p>They have their beliefs and their own ways of doing good to
    others, sometimes they do very well. <i>But I do not warn you
    lightly</i>.<br>
     And it is not to recover more liberty or anything else that I
    don't have. So let's wait very calmly till an opportunity to
    settle things presents itself.<br>
     It is a great advantage that <label subject="health.gastrointestinal.stomach">my stomach works well,</label> and then I
    do not think I am so sensitive to cold. And besides I know what
    to do when the weather is bad, having this project of copying
    lots of things that I like.<br>
     I should very much like to see Millet reproductions in the
    schools. I think there are children who would become painters
    if only they saw good things.<br>
     Say hello to Jo and a handshake.</p>

    <p>Goodbye for now.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
