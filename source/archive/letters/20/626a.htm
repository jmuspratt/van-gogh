  <body>
    <p>Dear M. Aurier</p>

    <p>Thank you very much for your article in the <i>Mercure de
    France</i>, which surprised me a good deal. I admire it very
    much as a work of art in itself, it seems to me that you paint
    with words; in fact, I encounter my canvases anew in your
    article, but better than they are in reality, richer, more
    meaningful. Reflecting, however, that what you say would be
    more relevant to others than to myself, I feel uneasy.
    Monticelli in particular is a case in point. Since you say that
    &ldquo;he is, so far as I know, the only painter who perceives
    the range of colour of things with this intensity, with this
    metallic, gem-like quality,&rdquo; please go to see, at my
    brother's, a certain bouquet <sup>1</sup> by Monticelli - a
    bouquet in white, forget-me--not blue &amp; orange - and then
    you will understand what I mean. But for some time now the
    best, the most wonderful Monticellis have been in Scotland and
    England. There should still be a marvellous one of his in a
    gallery in the North - the one in Lille, I think - as rich and
    certainly no less French than Le depart pour
    Cyth&egrave;re by Watteau. At this moment M. Lauzet is in
    the process of reproducing about thirty Monticellis. As far as
    I know, there is no colourist who stems so directly from
    Delacroix, and yet it is probable, in my opinion, that
    Monticelli knew of Delacroix's colour theories at second-hand
    only; he had them in particular from Diaz and Ziem.
    Monticelli's artistic temperament seems to me exactly the same
    as that of the author of the Decameron - Boccaccio - a
    melancholy, rather resigned, unhappy man, watching the
    fashionable wedding party and the lovers of his time pass him
    by, painting them and analysing them - he, the outsider. Oh! He
    no more imitated Boccaccio than Henri Leys imitated the
    primitives.</p>

    <p>Anyway - what I am trying to say is that things seem to have
    mistakenly become attached to my name that you would do better
    to link to Monticelli, to whom I owe so much. I also owe a
    great deal to Paul Gauguin, with whom I worked for several
    months in Arles, and whom, moreover, I already knew in
    Paris.</p>

    <p>Gauguin, that curious artist, that strange individual, whose
    demeanour and look vaguely recall Rembrandt's Portrait of a Man
    at the Galerie Lacaze - that friend who likes to make one feel
    that a good picture should be equivalent to a good deed, not
    that he says so, but it is in fact difficult to be much in his
    company without being mindful of a certain moral
    responsibility.</p>

    <p>A few days before we parted company, when my illness forced
    me to go into an asylum, I tried to paint &ldquo;his empty
    place.&rdquo;</p>

    <p><art id=0499>It is a study of his wooden armchair, brown and dark red,
    the seat of greenish straw, and in place of the absent person,
    a lighted candle in a candlestick and some modern novels</art>. Should the opportunity
    arise, do please take another look at this study by way of a reminder of him. It is
    done throughout in broken tones of green and red.</p>

    <p>You may realize now that your article would have been fairer
    and - it seems to me - consequently more powerful, if, when
    dealing with the question of the nature of `tropical painting'
    and the question of colour, you had - before speaking of me -
    done justice to Gauguin and Monticelli. <i>For the role
    attaching to me, or that will be attached to me, will remain, I
    assure you, of very secondary importance</i>.</p>

    <p>Besides, I should like to ask you another question. Let us
    suppose that the <art id=0456>two canvases</art> of <art id=0458>sunflowers which are at
    present at the Vingtistes</art> have certain qualities of colour, and that they also symbolize
    &ldquo;gratitude.&rdquo; Are they any different from so many
    other pictures of flowers, more skilfully painted, which are
    not yet appreciated enough - the Roses tr&eacute;mi&egrave;res and the Iris jaunes by old
    Quost, the magnificent bunches of peonies which Jeannin
    produces in such abundance. You see, I find it very difficult
    to make a distinction between impressionism and other things. I
    do not see any use for much of the sectarian thinking we have
    seen these last few years, <i>but the absurdity of it frightens me</i>.</p>

    <p>And in conclusion, I confess I do not understand why you
    should vilify Meissonier. It may have been from the excellent
    Mauve that I have inherited a boundless admiration for
    Meissonier; Mauve was tireless in his praise of Troyon and
    Meissonier - a strange combination.</p>

    <p>I say this in order to draw your attention to how much
    people from other countries admire the artists of France
    without attaching the slightest importance to what,
    unfortunately, so often divides them. An often-repeated saying
    of Mauve's was something like, &ldquo;If one wants to use
    colour, one should also be able to draw an inglenook or an
    interior like Meissonier.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If you will do me the pleasure of accepting it, I shall
    include <art id=0620>a study of cypresses for you in the next batch I send
    to my brother, in remembrance of your article. I am still
    working on it at the moment, as I want to put a small figure
    into it</art>. The cypress is so characteristic of the Provence
    landscape. You will feel it, and say, &ldquo;Even the colour
    black.&rdquo; <label content="health.mental">Until now, I have not been able to do them as I
    feel them; the emotions that come over me in the face of nature
    can be so intense that I lose consciousness, and the result is
    a fortnight during which I cannot do any work.</label> However, before
    leaving here, I mean to have one more try at tackling the
    cypresses. The study I intend for you represents a group of
    them in the corner of a wheat field during the mistral on a
    summer's day. It is thus a kind of black note in the shifting
    blue of the flowing wide sky, with the vermilion of the poppies
    contrasting with the note of black. You will see that it forms
    something like the combination of tones found in those
    agreeable Scottish tartans of green, blue, red, yellow and
    black, which seemed so charming to you and to me at the time,
    and which, alas, we hardly see any more these days.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, dear Sir, please accept my grateful thanks
    for your article. If I come to Paris in the spring, I certainly
    shall not fail to thank you in person.</p>

    <p>Vincent v. Gogh</p>

    <p>It will be a year before the study I am going to send you
    will be thoroughly dry, particularly the impasto - I think it
    might be a good idea to give it a good coat of varnish.</p>

    <p>And in the meantime, it should be washed several times with
    plenty of water to get the oil out completely. This study is
    painted in pure Prussian blue, that much-maligned colour which
    Delacroix nevertheless used so much. I think that once the
    tones of Prussian blue are quite dry, you will, by varnishing,
    get the black, the very black tones that are needed to bring
    out the various dark greens.</p>

    <p>I am not quite sure how this study should be framed, but
    since it makes one think of those much-esteemed Scottish
    fabrics, I have noticed that a <i>very simple flat frame in
    BRIGHT ORANGE LEAD</i> gives the desired effect along with the
    blues of the background and the black-green of the trees.
    Without that there might not be enough red in the canvas, and
    the upper part would seem rather cold.</p>
