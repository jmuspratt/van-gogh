  <body>
    <p>My dear friend Bernard,</p>

    <p>My brother wrote me the other day that you were going to see
    my pictures. So I know you are back, and I am very pleased that
    you should have thought of going to see what I have done.</p>

    <p>On my part I am extremely eager to know what you have
    brought back from Pont-Aven.</p>

    <p>I am hardly in the right mind for writing a letter, but I
    feel an aching void because I am no longer informed at all of
    what Gauguin, you and others are doing.</p>

    <p>But I must necessarily be patient.</p>

    <p>I have another dozen studies here which will probably be
    more to your liking than this summer's, which my brother will
    have shown you.</p>

    <p>Among these studies there is <art id=0635>an &ldquo;Entrance to a
    Quarry&rdquo; pale lilac rocks in reddish fields, as in certain
    Japanese drawings</art>. In the design and in the
    division of the colour into large planes there is no little
    similarity to what you are doing at Pont-Aven.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I have been more master of myself in these last studies,
    because my health has steadied.</label> For instance, there is also a
    <art id=0641>size 30 canvas with ploughed fields, broken lilac, and a
    background of mountains rising to the very height of the
    picture; so nothing but rough fields and rocks, with a thistle
    and dried grass in a corner, and a little fellow, violet and
    yellow</art>.</p>

    <p>This will prove to you, I hope, that I have not got soft
    yet.</p>

    <p>My God! it is a very bad sort of country here; everything in
    it is difficult to do with regard to disentangling its inner
    character and avoiding making it a vaguely apprehended thing
    instead of the true soil of Provence. Now in order to get this
    right, one must toil hard, I tell you, and then of course it
    becomes somewhat abstract; for the great thing is to give the
    sun and the blue sky their full force and brilliance, and the
    scorched - and often melancholy - fields their delicate aroma
    of thyme.</p>

    <p>The olive trees here, old man, would be the very thing for
    you. I haven't had much of a chance to get them right this
    year, but I intend to return to the charge; they are silver
    against a soil of orange and violet hues, under the large white
    sun. Good Lord, I have seen things by certain painters, and by
    myself too, which did not do justice to the subject at all. In
    the first place there is something of Corot in that silvery
    grey, and this especially no one has done yet, whereas several
    painters have got their apple trees, for instance, and their
    willows right.</p>

    <p>For the same reason there are relatively few pictures
    representing vineyards, which nevertheless have such an
    ever-changing beauty.</p>

    <p>So there is still plenty for me to work on here.</p>

    <p>You know, there is something I am very sorry not to have
    seen at the Exhibition; it is a series of dwellings of all the
    peoples. I think either Garnier or Violet le Duc organized it.
    Now look here, could you, since you have seen it, give me an
    idea and especially a coloured sketch of the primitive Egyptian
    house. I think it is very simple, a plain cube on a terrace -
    but I should like to know its colouration too.</p>

    <p>I read in an article that it was blue, red and yellow. Did
    you pay attention to it? Please be sure to give me the
    information. You must not confuse it with Persian or Moroccan
    dwellings; there are said to be some that are nearly the same,
    but not the real thing.</p>

    <p>As for myself, however, the most admirable thing I know in
    the domain of architecture is a rural cottage with a
    moss-covered thatched roof and a blackened chimney. So I am
    very hard to please.</p>

    <p>I saw a sketch of ancient Mexican dwellings in one of the
    illustrated papers; they too seem to be primitive and very
    beautiful. Ah, if only one knew the things of those times, and
    if only one could paint the people of those times, who lived in
    the midst of them, it would be as beautiful as the work of
    Millet; I don't say in the matter of colour, but with regard to
    character, as something significant, something one has a firm
    faith in.</p>

    <p>Now what about your military service - are you going?</p>

    <p>I hope you will go see my canvases again, when I send my
    autumn studies in November; and if possible let me know what
    you have brought back from Brittany, for I attach great value
    to knowing which of your things you think best yourself. So I
    shall write again soon.</p>

    <p>I am working on <art id=0662>a large canvas of a &ldquo;Ravine&rdquo;; it
    is quite the same motif as your study with a yellow tree, which
    I still have: two bases of extremely solid rocks, between which
    there flows a rivulet; a third mountain blocking the ravine</art>.</p>

    <p>Such subjects certainly have a fine melancholy, but then it
    is fun to work in rather wild places, where one has to dig
    one's easel in between the stones lest the wind should blow the
    whole caboodle over.</p>

    <p>A handshake.</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours, Vincent</p>
