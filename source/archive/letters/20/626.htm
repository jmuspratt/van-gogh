  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I was busy writing you to send you the reply for M. Aurier
    when your letter arrived. I'm very glad that Jo and the little
    one are well and that she expects to be able to get up a few
    days from now. Then what you tell me about our sister also
    interests me very much. I think she was lucky to see Degas at
    his home.</p>

    <p>And so Gauguin has returned to Paris. I am going to copy my
    reply to M. Aurier to send to him, and you must make him read
    this article in the <i>Mercure,</i> for really I think they
    ought to say things like that of Gauguin, and of me only very
    secondarily. Gauguin wrote me that he had exhibited in Denmark
    and that this exhibition had been a great success. It seems a
    pity to me that he did not stay on here a little longer.
    Together we should have worked better than I have all by myself
    this year. And now we should have a little house of our own to
    live and work in, and could even put others up.</p>

    <p>Did you notice in the paper you sent me an article about the
    productivity of certain artists, Corot, Rousseau,
    Dupr&eacute;, etc? Do you remember how many times, when
    Reid was there, we talked about the same thing - the
    <i>necessity</i> of producing a lot.</p>

    <p>And that, shortly after I came to Paris, I said to you that
    I should be unable to do anything until I had 200 canvases,
    which would seem that for some natures, working too quickly is
    really all in the day's work, the normal condition of regular
    production, considering that a painter really ought to work
    quite as hard as a shoemaker, for instance.</p>

    <p>Wouldn't it be a good idea to send Reid, and perhaps
    Tersteeg too, or rather C. M., a copy of Aurier's article? It
    seems to me that we ought to take advantage of it to dispose of
    something in Scotland, either now or later.</p>

    <p>I think you will like <art id=0620>the canvas for M. Aurier</art>; it is in a
    terribly thick impasto and worked over like some Monticellis; I
    have kept it for almost a year. But I think I must try to give
    him something good for this article, which is very much a work
    of art in itself; and it will do us a real service against the
    day when we, like everybody else, shall be obliged to try to
    recover what the pictures cost. Anything beyond that leaves me
    pretty cold, but recovering the money it costs to produce is
    the very condition of being able to go on.</p>

    <p>As to the Impressionists' exhibition in March, I hope to
    send you a few more canvases, which are drying at the moment;
    if they do not arrive in time, you could make a selection from
    the ones that are at old Tanguy's.</p>

    <p>I have tried to copy <art id=0667>the &ldquo;Men Drinking&rdquo; by
    Daumier</art> and <art id=0669>the &ldquo;Convict Prison&rdquo;
    by Dor&eacute;</art>; it is very difficult.</p>

    <p>One of these days I hope to start on the<art id=0632> &ldquo;Good
    Samaritan&rdquo; by Delacroix</art> and the<art id=0670> &ldquo;Woodcutter&rdquo;
    by Millet</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="art.theory">Aurier's article would encourage me if I dared to let myself
    go, and venture even further, dropping reality and making a
    kind of music of tones with colour, like some Monticellis. But
    it is so dear to me, this truth, <i>trying to make it true</i>,
    after all I think, I think, that I would still rather be a
    shoemaker than a musician in colours.</label></p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">In any case, trying to remain true is perhaps a remedy in
    fighting the disease which still continues to disquiet me.</label></p>

    <p><label content="health.general">Just now I am in pretty good health, however, and I should
    think that if I were to stay some time with you, it would do
    much to counteract the influence which the company I am in here
    necessarily exercises.</label> But it seems to me that there is no
    hurry about this, and we must consider coolly if this is the
    moment to spend money on the journey; perhaps we could do
    something for Gauguin or Lauzet by giving up the journey.
    <label content="lifestyle.clothing">Recently I bought a suit, which cost me 35 francs. I must pay
    for it toward the end of March; with that I shall have enough
    for the whole year, for when I came here, I bought almost the
    same kind of suit for 35 francs, and it has lasted me all year.
    But I shall need a pair of shoes and some pants in March
    too.</label></p>

    <p>All things considered, life is not very expensive here, I
    think that in the North we should spend somewhat more.</p>

    <p>And that's why - even if I came to you for some time - the
    best policy would still be to go on with the work here.</p>

    <p>I don't know - either way seems good to me - but we mustn't
    be in a hurry to change.</p>

    <p>And don't you think that in Antwerp - if we carried out
    Gauguin's plan - it would be necessary to maintain a certain
    position, to furnish a studio, in fact to do as the greater
    part of the established Dutch painters do. It isn't so simple
    as it looks, and I should fear, for him as well as for me, a
    regular siege by the established artists, and there would be
    the same business as there was in Denmark all over again.</p>

    <p>Altogether we must begin by realizing that the established
    painters can do harm in the same old way to adventurers such as
    we should be in Antwerp, and might force us to clear out. And
    as for the dealers there, we mustn't count on them at all.</p>

    <p>The academy there is better, and they work more vigorously
    there than in Paris.</p>

    <p>And besides, at present Gauguin is constantly in Paris, his
    reputation holds there, and if he leaves for Antwerp, he might
    find that it is more or less difficult to <i>return</i> to
    Paris.</p>

    <p>In going to Antwerp, I should fear more for Gauguin than for
    myself, for naturally I'd shift for myself with the Flemings, I
    should again take up the peasant studies started some time ago,
    and very regretfully abandoned. There is no need to tell you
    that I have a strong affection for the Campine. But I foresee
    that for him the struggle might be very hard, I think that you
    must tell him the pros and cons exactly as I should. I will
    write him soon, mainly to send him my reply to M. Aurier's
    article, and I should think that, if he liked, we could work
    together again here if his attempts to find a shelter do not
    succeed. But he is very clever, and perhaps he will manage in
    Paris itself, and if his reputation holds there, he will do
    well, for he always has this, that he was the very first to
    work in the tropics. And this question will necessarily come up
    again. Give him my kindest regards, and if he likes, he can
    take the repetitions of the <art id=0454>&ldquo;Sunflowers&rdquo;</art> and the
    repetition of <art id=0505>&ldquo;La Berceuse&rdquo;</art> in exchange for
    something of his that you would like.</p>

    <p>If I came to Paris, I should have to touch up several
    canvases done at the beginning here, it isn't lack of work I
    should be suffering from there.</p>

    <p>Kind regards to Jo, and a good handshake in thought.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Please send the enclosed letter, after you have read it, to
    M. Aurier.</p>
