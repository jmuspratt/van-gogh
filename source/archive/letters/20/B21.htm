  <body>
    <p>My dear friend Bernard,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and thanks above all for the
    photographs, which give me some idea of your work. In fact, my
    brother wrote to me on the subject not long ago, and told me he
    was greatly taken with the harmony of the colours and the
    dignity of many of the figures.</p>

    <p>But now look, though I found the landscape in L'adoration
    des Mages so beautiful that I wouldn't dare say a word against
    it, you surely can't seriously imagine a confinement like that,
    in the middle of the road, with the mother starting to pray
    instead of suckling her child? Those bloated frogs of priests
    on their knees as though they're having an epileptic fit are
    also part of it, God alone knows how and why!</p>

    <p>No, I can't call that sound, for if I am at all capable of
    spiritual ecstasy, then I feel exalted in the face of truth, of
    what is possible, which means I bow down before the study - one
    that had enough power in it to make a Millet tremble - of
    peasants carrying a calf born in the fields back home to the
    farm. That, my friend, is what people everywhere, from France
    to America, have felt. And having performed a feat like that,
    can you really contemplate reverting to medieval tapestries?
    Can that really be what you mean to do? No! You can do better
    than that, and know that you must look for what is possible,
    logical and true, even if that means turning your back on those
    Parisian things &agrave; la Baudelaire. How I prefer
    Daumier to that fellow!</p>

    <p>An <i>Annunciation</i>? Of what - I see figures of angels -
    quite elegant, no doubt - a terrace with two cypresses which I
    like very much. There is an enormous amount of sky, of
    brightness but, once over this first impression, I wonder if
    the whole thing is not a misrepresentation, and then the
    figures lose their meaning for me.</p>

    <p>Let me make it perfectly clear that I was looking forward to
    seeing the sort of things that are <art id=retonnes>in that painting of yours
    which Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow so
    beautifully composed, the colour with such naive distinction</art>.
    And you are trading that in for something - I won't prevaricate
    - bogus, spurious!</p>

    <p>Last year you did <art id=adeline>a painting</art> <sup>1</sup> which - according
    to what Gauguin told me - looked, I believe, something like
    this:</p>

    <p>[<art id=784_V-B_B210>A sketch of the painting was drawn here.</art>]</p>

    <p>on a grassy foreground, the figure of a young girl in a blue
    or whitish dress, lying stretched out full-length; on the
    second plane the edge of a beech wood, the ground covered with
    fallen red leaves, vertical grey-green tree trunks across it.
    Her hair, I think, is in a tint that serves as a complementary
    colour to the white dress: black if that garment is white,
    orange if it is blue. Well, I said to myself what a simple
    subject and how well he knows how to create grace from
    nothing!</p>

    <p>Gauguin also mentioned another subject, just three trees,
    the effect of orange foliage against a blue sky, but with very
    clear outlines, very strictly divided into planes of
    contrasting, clear colours - splendid!</p>

    <p>And when I compare that with the nightmare of a Christ au
    jardin des oliviers, then, good God, I mourn, and with this
    letter I ask you once more, shouting at the top of my voice:
    please try to be yourself again! Le Christ portant sa croix is
    appalling. Are those touches of colour in it meant to be
    harmonious? I cannot forgive your using a
    <i>clich&eacute;</i>, yes, a clich&eacute;, for
    your composition.</p>

    <p>When Gauguin was in Arles, I once or twice allowed myself to
    be led astray into abstraction, as you know, for instance in
    <art id=0508>the Berceuse</art>, in <art id=0497>the Woman Reading a Novel,
    black against a yellow bookcase</art>. At the time,
    I considered abstraction an attractive method. But that was
    delusion, dear friend, and one soon comes up against a brick
    wall.</p>

    <p>I don't say one might not try one's hand at it after a whole
    life long of experimentation, of hand-to-hand struggle with
    nature, but personally, I don't want to trouble my head with
    such things. All year I was doing little things after nature,
    without giving a thought to impressionism or whatever else. And
    yet, once again I allowed myself to be led astray into reaching
    for stars that are too big - another failure - and I have had
    my fill of that.</p>

    <p>So right now I'm working in the olive grove in search of all
    sorts of effects of grey sky against yellow soil, with a
    grey-green hue in the foliage, and then again with the soil and
    the leaves all purple against a yellow sky, or a red-ochre soil
    and green-pink sky. Yes, I do find that more interesting than
    the above-named abstractions.</p>

    <p>The reason I haven't written for so long is that I've been
    trying to keep on top of my illness and was reluctant to enter
    into discussions, sensing danger in those abstractions. If one
    carries on working quietly, beautiful subjects come of their
    own accord. Believe me, it is of the utmost importance to
    immerse oneself in reality, without any preconceived ideas,
    without any Parisian prejudice.</p>

    <p>As it happens, I'm not at all satisfied with this year, but
    it may yet provide a solid basis for the next. I have feasted
    upon the air in the hills and the orchards. For the rest l
    shall have to wait and see. My ambition reaches no further than
    a few clods of earth, sprouting wheat, an olive grove, a
    cypress - the last, for instance, far from easy to do.</p>

    <p>How is it possible that you, who like the primitives and
    study them, don't know Giotto? Gauguin and l saw a tiny little
    panel of his in Montpelier, the death of some holy woman or
    other. In it, the expression of pain and ecstasy is so human
    that, even though we are in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup>
    century, one could think and feel one was there, so much does
    one share the emotion.</p>

    <p>If I were to see the canvases themselves, I might well be
    enchanted by the colour, but you also mention portraits you've
    done that are striking likenesses. That's good, and you will
    have put more of yourself into them.</p>

    <p>Now a description of a canvas that is in front of me at the
    moment <art id=0660>A view of the garden of the asylum where I am staying;
    to the right a grey terrace and a part of the house.</art> A few faded rose bushes, the garden
    to the left - red ochre - scorched by the sun, covered with pine needles. The
    edge of the garden is planted with large pines with red-ochre
    trunks and branches, the green foliage darkened with a mixture
    of black. These tall trees stand out against a yellow evening
    sky crossed with purple stripes, the yellow yielding to pink
    and green higher up. A wall - also red ochre - bars the view
    and only a purple and yellow-ochre hill appears above it. The
    nearest tree has an enormous trunk but has been struck by
    lightning and sawn off. However, a branch still juts high up
    into the air and sends down a rain of dark green needles. This
    sombre giant - with its hurt pride - contrasts, if you were to
    lend it human characteristics, with the pale smile of a last
    rose on the fading bush in front of it. Under the big trees,
    empty stone benches, mournful little box trees, the sky is
    reflected - yellow - in a puddle after the rain. A ray of sun
    turns the dark ochre into orange with its last reflection.
    Small black figures wander about here and there among the tree
    trunks.</p>

    <p>Of course, you realize that the combination of red ochre,
    green darkened with grey and the black stripes indicating the
    contours, arouses that anguished feeling, the so-called
    &ldquo;black-and-reds,&rdquo; with which some of my fellow
    patients are afflicted. Moreover, the motif of the great tree,
    struck by lightning, the wan pink-green smile of the last
    autumn flower, serve to reinforce this impression.</p>

    <p>Another canvas shows <art id=0737>a rising sun above a field of young
    wheat - receding lines, furrows that run to the top of the
    canvas, towards a wall and a row of lilac hills</art>. The field is purple and yellow-green.
    The white sun is surrounded by a large yellow halo. Here, in contrast to the
    first canvas, I have tried to express calmness, great
    peace.</p>

    <p>I am telling you about these canvases, and about the first
    one in particular, to remind you that one can express anguish
    without making direct reference to the actual Gethsemane, and
    that there is no need to portray figures from the Sermon on the
    Mount in order to express a comforting and gentle motif.</p>

    <p>Oh, it is only right and proper to be moved by the Bible,
    but present-day reality has so strong a hold over us that even
    when we try to imagine the past the minor events in our lives
    immediately wrench us out of our musings, and our own
    adven-tures throw us back irrevocably upon our personal
    feelings: joy, boredom, suffering, anger or a smile.</p>

    <p>The Bible, the Bible! Millet, who grew up with it from
    childhood, did nothing but read that book! And yet he never, or
    hardly ever, painted biblical pictures. Corot did do a Mount of
    Olives, with Christ and the evening star, sublime. In his work
    you can feel Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles and sometimes the
    Gospels as well, but so discreetly and always taking account of
    all the modern feelings that all of us share.</p>

    <p>But what of Delacroix, you may ask. Yes, Delacroix - but
    then you would have to study quite a lot more, indeed, you
    would have to make a study of history before you could depict
    things as he did.</p>

    <p>So, my dear fellow, those biblical paintings of yours are
    hopeless. There are only a few who make such a mistake, and a
    mistake it is, but once you have turned your back on it, I dare
    say the results will be marvellous! Sometimes our mistakes show
    us the right way.</p>

    <p>Come now, make up for it by painting your garden just as it
    is, or any way you like. Anyhow, it's a good idea to put
    something worthy, something noble, into your figures, studies
    take real effort and hence are never a waste of time. Being
    able to divide a canvas into large intermingling planes, to
    devise contrasting lines and forms - that is technique, tricks
    of the trade, if you like, but ultimately a sign that your
    craftsmanship is being strengthened, and that is all to the
    good.</p>

    <p>No matter how odious and burdensome painting may be at
    present, those who have chosen this profession - if only they
    pursue it with zeal - are dutiful, sound and faithful men.
    Society often renders our existence hard, and that is the
    source of our impotence and of the imperfection of our work. I
    believe that even Gauguin suffers greatly from this and cannot
    develop, although he has it in him to do so. I myself am
    frustrated by a total lack of models. On the other hand, there
    are some very beautiful spots around here. I have just finished
    5 size 30 canvases of olive groves.<label content="health.general"> And the reason I am still
    here is that my health is making good progress.</label> What I am doing
    is hard, harsh, but that is because I am trying to get back on
    my feet with work that is a bit rough, having been afraid that
    I would go soft with abstractions.</p>

    <p>Have you seen <art id=0618>my study of a small reaper, a yellow wheat
    field and a yellow sun?</art> It isn't the real thing yet, but at
    least I have tackled the devilish problem of yellow in it. I am
    referring to the one with the thick impasto and done on the
    spot, and not to <art id=0617>the copy with the hatchings, which has a much
    weaker effect</art>. I'd like to do it in deep sulphur-yellow.</p>

    <p>I still have a great deal more to say to you, and though I
    can tell you today that my head has grown somewhat calmer, I
    used to be afraid of getting excited before I got cured. With a
    very cordial handshake in my thoughts, for Anquetin too, and
    any other friends should you see them, believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>P.S. I don't need to tell you how sorry I am for your sake,
    as well as for your father's that he did not approve of your
    spending the season with Gauguin. The latter wrote me that your
    military service has been postponed for a year because of your
    health. Thanks all the same for your description of the
    Egyptian house. I should have liked to know too whether it is
    larger or smaller than a rural cottage in this country - in
    short, its proportions in relation to the human figure. But it
    is above all about the colouration that I am asking for
    information.</p>
