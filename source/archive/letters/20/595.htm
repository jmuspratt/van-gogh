  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thank you for yesterday's letter. I too cannot write as I
    would like, but after all we live in such a disturbed time that
    there can be no way of having opinions fixed enough to form any
    judgment of things.</p>

    <p>I should have liked very much to know if you are still
    having your meals in the restaurant or whether you are living
    more at home. I hope so, for in the long run that must be
    best.</p>

    <p>Things are going well with me. You will understand that
    after almost half a year now of absolute frugality in eating,
    drinking, smoking, with two-hour baths twice a week of late,
    it's evident that it should steady me a lot. So it's all going
    well, and as for the work, far from wearing me out, it occupies
    and distracts me - which I am in great need of.</p>

    <p>I am glad to hear that Isa&auml;cson has found
    some things that please him in my consignment. He and De Haan
    seem very faithful, and that is so rare nowadays that one must
    appreciate it. And I am also glad to hear that someone else has
    turned up who actually saw something in the woman's figure in
    black and yellow. That does not surprise me, though I think
    that the merit is in the model and not in my painting.</p>

    <p>I despair of ever finding models. Ah, if now and then I had
    someone like that or like the woman who posed for<art id=0489> &ldquo;La
    Berceuse,&rdquo;</art> I'd do something very different yet.</p>

    <p>I think you were right not to show any pictures of mine at
    the exhibition that Gauguin and the others had. My not yet
    being recovered is reason enough for my keeping out of it
    without giving them offense.</p>

    <p>I think that unquestionably Gauguin and Bernard have great
    and real merit. And it remains very understandable that for
    beings like them - young and very vigorous, who <i>must</i>
    live and try to hack out their way - it would be impossible to
    turn all their canvases to the wall until it should please
    people to admit them into something, into the official stew.
    You cause a stir by exhibiting in cafes; I do not say it is not
    bad taste to do it, but I myself have this crime on my
    conscience twice over, as I exhibited at the Tambourin and at
    the Avenue de Clichy, without counting the upset caused to 81
    worthy anthropophagi of the good town of Arles and their
    excellent mayor.</p>

    <p>So in any case I am worse and more to blame than they, as
    far as that goes, in causing stir enough, my word, quite
    involuntarily. Young Bernard - I think - has already done some
    absolutely astonishing canvases in which there is a sweetness
    and something essentially French and sincere of rare
    quality.</p>

    <p>After all, neither he nor Gauguin are artists who could ever
    look as if they were trying to get into a universal exhibition
    by the back stairs.</p>

    <p>Be reassured about this. That they <i>could not</i> hold
    their tongues is very understandable. That the impressionist
    movement has had no unity proves that they aren't as skilled
    fighters as other artists such as Delacroix and Courbet.</p>

    <p>At last I have <art id=0712>a landscape with olive trees</art> and also <art id=0612>a new
    study of a starry sky.</art> Though I have not seen
    either Gauguin's or Bernard's last canvases, I am pretty well
    convinced that these two studies I've spoken of are parallel in
    feeling.</p>

    <p>When you have looked at these two studies for some time, and
    that of the ivy as well, it will perhaps give you some idea,
    better than words could, of the things that Gauguin and Bernard
    and I sometimes used to talk about, and which we've thought
    about a good deal; it is not a return to the romantic or to
    religious ideas, no. Nevertheless, by going the way of
    Delacroix, more than is apparent, by colour and a more
    spontaneous drawing than delusive precision, one could express
    the purer nature of a countryside compared with the suburbs and
    cabarets of Paris.</p>

    <p>One would try to paint human beings who are also more serene
    and pure than Daumier had before his eyes, but following
    Daumier, of course, in the drawing.</p>

    <p>Whether it exists or not is something we may leave aside,
    but we do believe that nature extends beyond St. Ouen.</p>

    <p>Perhaps even while reading Zola, we are moved by the sound
    of the pure French of Renan, for instance.</p>

    <p>And after all, while the Chat noir draws us women after its
    fashion and Forain in a fashion that's masterly, we do some of
    our own, and being less Parisian but no less fond of Paris and
    its graces, we try to prove that something very different
    exists as well.</p>

    <p>Gauguin, Bernard and I may stop at that point perhaps and
    not conquer, but neither shall we be conquered; perhaps we
    exist neither for the one thing nor for the other, but to give
    consolation or to prepare the way for a painting that will give
    even greater consolation.</p>

    <p>Perhaps Isa&auml;cson and De Haan will not succeed
    either, but in Holland they felt the compulsion to maintain
    that Rembrandt did great painting and not delusive photography;
    they also felt something that was different.</p>

    <p>If you can get the <art id=0482>&ldquo;Bedroom&rdquo;</art> re-canvassed, it
    would be better to have it done <i>before</i> sending it to
    me.</p>

    <p>I have no more white at all at all.</p>

    <p>You would give me great pleasure by writing again soon. I so
    often think that after some time your marriage, I hope, will
    give you back your old vigour, and that a year from now you
    will be in better health.</p>

    <p>What I should very much like to have to read here now and
    then would be a Shakespeare. There is one at a shilling,
    <i>Dick's Shilling Shakespeare</i>, which
    is complete. There are plenty of editions, and I think the
    cheap ones have been altered less than the more expensive ones.
    In any case I don't want one that costs more than 3 francs.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, whatever is too bad in this batch, put it aside
    altogether - no use having stuff like that about; it may be
    useful later on to remind me of things. Whatever is good in it
    will show up better in a smaller number of canvases.</p>

    <p>The rest are only worth putting flat in some corner between
    two sheets of cardboard with some old newspapers between the
    studies. I am sending you a roll of drawings.</p>

    <p>Handshakes for you, Jo, and our friends.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>The drawings - <art id=1467>Hospital at Arles</art>, <art id=1468>the
    Weeping Tree in the Grass</art>, the Fields and <art id=1543>the Olives</art>
    are a continuation of those old ones of Montmajour,
    the others are hasty studies made in the garden.</p>

    <p>There is no hurry for the Shakespeare, if they haven't got
    an edition like that, it doesn't take an eternity to order
    it.</p>

    <p>Do not fear that I shall ever, of my own will, rush to dizzy
    heights. Unfortunately we are subject to the circumstances and
    the maladies of our time, whether we like it or not.<label content="health.mental"> But with
    the number of precautions I am now taking, I am not likely to
    relapse, and I hope that the attacks will not begin again.</label></p>
