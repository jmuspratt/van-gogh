    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">Today I wanted to read the letters which had come for me,
    but I was not clear-headed enough yet to be able to understand
    them.</label></p>

    <p>However, I am trying to answer you at once, and I hope that
    this will clear away in a few days. Above all I hope that you
    are well, and your wife and child too. Don't worry about me,
    even if this should last a bit longer, and write the same thing
    to those at home and give them kindest regards from me.</p>

    <p>Remember me to Gauguin, who wrote me a letter for which I
    thank him very, very much; I am terribly dazed in the head, but
    must try to be patient. Once more kindest regards to Jo and her
    little boy and a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I take up this letter again to try to write, it will come
    little by little,<label content="health.symptoms"> the thing is that my head is so bad, without
    pain it is true, but altogether stupefied.</label> I must tell you that
    there are, as far as I can judge, others who have the same
    thing wrong with them that I have, and who, after having worked
    part of their life, are reduced to helplessness now. It isn't
    easy to learn much good between four walls, that's natural, but
    all the same it is true that there are people who can no longer
    be left at liberty as though there were nothing wrong with
    them. And that means I am pretty well or altogether in despair
    about myself. Perhaps, perhaps I might really recover if I were
    in the country for a time.</p>

    <p>My work was going well, <art id=0671>the last canvas of branches in
    blossom</art> - you will see that it was perhaps the best, the most
    patiently worked thing I had done, painted with calm and with a
    greater firmness of touch. And the next day, down like a brute.
    Difficult to understand, things like that, but alas! it's like
    that. I have a great desire, however, to start working again,
    but Gauguin also writes that he - and he is robust - also
    despairs of being able to go on. And isn't it true that we
    often hear the same story about artists? My poor boy, just take
    things as they come, don't be grieved over me, it will
    encourage and sustain me more than you think, to know that you
    ate running your household well. Then after a time of
    affliction perhaps peaceful days will come again for me too.
    But all the same I will send you some canvases in a little
    while.</p>

    <p>Russell wrote me too, and I think it is kind of him to have
    written, showing that he does not altogether forget us; on your
    part speak of him from time to time, so that people may know
    that though he works alone, he is a very sound man, and I think
    he will do good things like what one used to see in England,
    for instance. He is a thousand times right to barricade himself
    a bit.</p>

    <p>Remember me to the Pissarros, very shortly I am going to
    read the letters more calmly, and I hope to write again
    tomorrow or the next day.</p>

    <p>[On February 24 Dr. Peyron wrote Theo that Vincent had again
    had an attack after spending two days in Arles. He had been
    bought back to St.-R&eacute;my in a carriage, and it was
    not known where he had spent the night. The picture
    representing an Arl&eacute;sienne which he had taken
    along with him to Arles was never found. On April 1 Dr. Peyron
    wrote again that the attack was lasting longer this time, and
    that it definitely proved that these trips were bad for
    him.]</p>
