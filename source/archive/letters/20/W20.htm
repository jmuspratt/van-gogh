    <p>W20 <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Saint-R&eacute;my, c. 20 February 1890</p>

    <p>My Dear Sister,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your last two letters, the one dated from
    Paris, and today's. I am touched by what you write further
    about Jo's confinement - how very brave and very good you have
    been, staying with her all the time. In those circumstances in
    which we feel the strain of anxiety, I should probably be, much
    more than you, like a frightened, wet chicken.</p>

    <p>Well, the result is that after all that the child is there -
    and also I shall write a letter to Mother telling her so; a day
    or two ago I started painting <art id=0671<a picture for her of a blue sky
    with branches full of blossoms standing out against it</art>.
    It is possible that I shall send it soon - at least I
    hope so - toward the end of March. Tomorrow or the day after I
    shall try to make the trip to Arles again as a kind of trial,
    in order to see if I can stand the strain of traveling out of
    ordinary life without a return of the attacks.</p>

    <p>Perhaps in my case it is necessary to fortify my resolution
    not to allow myself to have a weak head. Naturally, in
    consequence of continual brainwork, an artist's thoughts get
    somewhat exaggerated and eccentric at times.</p>

    <p>I thought the article by Mr. Aurier - leaving out of
    consideration whether I deserve what he says of me - very
    artistic and very curious in itself. But it is rather like this
    that I <i>ought to be</i>, instead of the sad reality of how I
    do feel. I wrote to tell him that in any case it seems to me
    that Monticelli and Gauguin are more like this - that it seems
    to me that the part which should be assigned to me is of a
    secondary, very secondary order.</p>

    <p>The ideas he speaks of are not my property, for in general
    all the impressionists are like that, are under the same
    influence, and we are all of us more or less neurotic. This
    renders us very sensitive to colours and their particular
    language, the effects of complimentary colours, of their
    contrasts and harmony. But when I had read that article I felt
    almost mournful, for I thought: I ought to be like that, and I
    feel so inferior. And pride, like drink, is intoxicating, when
    one is praised, and has drunk the praise up. It makes one sad,
    or rather - I don't know how to express it, I feel it - but it
    seems to me that the best work one can do is what is done in
    the privacy of one's home without praise. And then you do not
    always find it a <i>sufficiently</i> friendly disposition among
    artists. Either they exaggerate a person's qualities, or else
    they neglect him too much. However, I should be pleased to be
    able to believe that justice is better done after all than
    appears to be the case.</p>

    <p>One ought to be able to laugh now and then, and to make
    merry a little, or rather very much.</p>

    <p>I think you were lucky to see Degas in his home. I am
    working on <art id=0540>a portrait of an Arl&eacute;sienne</art>,
    in which I am after another expression than that of the
    Parisiennes. Oh Millet! Millet! How he painted humanity and
    that Something on High which is familiar and yet solemn. And
    then to think in our time that man wept when he started
    painting, that Giotto and Angelico painted on their knees -
    Delacroix so full of grief and feeling&hellip;<i>nearly</i>
    smiling. What are we impressionists to be acting like them
    already? Soiled in the struggle for life&hellip; &ldquo;Who
    will give back to the soul what the breath of revolutions has
    taken away&rdquo; - this is the cry of distress uttered by the
    poet of another generation, who seemed to have a presentiment
    of our present weaknesses, diseases, wanderings. And I often
    say, are we as fresh of mind as the old Belgian Henri
    Conscience? - &ldquo;Ah, I was glad of the success at Brussels,
    because of that Campine of Antwerp, which I will seek to call
    to mind now and then when I see the quiet furrows of the
    fields, although I feel that I have become a rather degenerate
    child.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Thinking of this, but far away, I feel the desire to renew
    myself, and to try to apologize for the fact that my pictures
    are after all almost a cry of anguish, although in the rustic
    sunflower they may symbolize gratitude. You see that I do not
    reason well yet - it would be better to know how to calculate
    the price of a pound of bread or a quarter of a pound of
    coffee, as the peasants do. And here we are again in the same
    spot. Millet set the example by living in a hovel, and holding
    intercourse only with people who did not know the bounds of
    pride and eccentricity.</p>

    <p>So rather a little wisdom than a lot of energetic zeal. And
    for the rest - like all the rest -</p>

    <p>I hope to write you again before long; keep in good health,
    Mother too.</p>

    <p>I hope to do some portraits in Paris; I have always believed
    that one learns to think by painting portraits. This is
    something the art lovers like least, but portraits are
    something almost useful and at times pleasant; like furniture
    one knows, they remind one of things long gone by.</p>

    <p>I embrace you in thought; if the other sisters should also
    like to have some canvases, you can ask Theo for others, and
    you will select them according to your taste. Once again the
    best of wishes, and a cordial handshake.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I should not be at all disgusted if some more pictures went
    to Holland, so you'll know this if an occasion arises.</p>
