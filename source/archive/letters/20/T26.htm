    <p>Letter T26 <sup>1</sup><br>
     Paris, 29 January 1890</p>

    <p>Dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Every since Christmas it has been my intention, day after
    day, to write to you - there is even a half-finished letter to
    you in my writing case - and even now, if I should not make
    haste to write you this letter, you would get the news sooner
    that your little namesake had arrived. Before this moment,
    however, I want to say good night to you. It is precisely
    midnight - the doctor has gone to sleep for a while, for
    tonight he prefers to stay in the house - Theo, Mother and Wil
    are sitting around the table with me - awaiting future events -
    it is such a strange feeling - over and over again that
    question, Will the baby be here by tomorrow morning? I cannot
    write much, but I so dearly wanted to have a chat with you -
    Theo brought along the article from the Mercure this morning,
    and after we had read it, Wil and I talked about you for a long
    time - I am eager for your next letter, which Theo is anxiously
    awaiting too - shall I read it? So far all has gone well - I
    must try to be of good heart. Tonight - and all through these
    days for that matter - I have been wondering so much whether I
    have really been able to do something to make Theo happy in his
    marriage - he certainly has me. He has been so good to me, so
    good - if things should not turn out well - if I should have to
    leave him - then <i>you</i> must tell him - for there is nobody
    on earth he loves so much - that he must never regret that he
    married me, for he has made me, oh, so happy. It is true that
    such a message sounds sentimental - but I cannot tell him now -
    for half of my company has fallen asleep, he too, for he is so
    very tired. Oh, if I could give him a healthy sweet little boy,
    wouldn't that make him happy! I think I shall stop now, for I
    have attacks of pain every now and then which prevent me from
    thinking or writing in an orderly way. When you receive this
    all will be over. Believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours affectionately, Jo</p>
