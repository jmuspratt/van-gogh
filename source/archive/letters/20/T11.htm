    <p>Letter T11<br>
     Paris, 5 July 1889</p>

    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>This time I shall try to write you in French; in the first
    place I know you like it better, and then . . . if two people
    express themselves in the same language, they will understand
    each other better in the end, I think. Only, as for me, I am
    not in the habit of writing in French, and I am afraid I am
    going to make mistakes which will seem very ridiculous to you -
    but I shall do the best I can. After some time I hope to be
    able to express myself - but at the moment, if the strangers I
    meet do not speak English, the conversation is far from
    animated, I assure you.</p>

    <p>I am now going to tell you a great piece of news, on which
    we have concentrated a good deal of our attention lately - it
    is that next winter, toward February probably, we hope to have
    a baby, a pretty little boy - whom we are going to call
    Vincent, if you will consent to be his godfather. Of course I
    know we must not count on it too much, and that it may well be
    a little girl, but Theo and I cannot help imagining that the
    baby will be a boy. When I told them at Amsterdam and Breda,
    they all replied, &ldquo;Aren't you pleased, what happiness,
    etc., etc.&rdquo; - and yet, to tell the honest truth, I was
    not pleased at all when I found out about it; on the contrary,
    I was very unhappy, and Theo had a lot of trouble consoling me.
    It's not that I don't like babies - take my little brother, who
    is now twelve years old; I held him in my arms when he was
    hardly two hours old, and I think that there is nothing
    prettier in the world than a baby - but this is something of a
    selfish pleasure.<label content="Theo.health"> When I think how neither Theo nor I are in
    very good health, I am greatly afraid that we are going to have
    a weak child, and to my way of thinking the greatest treasure
    that parents can give to their child is a strong constitution.</label>
    But in this respect the doctor has reassured me a good deal,
    and then taking good food and taking good care of oneself may
    do a lot; the baby will have nothing to complain of in this
    respect.</p>

    <p>Do you remember <art id=441>the portrait of the Roulin baby you sent to
    Theo</art>? Everybody admires it greatly and people have already
    asked me many times, &ldquo;Why have you put this portrait into
    such an out-of-the-way corner?&rdquo; The reason is that from
    my place at the table I can just see the big blue eyes and the
    pretty little hands and the round cheeks of the baby, and I
    like to imagine that ours will be equally strong, and equally
    healthy, and equally beautiful - and that his uncle will come
    one day to paint his portrait!</p>

    <p>In one of your last letters you asked Theo whether he was
    still dining at restaurants. Oh dear no - never - what would be
    the good of being married if one could not dine at home? He
    always comes home at twelve o'clock to lunch and at half-past
    seven for dinner. Often in the evening somebody drops in,
    Isa&Atilde;&curren;cson or Hart Nibbrig. Tersteeg dined with us
    twice, and De Haan has come to see us too--and when he was
    there Mr. Pissarro and his son came too. In general we are very
    tired at night, and we go to bed early, but notwithstanding
    this I think Theo is looking far from well, but that
    Sacr&eacute;tan sale caused him a lot of fatigue, and
    besides, the heat is so overwhelming! Don't talk to me of Paris
    in such weather as this, and Theo says that in August it is
    even worse!</p>

    <p>I read with great pleasure what you wrote to Theo about
    reading Shakespeare. <sup>1</sup> Isn't it beautiful? - and so
    few people know him. &ldquo;It is too difficult&rdquo; [they
    say] - but that is not true - I for my part understand him much
    better than Zola. But when I think that such beautiful things
    were written nearly three hundred years ago, I think the world
    has not made much progress since then. I once saw The Merchant
    of Venice at the theater when I was in London, and the
    impression it made on me was a great deal stronger still then
    when I only read it. I have also seen Hamlet and Macbeth, but
    that was in Dutch - and then it loses much of its beauty.</p>

    <p>Now I am going to say goodbye - please write us your opinion
    about our little boy, for a boy it must be.</p>

    <p>Your sister, Jo</p>
