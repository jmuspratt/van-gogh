    <p>Letter 618<br>
     Saint-R&eacute;my, 7 December 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Yesterday I sent off by post three packages, containing
    studies which I hope will reach you safely. <label content="art.supplies">I have to thank you
    for 10 meters of canvas which have just arrived.</label></p>

    <p>Among the studies you will find the following which are for
    Mother and our sister: <art id=0711>&ldquo;Olives&rdquo;</art>,
    <art id=0483>&ldquo;Bedroom&rdquo;</art>, <art id=0619>&ldquo;Reaper&rdquo;</art>,
    <art id=0625>&ldquo;Ploughing&rdquo;</art>, <art id=0743>&ldquo;Wheat Field with
    Cypresses&rdquo;</art>, &ldquo;Orchard in Blossom&rdquo;,
    <art id=0525>&ldquo;Portrait&rdquo;</art>. The rest are mostly studies of autumn,
    and I think that the best is <art id=0637>the yellow mulberry tree
    against a bright blue sky</art> - then <art id=0642>the study of the
    house and the park</art>, of which there are <art id=0643>two variations</art>. The
    studies, size 30 canvases, were not yet dry, and will follow
    later. They are giving me a lot of trouble, and sometimes I
    think they are very ugly, sometimes they seem good to me;
    perhaps you will have the same impression when you see them.
    There are a dozen of them, so it is more considerable than what
    I have just sent.</p>

    <p>I have gone on working outside till now in spite of the
    cold, and I think it is doing me good, and the work too.</p>

    <p>The last study I did is <art id=0657>a view of the village, where they
    were at work - under some enormous plane trees - repairing the
    pavements. So there are heaps of sand, stones and gigantic
    trunks - the leaves yellowing and here and there you get a
    glimpse of a house front and small figures</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.loneliness">I think of you and Jo very often, but feeling as though
    there were an enormous distance between here and Paris and it
    was years since I saw you</label>. I hope you are well. For myself I
    have nothing to complain of, I am feeling absolutely normal, so
    to speak, but without an idea for the future, and really I do
    not know what is going to happen, and perhaps I rather avoid
    facing this question, feeling that I can do nothing about
    it.</p>

    <p>I have also finished <art id=0648>the copy of the &ldquo;Diggers&rdquo;
    or nearly so</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">You will see that there are no more impastos in the big
    studies. I prepare the thing with a sort of wash of essence,
    and then proceed with strokes or hatchings in colour with
    spaces between them. That gives atmosphere and you use less
    paint.</label></p>

    <p>If I want to send this letter off today, I must hurry, so a
    handshake in thought and kindest regards to Jo.</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
