  <body>
    <p>My dear friend Russell,</p>

    <p>Today I am sending you a little roll of photographs of
    pictures by Millet, which you may not know.</p>

    <p>However this may be, the purpose is to remind you of myself
    and my brother.</p>

    <p>Do you know that my brother has got married in the meantime,
    and that he is now expecting his first child? Let's hope all
    goes well - he has a very nice Dutch wife.</p>

    <p>How much it pleases me to write you after such a long
    silence! Do you remember when we met our friend Gauguin almost
    at the same time - I think you were the first, and I the
    second?</p>

    <p>He is still struggling on - alone, or nearly alone, like the
    brave fellow he is. I feel sure you have not forgotten him.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I assure you that he and I are still friends, but perhaps
    you are not unaware that I am ill, and that I have had serious
    nervous crises and delirium more than once. This was the cause
    of our parting company, he and I, for I had to go into a
    lunatic asylum.</label> But, before that, how many times we spoke of
    you!</p>

    <p>At the moment Gauguin is still with one of my fellow
    countrymen by the name of De Haan, and De Haan praises him
    highly, and does not think it at all bad to be with him.</p>

    <p>You will find [an] article about some canvases I have at the
    exhibition of the Vingtistes. I assure you that I owe much to
    the things Gauguin told me on the subject of drawing, and I
    have the highest respect for the way he loves nature. For in my
    opinion he is worth even more as a man than as an artist.</p>

    <p>And is everything going well with you? And are you still
    working hard?</p>

    <p>Though it is not pleasant to be ill, yet I have no right to
    complain, for it seems to me that nature sees to it that
    disease is a means of putting us on our legs again and of
    healing us, rather than an absolute evil.</p>

    <p>If you should go to Paris, please go and take a canvas of
    mine at my brother's if you will stick to the idea of someday
    getting together a collection for your native country.</p>

    <p>You will remember that I have already told you it is my
    great desire to give you one for this purpose. How is our
    friend MacKnight? If he is still with you, and if there are
    others with you whom I have had the pleasure of meeting, please
    remember me to them.</p>

    <p>Above all give my kind regards to Mrs. Russell, and believe
    me, with a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent van Gogh</p>

    <p>[Unlike all the other letters to Russell, this letter is
    written in French.]</p>
