  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your last letter. I am very glad that you and Jo
    are well and I think of you very often. What you tell me about
    a publication of coloured lithographs with a text on Monticelli
    is very interesting. Frankly, it gave me very great pleasure,
    and I shall be very curious to see them someday. I hope that
    they will reproduce in colour the bouquet of flowers you have,
    for as to colour, that is a thing of the first order. Someday I
    should very much like to do a plate or two in this style
    myself, from my canvases. For instance, I am working on a
    picture this moment,<art id=0655> women gathering olives, which would lend
    itself to that, I think.</art></p>

    <p>These are the colours: the ground is violet, and farther
    off, yellow ochre; the olives with bronze trunks have
    grey-green foliage, the sky is entirely pink, and three small
    figures pink too. The whole in a very discreet colour scheme.</p>

    <p>It is a canvas done from memory after <art id=0654>the study of the same
    size made on the spot, because I want something far away, like
    a vague memory softened by time</art>. There are only two notes of
    pink and green, which harmonize together, neutralize each
    other, and form a contrast too. I shall probably do two or
    three copies, for after all it is the result of half a dozen
    studies of olives.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I think that probably I shall hardly do any more things in
    impasto; it is the result of the quiet, secluded life that I am
    leading, and I am all the better for it. Fundamentally I am not
    so violent as all that, and at last I <i>myself</i> feel
    calmer.</label></p>

    <p>Perhaps you will also see it in the canvas for the
    Vingtistes, which I sent off yesterday;<art id=0737> the Field of wheat at
    sunrise</art>. You will get <art id=0484>the &ldquo;Bedroom&rdquo;</art> at the same
    time. I put in two drawings as well. I am curious to know what
    you will say about the &ldquo;Wheat Field&rdquo;; perhaps it
    needs to be looked at for some time. However, I hope you will
    write me soon whether it has arrived in good condition, if you
    find half an hour to spare next week.</p>

    <p>I am quite resigned to staying here next year, because I
    think that my work is getting on a little. And because of my
    long stay, I feel the country here differently than I should
    some other place - good ideas are beginning to germinate a
    little now, and we must let them develop. And then I should not
    have strayed so far from my idea of looking for something in
    the country of Tartarin. I have a great wish to do the
    cypresses again and the Alps, and when making long trips in all
    directions I have often carefully noted some subjects, and I
    know good places for when the fine weather comes. Then if I
    leave here, I think there would be hardly any advantage from
    the point of view of expense, and the success of my work is
    even more doubtful if I leave. I have had a letter from
    Gauguin, again very nice, a letter steeped in the nearness of
    the sea; I think he ought to do some fine things, a bit
    wild.</p>

    <p>You tell me not to worry <i>too</i> much and that better
    days will yet come for me. I must tell you that these better
    days have already begun for me, as soon as I get a glimpse of
    the possibility of completing my work in some way or other, so
    that you would have a series of really sympathetic
    Proven&ccedil;al studies, which will somehow be linked, I
    hope, with our distant memories of our youth in Holland, and so
    I am giving myself a treat by doing the<art id=0656> &ldquo;Women Gathering
    Olives&rdquo;</art> again for Mother and our sister.</p>

    <p>And if I could one day prove that I have not impoverished
    the family, that would comfort me. For now I am still full of
    remorse at spending money with no return. But as you say,
    patience and work are the only chance of getting away from
    that.</p>

    <p>However, I often think that if I had done as you did, if I
    had stayed with Goupils', if I had confined myself to selling
    pictures, I should have done better. For in business, even if
    you yourself do not produce, you make others produce. Just now
    so many artists need support from the dealers, and only rarely
    do they find it.</p>

    <p>The money which M. Peyron had is used up, and he even
    advanced me 10 francs some days ago, and in the course of the
    month I shall surely need another 10, and I think it is
    right to give something to the servants here and to the porter
    at New Year's, which will make another 10 francs or so.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">As for winter clothes, I haven't got anything much, as you
    will understand, but they are warm enough and then we can wait
    till spring for that. If I go out, it is to work, so I put on
    what is most worn, and I have a velvet jacket and trousers for
    wearing here.</label> In the spring, if I am here, I intend to go and
    do some pictures in Arles as well, and if I get something new
    at about that time, it will be enough.</p>

    <p>I am enclosing an order for canvas and paints, but I still
    have some, and it can wait till next month if this is already
    too much.</p>

    <p>I remember the picture by Manet you speak of. The
    &ldquo;Portrait of a Man&rdquo; by Puvis de Chavannes has
    always remained the ideal in figure to me, an old man reading a
    yellow novel, and beside him a rose and some watercolour
    brushes in a glass of water - and the &ldquo;Portrait of a
    Lady&rdquo; that he had at the same exhibition, a woman already
    old, but exactly as Michelet felt, There is no such thing as an
    old woman. These are consoling things, to see modern life as
    something bright, in spite of its inevitable griefs.</p>

    <p>Last year around this time I certainly did not think that I
    should ever get over it as much as this.</p>

    <p>Give kind regards to Isa&auml;cson if you see him,
    and to Bernard.</p>

    <p>I am sorry not to be able to send the &ldquo;Olive
    Trees&rdquo; just now, but it is drying so badly that it must
    wait. I think that it would be a good idea to send for our
    sister in January. Ah, if she should get married, it would be a
    good thing.</p>

    <p>I shake your hand in thought. I am again going to work a
    little outside: there is a mistral. Toward sunset it generally
    grows a little calmer, then there are superb sky effects of
    pale citron, and the mournful pines with their silhouettes
    standing out in relief against it with exquisite black lace
    effects. Sometimes the sky is red, sometimes of an extremely
    delicate neutral tone, and again pale citron, but neutralized
    by a delicate lilac.</p>

    <p>I have <art id=0652>an evening effect of another pine tree against pink
    and greenish-yellow</art>. Anyway, you will soon see those canvases,
    the first of which - the &ldquo;Wheat Field&rdquo; - has just
    started. Goodbye, I hope for only a little while. Kindest
    regards to Jo.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
