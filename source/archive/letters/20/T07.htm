    <p>Letter T 07<br>
     Paris, 8 May 1889<br>
    </p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Only a few words in a hurry to thank you for your last
    letter, and to tell you that I don't look upon your going to
    St. R&eacute;my as a <i>retreat</i>, as you say, but
    simply as a temporary rest cure in order that you may come back
    after a short while with renewed strength. I remember seeing
    something a long time ago which struck me very much. In the Rue
    des Petits Carreaux (Little Tiles Street) I saw a very heavy
    dray which had to go up the incline of that street. The
    coachman whipped the four horses with redoubled lashes, but
    nevertheless they absolutely refused to take another step
    forward. So he let them turn around; and when he had gone back
    to the bottom of the street, he turned around again, almost
    without giving them a moment's rest, and went up to the top of
    the street without difficulty.</p>

    <p>You would greatly oblige me by letting me know how you are
    treated in the establishment and how the food is, etc. Mr.
    Salles spoke very well of what he had seen. This gentleman has
    been extremely kind; he wrote me a long letter to give an
    account of his visit. <sup>1</sup> As I cannot tell from your
    telegram whether you have gone, I do not know whether he
    accompanied you, as he proposed to do.</p>

    <p>There is a very fine picture by Raffaelli at the Salon, two
    absinthe drinkers. I think him most forceful when he paints
    such d&eacute;class&eacute;s, though the portrait
    of the two young girls in white is perhaps the best portrait at
    the Salon. Zorn has a picture of girls bathing on the beach,
    which you remember. There is a &ldquo;Birth of Christ&rdquo; by
    Uhde, a triptych, in which there is a pretty sentiment.
    Otherwise there is very little of interest in the whole bazaar.
    I quite agree with you that one should not believe exclusively
    in impressionism, yet it is a fact that there is that
    individual something in it which is missing in nearly
    everything to be seen at the Salon.</p>

    <p>I hope to see you soon, and keep well. A cordial
    handshake.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>
