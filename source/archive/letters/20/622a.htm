  <body>
    <p>My dear friends, Mr. and Mrs. Ginoux,</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I do not know whether you remember - I think it rather
    strange that it is nearly a year since Mrs. Ginoux was taken
    ill at the same time as myself; and that it remained the same
    until just before Christmas - for several days in the current
    year I had rather a bad attack, however it passed off very
    quickly; I have not had any for a week.</label> So, my dear friends, as
    now and then we suffer together, this makes me think of what
    Mrs. Ginoux said - &ldquo;When you are friends, you are friends
    for a long time&hellip;&rdquo; Personally I believe that the
    adversities one meets with in the ordinary course of life do us
    as much good as harm. The very complaint that makes one ill
    today, overwhelming one with discouragement, that same thing -
    once the disease has passed off - gives us the energy to get up
    and to want to be completely recovered tomorrow.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.despair">I assure you that last year I almost hated the idea of
    regaining my health - of only feeling somewhat better for a
    shorter or longer time - always living in fear of relapses - I
    almost hated the idea, I tell you - so little did I feel
    inclined to begin again. Often I said to myself that I
    preferred that there be nothing further, that this be the end.
    Ah well - it would seem that we are not the masters of this -
    of our existence - it seems that what matters is that one
    should learn to want to go on living, even when suffering. Oh,
    I feel so cowardly in this respect; even when my health has
    returned, I am still afraid.</label> So who am I to encourage others,
    you will say, for actually this is my style. Well, it is only
    to tell you, my dear friends, that I hope so ardently, and even
    dare believe that Mrs. Ginoux's illness will be of very short
    duration, and that she will rise from her sickbed a much
    stronger fellow, but she knows only too well how fond we all
    are of her, and how much we wish to see her in good health. In
    my own case my disease has done me good - it would be
    ungrateful not to acknowledge it. It has made me easier in my
    mind, and is wholly different from what I expected and
    imagined; this year I have had better luck than I dared hope
    for.</p>

    <p>But if I had not been so well cared for, if people had not
    been so good to me as they have been, I am convinced I should
    have dropped dead or lost my reason completely. Business is
    business, and in the same way duty is duty, and therefore it is
    only fair that I go back to see my brother soon, but I assure
    you that it will be hard for me to leave the South; I say this
    to all of you who have become my friends - my friends for a
    long time.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">I have forgotten to thank you for the olives you sent me
    some time ago, they were excellent; I shall bring back the
    boxes in a little while&hellip;</label></p>

    <p>So I write you this letter, my dear friends, in order to try
    and distract our dear patient for a moment, so that she may
    once again show us her habitual smile and give pleasure to all
    who know her. As I told you, within a fortnight I hope to visit
    you, wholly recovered.</p>

    <p>Diseases exist to remind us that we are not made of wood,
    and it seems to me this is the bright side of it all.</p>

    <p>And after that one dreams of taking up one's daily work
    again, being less afraid of obstacles, with a new stock of
    serenity; and even at parting one will tell oneself, &ldquo;And
    when you are friends, you are friends for a long time&rdquo; -
    for this is the way to leave each other.</p>

    <p>Well, we shall be seeing each other soon, and my best wishes
    for Mrs. Ginoux's swift recovery.</p>

    <p>Believe me</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
