    <p>Letter T32<br>
     Paris, 23 April 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">Your silence proves to us that you are still suffering, and
    I feel urgently impelled to tell you, my dear brother, that Jo
    and I suffer too because we know you are ill. Oh how happy we
    should be if we could do something for you that might give you
    solace. Dr. Peyron writes us that we are not to be uneasy, and
    that this crisis, though it is lasting longer than the others,
    will pass off too.</label> If the distance were not so great, I should
    certainly have gone to see you, and I count on it that, as soon
    as you feel the need of it, you will say the word, and I shall
    come at once.</p>

    <p>Last week it was already a year since I got married. How
    time flies. We have every reason to be satisfied with this
    year. I do not forget that you insisted on my getting married,
    and you were right, for I am much happier. It is true that my
    dear wife is not like everybody, and that I was marvelously
    lucky when I found her. We understand each other very well, and
    our home is pleasant. The little one particularly gives Jo a
    lot of work, but he is growing surprisingly. He is of a nervous
    disposition but very gentle. He will stay awake for hours
    without crying; he is beginning to smile and to make sounds
    that must be the beginning of speaking. It would do you good to
    see him and play with him.</p>

    <p>It is our intention to pass the two holidays at Whitsuntide
    with Pissarro, who has invited us. He is going to London this
    summer to work there.</p>

    <p>Your pictures at the exhibition are having a lot of success.
    The other day Diaz stopped me in the street and said, Give your
    brother my compliments and tell him that his pictures are
    highly remarkable. Monet said that your pictures were the best
    of all in the exhibition. A lot of other artists have spoken to
    me about them. Serret came to our house to see the other
    pictures, and he was enraptured. He said that if he had no
    style of his own in which he could still express some things,
    he would change his course and go seek what you are seeking.
    Lauzet is back; he was not able to call on you, for his mother
    and sister, who lived in Marseilles, have come to stay with
    him, and he had to help them move, and he didn't have a penny
    to spend on a detour.</p>

    <p>My dear brother, remember that nothing in the world would
    give me greater pleasure than knowing you happy and in good
    health, and that every day I pray for your speedy recovery.</p>

    <p>Be courageous, and a cordial handshake from Jo and from your
    brother who loves you.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>
