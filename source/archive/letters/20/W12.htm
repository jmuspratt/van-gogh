    <p>My dear sister:</p>

    <p>If I didn't write to you in a hurry this Sunday morning,
    while the canvases I have started are drying a little in the
    sun, I should have to wait still longer before answering your
    kind letter.</p>

    <p>I hope all is well with you, and with Mother too - I think
    of you both very often. I was unable to foresee at the time,
    when I left Nuenen to go to Antwerp, that the course of events
    would keep me away for so long, and at such a distance. Perhaps
    this is the reason that my thoughts go back to those parts
    involuntarily so often, and then it seems to me that I am
    carrying on the same work that I left unfinished there, seeing
    that so many things in nature are parallel.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">Though it is with an obstinate ingratitude that I feel my
    health gradually returning, the fact is that I am quite well;
    but, as I told you, my inclination to take up the joys of life
    again can hardly be called strong.</label></p>

    <p>I have just finished <art id=0712>a landscape representing an orchard of
    olive trees with grey leaves, somewhat like those of the
    willows in colour, their violet shadows lying on the sunny
    sand.</art> And <art id=0719>another one too, which represents a
    field of wheat turning yellow, surrounded by blackberry bushes
    and green shrubs. At the end of the field there is a little
    house with a tall somber cypress which stands out against the
    far-off hills with their violet-like and bluish tones, and
    against a sky the colour of forget-me-nots with pink streaks,
    whose pure hues form a contrast with the scorched ears, which
    are already heavy, and have the warm tones of a bread crust.</art></p>

    <p>I have still <art id=0611>another one in which a wheat field on the slope
    of the hills is all devastated and smashed to earth by the
    pouring rain and the rushing water of a cloudburst.</art></p>

    <p>It seems to me that the people of this country work a good
    deal less than the peasants at home; one hardly sees any
    cattle, and the fields make a much more deserted impression
    than those in our country. In my opinion this is very
    deplorable, all the more so as nature here is the reverse of
    stingy, and the air is so pure and healthy. So what one should
    like to see is a more energetic race of men. The cases where
    doing nothing becomes doing wrong do not seem to be exceptional
    here. Aren't there heaps of honest workers without enough bread
    in the North because people there work so much that work is no
    longer held in high regard. I don't mean to say that this is
    always the case, but surely there is something of the kind.
    Well, the farms here would produce three times as much as they
    do now if they were well kept, and the whole land too if it
    were sufficiently manured. And if the country here should
    produce three times as much, it might feed a lot more
    people.</p>

    <p>Now I think you asked me whether always supposing that love
    is a bacillus, which I am unable to affirm or to prove, a fact
    I request you please not to lose sight of, I think you asked me
    whether there are persons who have said bacillus, and others
    who do not, or whether on the contrary it is a fatal and
    universal malady. There again I am pretty incompetent to form a
    well-founded, clear opinion. But in my estimation it is
    probable that, if somebody - let's say you for the sake of
    argument - were convinced he did not have it, it would perhaps
    be sensible of such a person to inoculate herself or himself
    with the aforesaid bacillus according to the method of Pasteur
    or someone else. Joking apart, I am of the opinion that a man
    or a woman ought to be desperately in love with something or
    somebody, and the only precaution one might be able to take is
    to do it in a certain way according to one's ideas, and not in
    any other way.</p>

    <p>As to knowing one's own mind in matters of this kind - alas,
    we know ourselves so little.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact I am inclined to believe that women are
    apt to take the offensive in these things; that those among
    them who are wise, or rather who have the truest and surest
    instincts, do not wait for somebody else to love them before
    they fall in love themselves&mdash;which (and I am disposed to
    think there are good reasons for this) seems to them to be the
    essential thing.</p>

    <p>And finally, it is more than probable that, even after
    having inoculated oneself with the attenuated bacillus of the
    right virus, well chosen and of the correct dosage, and thus
    having become all the more secure against contagion, at least
    if one has not caught the malady yet, that does not definitely
    prevent one from catching it, whereas, if one already has it,
    one cannot catch it again.</p>

    <p>I am sort of longing for news from Theo, who seems to be
    rather absorbed in his honeymoon, which is a very good thing.
    Last week he sent me a consignment of paints and canvases, but
    a month has gone by since I received a letter from him. It is a
    great consolation to me to know that he is no longer living
    alone. His wife wrote me a very good letter [See Letter T08]
    some time ago, which proved to me that she is a very serious
    young woman. She will need this quality now and for a long time
    to come, for Theo's life is rather complicated because of his
    duty toward Boussod Valadon &amp; Co. As for her, she will
    learn to prefer life with him to life without him without being
    obliged to change too much, or to forget all the things she
    already knew in Holland.</p>

    <p>Now I am going out to work a little, so I wish you all
    prosperity and health, you and Mother too. With a kiss in
    thought,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
