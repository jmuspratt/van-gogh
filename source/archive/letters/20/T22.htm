    <p>Letter T22<br>
     Paris, 22 December 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I received your package containing your <art id=0737>wheat field</art>
    and <art id=0482>the two</art> <art id=0484>bedrooms</art>.
    I particularly like the last one, which is like a bouquet of
    flowers in its colouring. It has a very great intensity of
    colour. The wheat field has perhaps more poetry in it; it is
    like a memory of something one has once seen. Tangui is framing
    it at the moment, and on January 3 everything will go to
    Brussels. Now there is something which gave me a lot of
    pleasure. Mr. Lauzet, the lithographer of Monticelli's
    pictures, came to see me at my home. He came to see ours, and
    he thought them very fine. As regards the flowers, he doesn't
    think he can reproduce them, for the slabs are monochrome, and
    he doesn't think he will be able to render the effect of that
    picture in a single colour. He will start with the
    &ldquo;Italian Woman.&rdquo; But what pleased him most were
    your canvases and drawings; oh, my dear fellow, that man
    understands them!</p>

    <p>A long time ago now he saw some of them at Tangui's, and he
    was really glad to see everything I have here; while going
    through the drawings he came across a gatherer of fallen apples
    which he liked very much, and I made him a present of it, for I
    think you would have done the same. Next day he came to see me
    again at the shop to ask me whether it was not possible to have
    another drawing which you did at the very beginning of your
    stay at St. R&eacute;my. On the left there is a small
    cluster of somber trees against a sky with a waxing moon, on
    the right a low wooden gate. He told me that he could not get
    this drawing out of his mind, that it was even finer than the
    drawings by V. Hugo, which he liked very much, and so on. I
    proposed to him to exchange it for a lithograph from his
    Monticelli album, and he accepted immediately. The album is
    still far from completed, but he will finish it. Cottier and
    Reid have subscribed for several copies, so that his printing
    expenses are covered. He has got ready sixteen of the
    twenty-five lithographs he intends to make.</p>

    <p>I think he has been most successful in that head of a child
    which we saw at La Roquette's that time. The artist made a very
    sympathetic impression on me. He is from the South and has
    something of the Spaniard about him, a pale face with a black
    beard, but at the same time he has something gentle like an
    English poet. It is a great pity that he has not done any slabs
    in different colours, for now one can get no idea of the force
    of the colours, which Monticelli was one of the first to use,
    availing himself of a contrast in order to arrive at a strong
    effect while preserving harmony. The slabs I have seen are like
    etchings on stone, as Marvy made them.</p>

    <p>You say that at times you think you would have done better
    to have remained a merchant, but do not say such things. Take
    Gauguin, for instance. I am fully aware of his talent, and I am
    fully aware of what he wants to do, but I have not seen my way
    to selling anything whatever for him, and yet I have all kinds
    of pictures of his. The public is most rebellious about things
    that are not made in &ldquo;perfect order.&rdquo; It is obvious
    that Gauguin, who is half Inca, half European, superstitious
    like the former, and advanced in his ideas like a number of the
    latter, cannot work in the same manner every day. He is very
    unhappy because it has not been possible to find something for
    him on which he can live. His most recent pictures are less
    saleable than those of last year. Last week he wrote to tell me
    that one of his children fell out of a window, and was picked
    up nearly dead. And yet they hope to save him. He would do
    anything to get a little money, but I am unable to procure it.
    <sup>1</sup> Pissarro too is at his wits end. He is working
    like a slave. He made a very pretty fan for Jo. Peasant women
    running about in the fields with a rainbow in the background.
    So far he has not see that gentleman at Auvers, at least he
    does not write anything on the subject; the best thing for you
    would be to come and stay with us in the spring, and then go
    into the country yourself to see whether you can't find a
    boarding house to your liking. We certainly ought to be glad
    that you are so much better in comparison with the same period
    last year. At the time I was afraid you would not recover. We
    are expecting Wil on January 2; she is going to stay with us
    for a month. I agree with you that it would be delightful if
    she married, and the man who got her would find a charming
    wife.</p>

    <p>Cor writes often from the Transvaal. Life over there can
    hardly be very amusing. There are no plants or flowers. When
    there is not a torrid heat, it rains in such a way that the
    whole country is swamped. One day is absolutely like another,
    which is why, he says, he detests Sundays and other times of
    leisure.</p>

    <p>Here the weather is abominable, cold and grey, and nearly
    everybody is ill. How are you? Is it as cold in your part of
    the country as it was at Arles? I am curious to see your olive
    trees; I expect they are beautiful. The sunflowers were on show
    at Tangui's this week, and made a very good effect. Your
    pictures brighten Tangui's shop; Father Tangui is very fond of
    them, but he does not sell the other things any more than
    yours. I like the two drawings you sent me very much. Do you
    want me to send some of them to Brussels? Please let me have
    your reply by return mail, for there is no time to lose about
    the framing. Jo sends her kindest regards; she is very well,
    relatively speaking. I hope you will paint the portrait of the
    little one next spring. I shake your hand cordially, and I hope
    you will have a nice New Year's Eve.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>

    <p>I just received your postcard; the pictures will be ready in
    time.</p>
