  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Enclosed is one of Mother's letters, of course you know all
    the news in it. I think that Cor is very smart to go there.
    [Their youngest brother was going to the Transvaal.]</p>

    <p>It's different from staying in Europe, down there you don't
    have to put up with the influence of our big cities, which are
    so old that everything in them seems to be tottering and in its
    dotage. Instead of seeing his vital strength and native and
    natural energy evaporate in circumlocution, it's possible that
    he might be far happier distancing himself from our
    society.</p>

    <p>He should do this without delay and act with honesty as he
    has been taught, and not hesitate to accept the situation.
    However, it's not to acquaint you with all this news that I am
    sending you this letter, which you know already.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.mother">But it is to let you see how firm and regular the
    handwriting is, remarkable enough when you think that what she
    says is really true, that she is a mother of almost seventy.
    And just as you already wrote me, and our sister too, that she
    seems to have grown younger, I see it myself in this clear
    handwriting and the very clear logic in what she writes, and
    the simplicity with which she appreciates facts.</label></p>

    <p>I think now that this growing young again has come to her
    just because she is glad that you are married; she has wanted
    it for such a long time, and I congratulate you because your
    marriage enables you and Jo to have the rather rare pleasure of
    seeing your mother grow young again. It is really for that
    reason that I am sending you the letter. For my dear boy, one
    sometimes needs a reminder later on, and it happens so
    fortunately that just at the moment when she will have the
    great sorrow of parting with Cor - it will be hard on her, that
    - she will be comforted by knowing you are married. If
    possible, you must not wait a whole year before going back to
    Holland, for she will be longing to see you again, you and your
    wife.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">At the same time, since you have married a Dutchwoman,
    within a few years' time - sooner or later - it may revive the
    business relations with Amsterdam or The Hague.</label></p>

    <p>Well, once more, I have not seen a letter of Mother's
    showing so much inner serenity and calm contentment as this -
    not for many years. And I am sure that this comes from your
    marriage. They say that pleasing your parents assures long
    life.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">Thank you very much for the package of colours. Subtract
    them from the order sent since, but if you could manage it,
    <i>not</i> for the quantity of white.</label> Thank you also very
    heartily for the Shakespeare. It will help me not to forget the
    little English I know, but above all it is so fine. I have
    begun to read the series of which I knew least, which formerly,
    distracted by other things or not having the time, I could not
    read; the series of the kings: I have already read Richard II,
    Henry IV and half of Henry V. I read without wondering if the
    ideas of the people of those times were different from our own,
    or what would become of them if you confronted them with
    republican and socialist beliefs and so on. But what touches
    me, as in some novelists of our day, is that the voices of
    these people, which in Shakespeare's case reach us from a
    distance of several centuries, do not seem unfamiliar to us. It
    is so much alive that you think you know them and see the
    thing.</p>

    <p>And so what Rembrandt has alone or almost alone among
    painters, that tenderness of gaze which we see, whether it's in
    <art id=emmaus>the &ldquo;Men of Emmaus&rdquo;</art> or in <art id=jbride>the &ldquo;Jewish
    Bride&rdquo;</art> or in some such strange angelic figure as the
    picture you have had the good fortune to see, that heartbroken
    tenderness, that glimpse of a super-human infinitude that seems
    so natural there - in many places you come upon it in
    Shakespeare too. And then above all he is full of portraits,
    grave or gay, like &ldquo;Six&rdquo; and like the
    &ldquo;Traveller,&rdquo; and like &ldquo;Saskia.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>What a good idea of Victor Hugo's son to translate all this
    into French, so that it will be within everyone's reach.</p>

    <p>When I think of the impressionists and of all the problems
    of art nowadays, what lessons there are for us in that very
    thing. And so the idea came to me from what I have just been
    reading that the impressionists are right a thousand times
    over, yet even then they must think over long and well whether
    it follows from this that they have the right or the duty to
    take justice into their own hands.</p>

    <p>If they dare call themselves primitives, certainly they
    would do well to learn a little to be primitives as <i>men</i>
    before pronouncing the word primitive as a title, which would
    give them a right to anything whatever. But as for those who
    may be the cause of the impressionists' unhappiness, well, they
    are in a pretty serious predicament, even though they make
    light of it.</p>

    <p>And then it looks as though fighting a battle seven times a
    week really could not go on.</p>

    <p>It is amazing how <i>L'Abbesse de Jouarre,</i> when you
    think of it, holds its own even beside Shakespeare.</p>

    <p>I think that Renan treated himself to that, so as to be able
    for once to use beautiful words plentifully and pleasurably,
    for the words are beautiful there.</p>

    <p>In order that you have some idea of what I am doing, I am
    sending you a dozen drawings today, all from canvases I am
    working on.</p>

    <p>The latest one I've started is the <art id=1546>&ldquo;Wheat
    Field,&rdquo; in which there is a little reaper and a big sun.</art>
    <art id=0618>The canvas is all yellow except for the wall and the background
    of violet-tinted hills</art>. <art id=0618>The canvas which is almost the same in
    subject is different in colouring, being greyish-green with a
    white and blue sky.</art></p>

    <p>How often I think of Reid when I am reading Shakespeare, and
    how often I have thought of him while I was worse than I am
    now. Thinking that I was far, far too hard on him and too
    discouraging when I claimed that it was better to care for the
    painters than for the pictures.</p>

    <p>It is not within my power to make distinctions like this,
    even faced with the problem which we see our living friends
    suffering under, the lack of enough money to live on and to pay
    for their paints, and on the other hand the high prices paid
    for the canvases of dead painters. I was reading in a newspaper
    a letter from a collector of Greek things to one of his
    friends, in which this phrase occurred: &ldquo;You who love
    nature, I who love everything the hand of man has made, this
    difference in our tastes is basically a unity.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And I thought that this was better than my argument.</p>

    <p><art id=0717>I have a canvas of cypresses with some ears of wheat, some
    poppies, a blue sky like a piece of multicoloured Scotch plaid; the former painted with a
    thick impasto like the Monticellis, and the wheat field with the sun, which
    represents the extreme heat, very thick too; I think that these
    would make it more or less clear to him that he could not lose
    much by remaining friends with us. But that is true for us as
    well, and just because it <i>was perhaps right</i> to
    disapprove of his method, we must on <i>our</i> side take a
    step toward reconciliation.</p>

    <p>Anyhow, I dare not write now for fear of saying too many
    silly things, but when I am more certain of my pen, I should
    very much like to write to him someday.</p>

    <p>I still have some canvases in Arles which were not dry when
    I left. I very much want to go and get them one of these days
    in order to send them to you; there are half a dozen. The
    drawings seem to me to have little colour this time, and the
    too-smooth paper must have caused it.</p>

    <p>The &ldquo;Weeping Tree&rdquo; and <art id=0519>the courtyard of the
    &ldquo;Hospital at Arles&rdquo;</art> have more
    colour, but all the same this will give you an idea of what I
    am doing. The canvas of the &ldquo;Reaper&rdquo; is going to be
    something like the <art id=0422>&ldquo;Sower&rdquo;</art> of last year.</p>

    <p>How fine Zola's books will continue to be, just because
    there is life in them.</p>

    <p>What has life in it too is that Mother is glad that you are
    married, and I think that this cannot be unpleasant to
    yourselves, you and Jo. But the separation from Cor will be
    harder on her than one can imagine. It is just in learning to
    suffer without complaint, in learning to look on pain without
    repugnance, that you risk vertigo, and yet it is possible, yet
    you may even catch a glimpse of a vague likelihood that on the
    other side of life we shall see good reason for the existence
    of pain, which seen from here sometimes so fills the whole
    horizon that it takes on the proportions of a hopeless deluge.
    We know very little about this, about its proportions, and it
    is better to look at a wheat field, even in the form of a
    picture.</p>

    <p>I shake hands with you both, and I hope to hear from you
    soon. Good health to both of you.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
