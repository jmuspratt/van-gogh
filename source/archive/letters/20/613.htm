  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">Enclosed I send you a list of paints which again I want as
    soon as possible.</label></p>

    <p>You gave me great pleasure by sending those Millets. I am
    working at them zealously. Because I haven't been seeing
    anything artistic, I was getting slack, and this has revived
    me. I have finished <art id=0647>the &ldquo;Veill&eacute;e&rdquo;</art> and am working
    on <art id=0648>the &ldquo;Diggers&rdquo;</art> and <art id=0649>the &ldquo;Man Putting on
    His Jacket,&rdquo;</art> size 30 canvases, and <art id=0690>the &ldquo;Sower,&rdquo;</art>
    smaller. The &ldquo;Veill&eacute;e&rdquo; is in a colour scheme of
    violets and tender lilacs with the light of the lamp pale
    lemon, then the orange glow of the fire and the man in red
    ochre. You will see it; it seems to me that painting from these
    drawings of Millet's is much more <i>translating them into
    another tongue</i> than copying them.</p>

    <p>Besides that, I have <art id=0650>a rain effect going</art> and <art id=0652>an evening effect with
    some big pines</art>. And also <art id=0651>one of the falling leaves</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">I am very well - except for a great depression sometimes,
    but I am feeling well, much better than last winter, and even
    better than when I came here, and still better than in
    Paris.</label></p>

    <p>Also in my work my ideas are becoming - it seems to me -
    more stable. But then I do not quite know if you will like what
    I am doing now. For in spite of what you said in your last
    letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities,
    the fact is that I feel strongly inclined to seek style, if you
    like, but by that I mean a more virile, deliberate drawing. I
    can't help it if that makes me more like Bernard or Gauguin.
    But I am inclined to think that in the end you will come to
    like it.</p>

    <p>For, yes, you must feel the whole of a country - isn't that
    what distinguishes a C&eacute;zanne from anything else?
    And Guillaumin whom you cite, he has so much style and such a
    personal manner of drawing.</p>

    <p>Anyhow, I will do the best I can. Now that most of the
    leaves have fallen, the countryside is more like the North, and
    then I realize that if I returned to the North, I should see it
    more clearly than before.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.nightmares">Fortunately those abominable nightmares have stopped
    tormenting me.</label> I hope to go to Arles one of these days.</p>

    <p>I should so much like Jo to see the
    &ldquo;Veill&eacute;e.&rdquo; I think I shall send you a
    package in a little while, but it is drying very badly because
    of the dampness of the studio. Here there is hardly any cellar
    or foundation to the houses, and you feel the damp more than in
    the North.</p>

    <p>Those at home will have moved by now. I will add six
    canvases for them to the next package. Is it necessary to have
    them framed? - perhaps not, because they are not worth it.
    Above all do not get the studies that I send from time to time
    framed, we can do that later on, it's no use their taking up
    too much room.</p>

    <p>I have also done a canvas for M. Peyron; <art id=0653>a view of the house
    with a big pine</art>.</p>

    <p>I hope you and Jo continue well.</p>

    <p>I am glad that you are not alone any more and that
    everything is more normal than it used to be.</p>

    <p>Is Gauguin back, and what is Bernard doing?</p>

    <p>Good-by for now. A good handshake for you and Jo and our
    friends, and believe rue,</p>

    <p>Ever yours,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I am trying as much as possible to simplify the list of
    paints - therefore I very often use the ochres as I did in the
    old days. I know quite well that the studies in the last
    package, drawn with long sinuous lines, were not what they
    ought to have been;</label> however I beg you to believe that in
    landscape I am going on trying to mass things by means of a
    drawing style which tries to express the interlocking of the
    masses. Do you happen to remember that landscape by Delacroix -
    &ldquo;Jacob Struggling with the Angel&rdquo;? And there are
    others of his! For instance, the cliffs and those very flowers
    of which you sometimes speak. Bernard has really done some
    perfect things in this respect. Well, don't cultivate a
    prejudice against it too quickly.</p>

    <p>Anyhow, you will see that in a big landscape with some
    pines, trunks of red ochre defined by a black stroke, there is
    already more character than in the previous ones.</p>
