  <body>
    <p>[The <art id=824_V-T_6320>sketch Raising of Lazarus was drawn here.</art></p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">Once more I write to say that my health continues to be
    good, however I feel a bit exhausted by this long attack and I
    dare think that the projected change will refresh my ideas all
    the more.</label></p>

    <p><i>I think the best thing will be for me to go myself to see
    this doctor in the country as soon as possible,</i> then we can
    soon decide if I shall go to stay with him or temporarily at
    the inn; and thus we shall avoid too prolonged a stay in Paris,
    a thing I dread.</p>

    <p>You remember that six months ago I said after an attack that
    if it was repeated I should ask you for a change. We have got
    to this - though I do not feel capable of passing judgment on
    the way they treat the patients, it is enough that I feel that
    what still remains of my wits and of the power to work is
    absolutely in danger, whereas on the contrary, I undertake to
    prove to this doctor of whom you speak that I can still work
    rationally, and he will treat me accordingly, and since he
    likes painting, there is really a chance that a lasting
    friendship will result.</p>

    <p>I do not think that M. Peyron will object to a very prompt
    departure; besides, I tell myself that the pleasure of spending
    some days with you will do me a lot of good.</p>

    <p>And from that time on we can really count on a period of
    comparative health. So do not delay taking the necessary steps
    so that this does not keep dragging on.</p>

    <p>Once there, I can send for my bed, which is in Arles.</p>

    <p>Besides, I should make a change in any case, as I prefer
    being in an asylum where the patients work to this terrible
    idleness here, which really seems to me simply a crime. But
    then, you will tell me that one sees it practically everywhere,
    and that it even abounds in Paris. However that may be, I hope
    we shall see each other again shortly.</p>

    <p>The etchings which you sent me are very fine. On the back of
    this page I have scribbled a sketch after <art id=0677>a painting </art>I have
    done of three figures which are in the background of the
    etching of &ldquo;Lazarus&rdquo;: the dead man and his two
    sisters. The cave and the corpse are white-yellow-violet. The
    woman who takes the handkerchief away from the face of the
    resurrected man has a green dress and orange hair, the other
    has black hair and a gown of striped green and pink. In the
    background a countryside of blue hills, a yellow sunrise.</p>

    <p>Thus the combination of colours would itself suggest the
    same thing which the chiaroscuro of the etching expresses.</p>

    <p>If I should still have at my disposal the model who posed
    for <art id=0508>&ldquo;La Berceuse,&rdquo;</art> and <art id=0540>the other one whose portrait
    after Gauguin's drawing you have just received</art>, I would
    certainly try to make a painting of it in large size, this
    canvas, as these persons are just what I would have dreamed as
    characters. But subjects of this kind aside, when I am back in
    the North, there will always be the study from nature of
    peasants and landscapes.</p>

    <p>As for the order for paints, if I should have to stay here a
    few more days, then please send part of them <i>at
    once</i>. If, however, I am leaving one of these days -
    which I hope - you can quite well keep them in Paris.</p>

    <p>Write me soon in any case: I hope you will have received the
    canvases safely. I have done another one of a nook of greenery,
    which I think has some freshness. I have also tried <art id=0633>a copy of
    the &ldquo;Good Samaritan&rdquo; by Delacroix</art>.</p>

    <p>I think, from a note in the <i>Figaro,</i> that father Quost
    must have a tremendous picture at the Salon.</p>

    <p>Kind regards to your wife, I am looking forward to making
    her acquaintance with great pleasure, and a good handshake in
    thought.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
