    <p>Letter T13<br>
     Paris, 29 July 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I am a little uneasy that you have not received my letter,
    which contained a money order for 100 francs. You usually reply
    as soon as you receive it; if this were not so, I should say
    that you have had no time for it.</p>

    <p>I reproach myself with writing you so seldom, but
    letter-writing is extremely difficult for me lately; I don't
    know what the reason for it is. I received your last
    consignment, which was in perfect condition, and which I think
    extremely beautiful. <sup>1</sup> Are these the things you set
    aside expressly in order to let them dry? - for in most of
    these canvases I find more clarity of expression and such a
    fine general effect. The one with <art id=0609>the underbrush and the trees
    overgrown with ivy</art>, the <art id=0517>Promenade at Arles</art>,
    and <art id=0514>the fields with the gardens in spring</art> are
    very beautiful. These and others too are now mounted on
    stretchers, from which we removed the canvases which were on
    them and which are now at Tangui's. They make a very fine
    showing in the frames. As for Tanguy himself, he likes them
    very much, too. In my opinion you choose such fine subjects for
    your pictures: those trees with their dense foliage full of
    freshness and bathed in sunlight are marvellously good. I
    should be very pleased if you lived in an environment which was
    wholly to your taste, and if you were surrounded by people you
    liked, and who returned your friendship, for you cannot work
    better than you are doing now, and what a number of fine things
    you have turned out!</p>

    <p>It is fortunate that your health is good. Mr. Peyron wrote
    the other day to tell me that he thought your condition
    satisfactory. Let us hope this will get better and better. Jo's
    parents are here at the moment - her mother staying with us,
    her father with Andr&eacute;. It is a nice distraction
    especially for Jo, and it forces her to take exercise, which
    seems to be necessary. She is looking well, only she is a
    little weak. <label content="Theo.health">As for me, I look like a corpse, but I went to see
    Rivet, who gave me all sorts of drugs, which at least do me
    enough good to put a stop to my cough, which was killing me. I
    think it is over now.</label> It is the change of life, and in
    consequence of the way I am being taken care of now I am going
    to regain my strength, as soon as the evil is past. Yesterday
    we went to St. Germain. Oh, how beautiful the countryside is.
    Why do people go and wear themselves out in cities when they
    might breathe wholesome air, which brings life back?</p>

    <p>Do you leave the establishment once in a while now? Write me
    a letter if you can - just tell me how you are. Don't work too
    much.</p>

    <p>A cordial handshake, also from Jo.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
