    <p>Letter T25<br>
     Paris, 22 January 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I felt greatly reassured after hearing that you are feeling
    well, and that the trip to Arles was accomplished without bad
    consequences. I have various things to tell you, which will
    probably please you. In the first place Lauzet came here again
    to see your new canvases, and after he had seen some pictures
    he exclaimed, &ldquo;This is the genuine character of the
    Provence.&rdquo; He who is a native of those parts knows the
    country, and abhors the sugary things the Montenards and the
    others bring back from it. For the rest you will be able to
    talk with him yourself, for last Saturday he went to Marseilles
    for two weeks, and on his return he will do his utmost to drop
    in on you. When you see him you will be so kind as to tell him
    that I have another subscription for his work Monticelli,
    Impressions of an Artist - he will be glad to hear it. Not long
    ago he was at our house in the evening, and we looked through
    the work on Alb. D&uuml;rer's Etchings by
    d'Amand-Durand together. You will see what an interesting
    fellow he is, and what a lot he knows about modern
    literature.</p>

    <p>It seems that the exhibition of the &ldquo;XX&rdquo; at
    Brussels is open; I read in a paper that the canvases which
    arouse the curiosity of the public the most are the open-air
    study by C&eacute;zanne, the landscapes by Sisley, the
    symphonies by Van Gogh and the works of Renoir. For the month
    of March they are now preparing here a new exhibition of the
    impressionists at the pavilion of the &ldquo;Ville de
    Paris.&rdquo; Everyone can send in as many canvases as he
    likes. Guillaumin is going to exhibit his work there too.
    Please think over whether you will exhibit too, and which
    picture you want to send. The exhibition of the
    &ldquo;XX&rdquo; will be closed by that time. I think we can
    wait patiently for success to come; you will surely live to see
    it. It is necessary to get well known without obtruding
    oneself, and it will come of its own accord by reason of your
    beautiful pictures.</p>

    <p>As regards what you write about the future, try to find out
    if it isn't possible to enter into some sort of combination
    with Lauzet. For instance, you might look for a studio for the
    two of you, and then you could take your dinner and sleep at
    our house. As for the furniture, I am afraid that the
    forwarding expenses would be at least equal to what it is
    worth, and I wonder whether it would not be preferable to sell
    it at Arles. I am trying to find out which establishment in
    Holland might be suitable, but I have been told already that
    they are so full up that it is difficult to get admitted. There
    is Gheel in Belgium, but I don't know what one must do to get
    admitted there. In any case I hope that you will come and stay
    with us for a while in order to meet our friends again and to
    see our baby. Fortunately Jo is in very good health; things are
    drawing to a close now, for we hope she is going to have her
    baby at the beginning of February. Wil is much better, and she
    is looking extremely well. I should very much like her to get
    married, but to whom?</p>

    <p>Do you know, when I saw your olive trees again, I admired
    them more and more; <art id=0710>the one with the sunset especially is
    superb</art>. How you have worked since your last
    arrival; it is prodigious. I am anxious to see the other
    Millets. The other day they published in London a collection of
    facsimiles of original drawings by Rembrandt. It is marvelous;
    Seymour Haden is in charge of the supervision of the paintings.
    Unfortunately they are sold at a very high price - 600 francs
    for the collection of 400 prints. Last Sunday Dr. Salles came
    to see us, but unfortunately we had gone out. I should very
    much like to have seen him. I hope to see you soon, take care
    of your health, and be of good heart.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
