    <p>Letter 624 <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>St.-R&eacute;my, 31 January 1890</p>

    <p>Dear Jo,</p>

    <p>It moves me so much that you write to me and are so calm and
    master of yourself on one of your difficult nights. How I am
    longing to get the news that you have come safely through, and
    that your child is living. How happy Theo will be, and a new
    sun will rise inside him when he sees you recovering.</p>

    <p>Forgive me if I warn you that in my opinion recovery takes a
    long time and is no easier than being ill. Our parents knew
    this too, and following them in this might almost seem our
    duty.</p>

    <p>Well, I myself am also thinking of you people these days.<label content="health.mental"> I
    am feeling better, but have again had a few days like the
    others, when I did not know exactly what was going on, and was
    upset <sup>2</sup>.</label></p>

    <p>But you see that the quietness is coming back. I read Theo's
    letter with the enclosed 50 francs along with your letter; he
    writes me things which give me much pleasure. And I hope to
    send him some of my work shortly.</p>

    <p>But how I am longing to hear of the good result of your
    struggle.</p>

    <p>Tell him that I got a nice letter from Gauguin. And if Wil
    is still with you - as I suppose - tell her that I received her
    letter and hope to answer it soon.</p>

    <p>She too will be so happy if you and your child get on well,
    and it is so very good to be present at times like these. And
    Mother at Leyden will rejoice in it more than anybody else, for
    I believe she has been longing such a long time for life to
    become somewhat happier for Theo. Well, I shall be glad when I
    may congratulate him and you, and I hope that time has already
    arrived.</p>

    <p>In thought always with you and him,</p>

    <p>Your brother, Vincent</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I do not write more as I am not yet quite calm. Goodbye for
    now.</label></p>
