  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Yesterday I was agreeably surprised by a visit from M.
    Salles, who, I think, had had a letter from you. <label content="health.mental">I was quite
    well when he came, so we were able to talk calmly. But I am
    quite upset by the fact that he put himself out for me, the
    more so because I hope that for a time I have recovered my
    clarity of mind.</label></p>

    <p>For the moment it seems to me the best thing will be to stay
    here. I shall see what M. Peyron says when I have the
    opportunity to speak to him; he will probably say that he can
    guarantee absolutely nothing in advance, which seems quite
    right to me.</p>

    <p>Today I sent off some canvases, as follows:</p>

    <p><art id=0641>&ldquo;Ploughed Field&rdquo; with
    background of mountains</art> - it is the same field as <art id=0617>the reapers
    of last summer</art> and can be a pendant to it; I think that one
    will set off the other.</p>

    <p><art id=0662>&ldquo;The Ravine&rdquo;</art> - it is the study done during a
    mistral - I had secured my easel with big stones - <art id=0661>the picture
    of this is not dry; it has a closer drawing and there is more
    controlled passion and more colour in it.</art></p>

    <p>That can go with <art id=0622>another study of mountains, summer effect
    with a road in the foreground and a black cottage</art>.</p>

    <p><art id=0655>&ldquo;The Women Gathering Olives&rdquo;</art> - I had intended
    this picture for Mother and sister, so that they should have
    something a little studied.</p>

    <p>I also have <art id=0656>a copy of it for you</art>, and <art id=0654>the study (more
    coloured, with deeper tones) from nature.</art></p>

    <p><art id=0721>&ldquo;The Fields.&rdquo; Fields of young wheat with
    background of lilac mountains and yellowish sky.</art></p>

    <p><art id=0586>&ldquo;Olive Trees&rdquo; - sunset sky of orange and green</art>
    (<art id=0587>there is also a variant with figures here</art>).</p>

    <p><art id=0707>Ditto. Neutral effect.</art></p>

    <p><art id=0708>Ditto. Neutral effect.</art></p>

    <p><art id=0657>The big plane trees - the chief street or boulevard of St.
    R&eacute;my, study from nature</art> - I have
    <art id=0658>a repetition of it here which is perhaps more finished</art>.</p>

    <p><art id=0648>Copy after Millet: &ldquo;The Diggers.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p><art id=0647>&ldquo;La Veill&eacute;e.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>I must not forget <art id=0650>&ldquo;Rain.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>Please don't look at them without putting them on stretchers
    and framing them in white, that is to say you must take down
    other canvases and mount these on the stretchers one by one -
    if you like - to get an idea of the effect. For the colourings
    absolutely need to be set off by the white frame for you to
    judge the whole. For instance, you can hardly see
    &ldquo;Rain&rdquo; and the grey olive trees without the frame.
    That will somewhat fill the gap left by the canvases gone to
    the Vingtistes - you must ask Tanguy to take down some other
    canvases and mount these on the stretchers so that they can dry
    all the way through.</p>

    <p>In your previous letter you speak of drawings by Hugo - I
    have just seen a volume of the Histoire de France (illustrated)
    by Michelet. I saw admirable drawings by Vierge in it, which
    were just like Victor Hugo's, astonishing things. Do you know
    it? When you see M. Lauzet, ask him if he knows them, they
    remind me of Hervier's talent too, but more complete, with
    figures and more dramatic effects - again they are like
    Menzel's illustrations for the <i>Life of Frederick the
    Great.</i> Very curious. I think that Vierge has also gone
    to Charenton, but how that fellow has worked; at the time Boggs
    had a magnificent wood engraving by him, probably published in
    L'Illustration: &ldquo;Sea Bathing&rdquo; - a crowd of men and
    women - drawn like Dor&eacute;, who once did exactly the
    same subject beautifully in a plate republished in
    L'Illustration - but then in Vierge you get Daumier's rich
    execution <i>full.</i></p>

    <p>I hope you and Jo are well and that you aren't worried on my
    account.</p>

    <p>Write me - if you can - soon, when you have received the
    canvases. A good handshake in thought for you and your
    wife.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
