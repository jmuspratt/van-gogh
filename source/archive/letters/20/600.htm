    <p>Letter 600<br>
     Saint-R&eacute;my, c. 9 July 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Tomorrow I shall send a small roll of canvases by goods
    train. There are four, namely the following:</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li value="1">
        <p><art id=0515>View of Arles - Orchards in bloom</art></p>
      </li>

      <li value="2">
        <p><art id=0609>Ivy</art></p>
      </li>

      <li value="3">
        <p><art id=0579>Lilacs</art></p>
      </li>

      <li value="4">
        <p><art id=0517>Red Chestnuts in the <i>Jardin des Plantes</i> in Arles</art></p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Which will go with the ones you already have, such as the
    <art id=0495>red</art> and<art id=0475> green Vineyard</art>, <art id=0468>the Garden</art>,
    <art id=0412>the Harvest</art>, <art id=0474>the Starry Sky.</art></p>

    <p>I am putting in with them some more studies which are dry,
    but which are more studies from nature than subjects for
    pictures.</p>

    <p>And it is always like that, you must make several before you
    can get a whole that has character. Now for the subjects of
    these seven studies:</p>

    <p><art id=0608>&ldquo;Irises&rdquo;</art>&mdash;&ldquo;View from the Asylum at
    St. R&eacute;my,&rdquo; size 30 canvases. <art id=0514>&ldquo;Peach
    Trees in Bloom&rdquo; (Arles)</art>, &ldquo;Meadows&rdquo; (Arles),
    <art id=0712>&ldquo;Olives&rdquo; (St. R&eacute;my)</art>, <art id=0520>&ldquo;Old
    Willows&rdquo; (Arles)</art>, <art id=0515>&ldquo;Orchard in Bloom.&rdquo;</art></p>

    <p>Now the next package, which will follow in a little while,
    will be made up mostly of the wheat fields and olive
    gardens.</p>

    <p>As you see, I have been to Arles to get these canvases, the
    attendant here accompanied me. We went to M. Salles' house, but
    he had gone on vacation for two months, then to the hospital to
    see M. Rey, whom I did not find either. Then we spent the day
    with my former neighbours, such as my old charwoman and some
    others.</p>

    <p>You get very fond of people who have seen you ill, and it
    has done me a world of good to see again some people who were
    kind and gentle with me then. Someone told me that M. Rey had
    passed an examination and had been to Paris, but the porter at
    the hospital said he did not know anything about it. I am
    curious to know if you have seen him, for he had intended to go
    and see the exhibition and to pay you a visit then. The doctor
    here may not be going to Paris, he suffers a good deal from his
    gout.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">I have received the second package of canvases and paints
    and I thank you very much for them.</label></p>

    <p><art id=0622>The last canvas I have done is a view of mountains with a
    dark hut at the bottom among some olive trees.</art></p>

    <p>I expect you will be greatly absorbed by the thought of the
    child who is to come; I am very glad it is so; I dare think
    that in time you will find a good deal of inner tranquility
    that way.</p>

    <p>The fact that in Paris you take on, as it were, a second
    nature, which over and above the preoccupation of business and
    art makes you less strong than the peasants&mdash;that fact
    does not prevent you from linking yourself through the bonds of
    a wife and child, with this simpler and truer nature, the ideal
    of which keeps haunting us.</p>

    <p>What a business, that S&eacute;cretan sale! I am
    always pleased that the Millets hold their own. But I should
    very much like to see more good reproductions of Millet, so as
    to reach the people.</p>

    <p>His work is sublime, especially considered as a whole, and
    it will become more and more difficult to get an idea of it
    when the pictures are dispersed.</p>

    <p>I am sorry not to be able to put the wheat field with the
    reaper into the package.</p>

    <p>Write me a line soon. A handshake for you and Jo.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
