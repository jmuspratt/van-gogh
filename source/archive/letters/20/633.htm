  <body>
    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your registered letter, containing 150 fr. -
    which arrived this morning. <label content="art.supplies">Also I received canvases and paints
    from Tasset and L'H&ocirc;te (were the ones from Tanguy
    in the same package?) and I cannot be too grateful to you for
    them,</label> for if I had not had my work, I should long ago have been
    even more broken. At present all goes well, the whole horrible
    attack has disappeared like a thunderstorm and I am working to
    give a last stroke of the brush here with a calm and steady
    enthusiasm. I am doing <art id=0681>a canvas of roses with a light green
    back-ground</art> and two canvases representing big
    bunches of violet irises, <art id=0680>one lot against a pink background
    in which the effect is soft and harmonious
    because of the combination of greens, pinks, violets</art>. On the
    other hand, <art id=0678>the other violet bunch (ranging from carmine to
    pure Prussian blue) stands out against a startling citron
    background, with other yellow tones in the
    vase and the stand on which it rests, so it is an effect of
    tremendously disparate complementaries, which strengthen each
    other by their juxtaposition.</art></p>

    <p>These canvases will take a whole month to dry, but the
    attendant here will undertake to send them off after my
    departure.</p>

    <p>I intend to leave this week as soon as possible, and I am
    starting to pack today.</p>

    <p>I'll send you a wire from Tarascon. Yes, I also feel that
    there is a very long stretch of time between the day we said
    goodbye at the station and now.</p>

    <p>But another strange thing, just as we were so struck by
    Seurat's canvases on that day, these last days here are like a
    fresh revelation of colour to me. As for my work, my dear
    brother, I feel more confidence than when I left, and it would
    be ungrateful on my part to curse the Midi, and I confess to
    you that I leave it with great grief.</p>

    <p>If your work should prevent you from coming to meet me at
    the station, or if it should be at an awkward time or the
    weather too bad, don't worry, I'll find my way quite well, and
    I feel so calm that I'd be very much surprised if I lost my
    mental balance. I do so want to see you again and make Jo's and
    the baby's acquaintance. I shall probably arrive in Paris about
    five o'clock in the morning, but anyway the wire will tell you
    exactly when.</p>

    <p>The day of my departure depends on when I'm packed and have
    finished my canvases; I am working on the latter with such
    enthusiasm that packing seems to me more difficult than
    painting. Anyway, it won't be long. I am very glad that this
    has not dragged along, which is always regrettable once you
    have made up your mind. I am looking forward so much to seeing
    the exhibition of Japanese prints again, and I don't at all
    despise seeing the Salon, where I think there must still be
    some interesting things, though having read the account in the
    Figaro, it certainly left me pretty cold.</p>

    <p>Kind regards to Jo, and a good handshake in thought.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
