    <p>Saint-R&eacute;my, c. 2<sup>nd</sup> June 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I must beg you again to send me as soon as possible some
    ordinary brushes about these sizes.</p>

    <p>[<art id=745_V-T_5930>A sketch of the brushes was drawn here.</art>]</p>

    <p>Half a dozen of each, please.</p>

    <p>I hope that you are well and your wife too, and that you are
    enjoying the fine weather a little. Here at any rate we have
    splendid sunshine. <label content="health.general">As for me, my health is good, and as for my
    brain, that will be, let us hope, a matter of time and
    patience.</label></p>

    <p>The director mentioned that he had had a letter from you and
    had written to you; he tells me nothing and I ask him nothing,
    which is the simplest.</p>

    <p>He's a gouty little man - several years a widower, with very
    black spectacles. As the institution is a bit stagnant,
    the man seems to get no great amusement out of his job, and
    besides he has enough to live on. A new man has arrived, who is
    so worked up that he smashes everything and shouts day and
    night, he tears his shirts violently too, and up till now,
    though he is <i>all day long</i> in a bath, he gets hardly any
    quieter, he destroys his bed and everything else in his room,
    upsets his food, etc. It is very sad to see, but they are very
    patient here and will end by seeing him through. New things
    grow old so quickly; I think that if I came to Paris in my
    present state of mind, I would make no difference between a
    so-called dark picture and a light impressionist picture,
    between a varnished picture in oils and a mat picture done with
    solvent.</p>

    <p>I mean by this that by dint of reflection, I have come by
    slow degrees to believe more than ever in the eternal youth of
    the school of Delacroix, Millet, Rousseau, Dupr&eacute;
    and Daubigny, as much as in that of the present, or even in
    that of the artists to come. I hardly think that impressionism
    will ever do more than the romantics for instance. Between that
    and admiring people like Leon Glaize or Perrault there is
    certainly a margin. This morning I saw the country from my
    window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the morning
    star, which looked very big. Daubigny and Rousseau have
    depicted just that, expressing all that it has of intimacy, all
    that vast peace and majesty, but adding as well a feeling so
    individual, so heartbreaking. I have no aversion to that sort
    of emotion.</p>

    <p>I am always filled with remorse, terribly so, when I think
    of my work as being so little in harmony with what I should
    have liked to do. I hope that in the long run this will make me
    do better things, but we have not got to that yet.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I think that you would do well to wash the canvases which
    are quite, quite dry with water <i>and a little spirits of
    wine</i> to take away the oil and the spirit in the impasto.
    The same for <art id=0463>&ldquo;The Night Caf&eacute;&rdquo;</art> and
    <art id=0475>&ldquo;The Green Vineyard&rdquo;</art> and especially <art id=0468>the landscape
    that was in the walnut frame</art>.<art id=00474> &ldquo;Night&rdquo; also, but
    that has been retouched recently and might run with the spirits
    of wine.</art></label></p>

    <p>It's almost a whole month since I came here, not once has
    the least desire to be elsewhere come to me, only the wish to
    work is getting a scrap stronger.</p>

    <p>I do not notice in the others either any very definite
    desire to be anywhere else, and this may well come from the
    feeling that we are too thoroughly shattered for life
    outside.</p>

    <p>What I cannot quite understand is their absolute idleness.
    But that is the great fault of the South and its ruin. But what
    a lovely country, and what lovely blue and what a sun! And yet
    I have only seen the garden and what I can look at through my
    window.</p>

    <p>Have you read the new book by Guy de Maupassant,
    &ldquo;Strong as the Dead,&rdquo; what is the subject of it?
    The last thing I read in that category was Zola's &ldquo;The
    Dream&rdquo;; I thought the figure of the woman, the one who
    did embroidery, very, very beautiful, and the description of
    the embroidery all in gold, just because it is as it were a
    question of the colour of the different yellows, whole and
    broken up. But the figure of the man did not seem very lifelike
    and the great cathedral also gave me the blues. Only that
    contrast of lilac and blue-black did, if you like, make the
    blonde figure stand out. But after all there are things like
    that in Lamartine.</p>

    <p>I hope that you will destroy a lot of the things that are
    too bad in the batch I have sent you, or at least only show
    what is most passable. As for the exhibition of the
    Independents, it's all one to me, just act as if I weren't
    there. So as not to be indifferent, and not to exhibit anything
    too mad, perhaps the &ldquo;Starry Night&rdquo; and the
    landscape with yellow verdure, which was in the walnut frame.
    Since these are two with contrasting colours, it might give
    somebody else the idea of doing those night effects better than
    I have.</p>

    <p>But you must absolutely set your mind at rest about me now.
    When I have received the new canvas and the paints, I am going
    off to see a little of the country.</p>

    <p>Since it is just the season when there are plenty of flowers
    and consequently colour effects, it would perhaps be wise to
    send me five metres more of canvas.</p>

    <p>For the flowers are short-lived and will be replaced by the
    yellow wheat fields. Those especially I hope to catch better
    than I did in Arles. The mistral (since there are some
    mountains) seems much less tiresome than in Arles, where you
    always got it firsthand.</p>

    <p>When you receive the canvases that I have done in the
    garden, you will see that I am not too melancholy here.</p>

    <p>Goodbye for the present, a good handshake in thought for you
    and Jo.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
