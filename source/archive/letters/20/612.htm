  <body>
    <p>Dear Mother,</p>

    <p>Once again I want to write you a letter while you are still
    in the old house, to thank you for your last letter and the
    news of Cor's good voyage. I believe he will work there with
    zest, and thus have some pleasure in his life. What he writes
    you makes me think of what my friend Gauguin told me about
    Panama and Brazil. I did not know until now that
    Isa&auml;cson is also going to the Transvaal. You
    know I never met him personally - but lately I have written him
    because he intended to write about my work in a Dutch paper,
    and I asked him not to do it; but also to thank him for his
    faithful sympathy, as from the beginning we have often thought
    of each other's work and have the same ideas about our old
    Dutch and modern French painters. And I also like De Haan's
    work very much.</p>

    <p>Now I can tell you that what I promised you is quite ready -
    the landscape studies and <art id=0525>a small self-portrait</art>
    and <art id=0483>a study of an interior</art>. But I fear it will disappoint you
    and the whole batch may seem unimportant and ugly to you. Wil
    and you can do what you like with them, and if you feel like
    giving something to the other sisters - for this reason I am
    sending a few more.</p>

    <p>But this does not concern me - I only try to form several
    things into a kind of whole which I would prefer remained
    together, so that it becomes more important in the course of
    time. But I already understand that you will not have room for
    everything, and therefore you may do what you like with them,
    but I advise you to keep them together, at least for some time,
    as in that case you will be better able to judge which ones you
    like best in the long run. I certainly agree with you that it
    is much better for Theo now than before, and I hope everything
    will go well with Jo's confinement; that will set them up for
    quite a while. It is always good to experience the way in which
    a human being comes into the world, and that leads many a
    character to more quietness and truth.</p>

    <p>Nature is very beautiful here in autumn with the yellow
    leaves. I am only sorry that there aren't more vineyards here.
    I started to paint one a few hours away though. It happens that
    a big field becomes quite purple and red, as the Virginia
    creeper with us, and next to that a yellow square, and a little
    farther on a spot which is still green. All this under a sky of
    a beautiful blue, and violet rocks in the distance. <art id=0495>Last year I had a better
    opportunity to paint that than now</art>. I should have liked to add something like it to what
    I am sending you, but I'll owe you this for next year.</p>

    <p>You will see from the self-portrait I add that though I saw
    Paris and other big cities for many years, I keep looking more
    or less like a peasant of Zundert, Toon, for instance, or Piet
    Prins, and sometimes I imagine I also feel and think like them,
    only the peasants are of more use in the world. Only when they
    have all the other things, they get a feeling, a desire for
    pictures, books, etc. In my estimation I consider myself
    certainly below the peasants.</p>

    <p>Well, I am ploughing on my canvases as they do on their
    fields.</p>

    <p>It goes badly enough in our profession - in fact that has
    always been so, but at the moment it is very bad.</p>

    <p>And yet never have such high prices been paid for pictures
    as these days.</p>

    <p>What makes us work on is friendship for each other, and love
    of nature, and finally, if one has taken all the pains to
    master the brush, <i>one cannot leave painting alone.</i>
    Compared with others, I still belong to the lucky ones, but
    think what it must be if one has entered the profession and has
    to leave it before one has done anything, and there are many
    like that. Given ten years as necessary to learn the profession
    and somebody who has struggled through six years and paid for
    them and then has to stop, just think how miserable that is,
    and how many there are like that!</p>

    <p>And those high prices one hears about, paid for work of
    painters who are dead and who were never paid so much while
    they were alive, it is a kind of tulip trade, under which the
    living painters suffer rather than gain any benefit. And it
    will also disappear like the tulip trade.</p>

    <p>But one may reason that, though the tulip trade has long
    been gone and is forgotten, the flower growers have remained
    and will remain. And thus I consider painting too, thinking
    that what abides is like a kind of flower growing. And as far
    as it concerns me, I reckon myself happy to be in it. But for
    the rest!</p>

    <p>This is to show you one must have no illusions. My letter
    has to be posted. At the moment I am working on <art id=0703>a portrait of
    one of the patients here</art>. It is curious that
    after one has been with them for some time and got used to
    them, one does not think of them as being mad any more.</p>

    <p>Embracing you in thought,</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
