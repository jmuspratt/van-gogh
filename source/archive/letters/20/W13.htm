  <body>
    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">Some days ago now I started writing another letter in reply
    to yours, but I discovered that I was not sufficiently master
    of my head to be able to write.</label></p>

    <p>I thank you and Lies for the book by Rod <sup>1</sup>, which
    I have read, and which I shall return to you soon. The
    terrifying title Le sens de la vie scared me a little, but
    seeing that the subject is fortunately hardly discussed in the
    book, I much enjoyed reading something which bears a family
    resemblance to Le philosophe sous les toits by Souvestre, or to
    Monsieur, Madame et b&eacute;b&eacute; by Diuz. The
    moral of the story is that under certain circumstances a
    gentleman prefers ultimately to live with a sweet and very
    devoted wife and his child, rather than to live in the
    restaurants and caf&eacute;s of the boulevards, a life he
    had led before without committing too many excesses. This is
    undoubtedly very nice.</p>

    <p>It is remarkable that the good Madame Duquesne's illness
    came to an unexpected end after all. Nevertheless it must have
    been a day of blessed deliverance for her.</p>

    <p>If you say in your letter that, as you observe so many other
    people who try to make their way in life, they seem to be
    making more progress - coming and going - than you - oh well,
    what shall I say to that? I myself occasionally have a feeling
    of stupefaction when I look at my own life, and for that matter
    at the lives of so many other workers in my profession.</p>

    <p>Today I sent Theo a dozen drawings after canvases I am
    working on; otherwise my life is definitely as inept as it was
    when I was a twelve-year-old boy at boarding school, where I
    learned absolutely nothing.</p>

    <p>An enormous number of painters who would decidedly not be
    able to do my twelve canvases, either in two months or in
    twelve, are now living in town or in the country and are looked
    up to as artists as well as intelligent people. But believe me,
    I say this in order to explain my meaning, and not because I
    want to give expression to the urgency, or possibility, or
    desire on my part to change things. We hardly know life, we
    know so little of its foundation, and besides, we are living in
    a period in which everybody seems to be talking raving
    nonsense, and everything seems to be in a tottering state, so
    that it cannot be called being unhappy if we have found a duty
    that forces us to remain quietly in our corner, busy with our
    modest work, which is simpler than that imposed by certain
    other duties whose existence also makes sense. In the days we
    are living through, one runs the risk of returning from a
    battle ashamed of having fought a battle.</p>

    <p>So my friend who was with me at Arles and some others have
    organized an exhibition, <sup>1</sup> which I should have
    participated in if I had been in good health. And what have
    they been able to do? - next to nothing - and yet there was
    something new in their canvases, something good, which gave
    <i>me</i> pleasure, for instance, and aroused <i>my</i>
    enthusiasm - this I assure you. Among artists, we no longer
    know what to say to each other, we don't know whether we ought
    to laugh or to weep at it, and the damnable fact is that we are
    doing neither one nor the other; we are happiest after all when
    we possess a small quantity of paint and canvas - which we lack
    at times too - and can at least work.</p>

    <p>But all thoughts of a regular life, all thoughts of being
    able to evoke in ourselves or in others gentle ideas or
    sensations - all this must of necessity appear purely utopian
    to us.</p>

    <p>And though only yesterday they paid over half a million
    francs for Millet's &ldquo;Angelus,&rdquo; don't think that
    more souls will now feel what Millet had in mind, or that
    middle-class people or workingmen are now going to hang
    lithographs of this &ldquo;Angelus&rdquo; of Millet's in their
    houses, for instance. Don't think that for such a reason those
    painters who are still at work among the peasants in Brittany
    should become more encouraged or suffer less under the black
    need that always tortured Millet, need of courage above all.
    Alas, we often get out of breath and faith, which is certainly
    the wrong thing to do - but there, now we return to our
    starting point: if we nevertheless want to go on working, we
    have to resign ourselves to the obstinate callousness of the
    times and to our isolation, which is sometimes as hard to
    endure as living in exile. And so we have to expect, after the
    years that, relatively speaking, we lost, poverty, sickness,
    old age, madness and always exile. Yes, certainly, this is the
    moment to say, &ldquo;Blessed be Thebe, daughter of Telhui,
    priestess of Osiris, who never complained of anyone.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Wouldn't cherishing the memory of good people be of greater
    value on the whole than being among the ambitious? I am now
    rather absorbed in reading Shakespeare, whose words Theo sent
    me here, where I am at last quiet enough to be able to engage
    in a little more difficult reading.</p>

    <p>I have started with the historical plays, and have already
    read Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, and part of Henry VI - for
    these dramas were the least known to me. <sup>2</sup> Did you
    ever read King Lear? But never mind, I think I am not going to
    urge you too much to read books or dramas, seeing that I
    myself, after reading them for some time, feel obliged to go
    out and look at a blade of grass, the branch of a fir tree, an
    ear of wheat, in order to calm down. So if you want to do, as
    the artists do, go look at the red and white poppies with their
    bluish leaves, their buds soaring on gracefully bent stems. The
    hours of trouble and strife will know how to find us without
    our going to look for them.</p>

    <p>The separation from Cor will be hard; it is drawing nearer
    and nearer. What else can one do, when we think of all the
    things we do not know the reason for, than go look at a field
    of wheat? The history of those plants is like our own; for
    aren't we, who live on bread, to a considerable extent like
    wheat, at least aren't we forced to submit to growing like a
    plant without the power to move, by which I mean in what way
    our imagination impels us, and to being reaped when we are
    ripe, like the same wheat?</p>

    <p>What I want to tell you is that the wisest thing to do is
    not to long for complete recovery, not to long to get back more
    strength than I have now, and I shall probably get used to the
    idea that I shall be broken a little sooner or a little later -
    what does it matter after all?</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">What you write about Theo's health is something I know quite
    well. Nevertheless I hope that this domestic life will fully
    restore his health.</label> I think his wife sensible and affectionate
    enough to take very good care of him, and to see to it that he
    does not eat that restaurant stuff exclusively, but that he
    once more comes to know the true Dutch cooking. That Dutch
    cooking is very good, so let her more or less change into a
    cook and let her assume a reassuring attitude, even if she
    should have to be a bit tart about it. Theo himself is obliged
    to be a Parisian, but notwithstanding that he is absolutely in
    need of being reminded of his youth and his past. I, who have
    neither wife nor child, feel the need of seeing the wheat
    fields, and it would be difficult for me to stay in a city for
    any length of time. Besides, knowing his character, I fully
    expect that his marriage will do him an enormous amount of
    good. Before one can arrive at an opinion about his health, it
    is more or less necessary to give them time to take root
    together and attain harmony.</p>

    <p>And besides, I dare say she will have found the means to
    make life a bit more pleasant for him than it has been up to
    now. For he has been through hard times.</p>

    <p>That is all for now, for I have to finish this letter if I
    want it to go off today, and I haven't got time to read it
    over. So in case I have made many blunders, you will kindly
    excuse me. Be prosperous, and don't worry too much; and by
    cultivating your garden, and by doing all the other things, be
    well assured that you are making headway against trouble. A
    kiss in thought.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>
