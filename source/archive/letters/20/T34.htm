    <p>Letter T34<br>
     Paris, 10 May 1890</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your two letters; I am happy to see that you
    continue to feel better, and it would give me a great deal of
    pleasure if you could undertake the journey without danger.
    Does it seem to you too that it is such a long time since we
    have seen each other? If you think it so annoying to travel in
    the company of one of the people of the establishment, my God,
    you must take the risk, although I must say that I am not like
    you, and that if I were you I should do it to avoid all the
    misery that would be brought about by the recurrence of a
    crisis, for instance if at some unknown railway station you
    should fall into the hands of people you don't know, and of
    whom you cannot tell how they would treat you. Now as soon as
    you start be sure to send me a telegram at once to let me know
    what time you will arrive at the Gare de Lyon, so that I may be
    able to go meet you. Of course it is understood that you will
    stay with us, if you will content yourself with the little room
    where we have lodged Wil and many others.</p>

    <p>I wrote to Dr. Gachet yesterday to ask him when he is coming
    to Paris, for then he will sit for consultations, and I asked
    him at the same time to look for a boardinghouse for you. A
    change of country might certainly do you good, but with a view
    to wintertime it might be better if you were in a warmer
    climate. But we shall have time enough to talk about it. I also
    wrote to Dr. Peyron to tell him that, unless there should be
    some definite danger, I should like him to let you do as you
    wish, and to let you go. As he has been good to you, try not to
    hurt him.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">I have ordered the paints you asked for from Tanguy and
    Tasset, as I told myself that they would never be lost. If the
    paints have not arrived yet, please leave orders for them to be
    returned.</label> Would it be possible for you to find a quiet spot
    where you will not be surrounded by people or things that annoy
    you? I hope so from the bottom of my heart, and at any rate it
    would mean an improvement, but people are much the same
    everywhere, and when you are engrossed in artistic things, you
    will find precious few people who understand you. To them it is
    Latin, and they see only a pastime in it, which one should not
    take seriously.</p>

    <p>I have not yet been to the Salon, which they say is pretty
    mediocre, but there is an exhibition of Japanese drawings and
    cr&eacute;pe prints - you will see it when you are here -
    which is superb. I wish you were here already.</p>

    <p>Don't forget to wire. Cordial greetings from Jo and the
    little one; they are both well; a cordial handshake, and I hope
    to see you soon.</p>

    <p>Theo</p>

    <p>I am sending you herewith 150 francs for the journey; and if
    there should not be enough money, please send me a telegram.
