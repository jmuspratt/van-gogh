  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Until now I have not been able to write you, but being a bit
    better just now, I did not wish to delay wishing you a happy
    year, since it's your birthday, you and your wife and child. At
    the same time I beg you to accept the various pictures I am
    sending you with my thanks for all the kindness you have shown
    me, for without you I should be very unhappy.</p>

    <p>You will see that first of all there are canvases after
    Millet.</p>

    <p>Not being intended for the public, perhaps you will
    eventually make presents of these to our sisters. But first you
    must keep what you like and as much as you want, it's
    yours absolutely. One of these days you will send me something
    else to do by past or present artists, if you can find
    anything.</p>

    <p>The rest of the canvases aren't much; not having been able
    to work for two months, I am very much behind. You will find
    that<art id=0707> the olives with the pink sky</art> are the best, and the
    mountains, I imagine; the first would go well as a pendant to
    <art id=0710>those with the yellow sky</art>. As for <art id=0540>the portrait of the
    Arl&eacute;sienne</art>, you know that I have promised <art id=0542>a copy
    of it to our friend Gauguin</art>, and you must send it to him. Then
    <art id=0620>the cypresses are for M. Aurier</art>. I should have liked to do them
    again with a little less impasto, but I haven't time.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">They must get several washes with cold water, then a strong
    varnish when the impastos are thoroughly dry, then the blacks
    will not become dirty-looking when the oil has evaporated.</label> In
    the meantime I shall of course want paints, which you might get
    again in part from Tanguy, if he is hard up, or if he should
    like it. But of course he mustn't be more expensive than the
    other one. <label content="art.supplies">Here is the list of the colours I want:</p>

    <p>Then (but at Tasset's) 2 geranium lake, medium-sized tubes.
    You would do me a kindness if you sent me at least half of them
    at once, at once, because I have wasted too much time.</p>

    <p>Then I shall need 6 brushes - 6 marten brushes - and 7
    meters of canvas or even 10.</label></p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">What am I to say about these last two months?
    Things didn't go well at all. I am sadder and more wretched than I can say,
    and I do not know at all where I have got to.</label></p>

    <p>The order for paints is rather big, so let me wait for half
    of it if it is more convenient to you.</p>

    <p>While I was ill I nevertheless did <art id=674>some little canvases from
    memory</art> which you will see later, <art id=0675>memories of the North</art>, and
    now I have just finished <art id=0676>a corner of a sunny meadow</art>, which I think
    is fairly vigorous. You will see it soon.</p>

    <p>M. Peyron being away, I have not yet read my letters, but I
    know that some have come. He has been good enough to keep you
    posted on the situation, I do not know myself what to do or
    what to think, but I greatly wish to leave this house. That
    will not surprise you, I need say no more to you.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">Letters from home have come too, which I have
    not yet had the courage to read, I feel so melancholy. Please ask M. Aurier
    not to write any more articles on my painting, insist upon
    this, that to begin with he is mistaken about me, since I am
    too overwhelmed with grief to be able to face publicity. Making
    pictures distracts me, but if I hear them spoken of, it pains
    me more than he knows.</label> How is Bernard? As there are some
    canvases in duplicate, if you like you can exchange with him,
    for a good canvas by him would be a fine thing to have in your
    collection.</p>

    <p>I felt ill at the time I was doing the almond blossoms. If I
    had been able to go on working, you can judge from it that I
    would have done others of trees in blossom. Now the trees in
    blossom are almost over, really I have no luck. Yes, I must try
    to get out of here, but where to go? I do not think I could be
    more shut up and more of a prisoner in the homes where they do
    not pretend to leave you free, such as at Charenton or
    Montevergues.</p>

    <p>If you write home, give them my kindest regards and tell
    them I often think of them. There, a good handshake for you and
    Jo, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Please send me what you can find of figure among my old
    drawings. I am thinking of doing the picture of the
    <art id=0082>&ldquo;Peasants at Dinner&rdquo; [The Potato Eaters], with the lamplight
    effect again</art>. That canvas must be quite black now, perhaps I could do it again altogether from
    memory.</p>

    <p>You must send me the &ldquo;Women Gleaning&rdquo; and the
    &ldquo;Diggers&rdquo; if they are still there.</p>

    <p>Then, if you like, I will do <art id=0084>the old tower of Nuenen</art> again
    and <art id=0083>the cottage</art>. I think that if you still have them, I can
    make something better of them now from memory.</p>
