  <body>
    <p>My dear brother,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your kind letter and the portrait of Jo, which
    is very pretty and a very successful pose. Now look, I'm going
    to be very straightforward in my reply and as practical as
    possible. First, I categorically reject what you say, that I
    must be accompanied the whole way. Once on the train, I will be
    quite safe, I am not one of those who are dangerous - <label content="health.mental">and even
    supposing I do have an attack, there are other passengers in
    the carriage, aren't there, and anyway, don't they know at
    every station what to do in such cases? You have so many qualms
    about this that they weigh me down heavily enough to discourage
    me completely.</p>

    <p>I have just said the same thing to M. Peyron, and I pointed
    out to him that attacks like the one I have just had have
    invariably been followed by three or four months of complete
    calm.</label> I want to take advantage of this period to move - I must
    move in any case, my intention to leave is now unshakeable.</p>

    <p>I do not feel competent to judge the way disorders are
    treated here. I don't feel like going into details - but please
    remember that I warned you about 6 months ago that if I had
    another attack of the same kind I should wish to change
    asylums. And I have already delayed too long, having allowed an
    attack to go by in the meantime. I was in the middle of my work
    then and I wanted to finish the canvas I had started. But for
    that I should no longer be here. Right, so now I'm saying that
    it seems to me that a fortnight at most (although I'd be
    happier with a week) should be enough to prepare the move. I
    shall have myself accompanied as far as Tarascon - even one or
    two stations further on, if you insist. When I arrive in Paris
    (I'll send a telegram on leaving here) you could come and pick
    me up at the Gare de Lyon.</p>

    <p>Now I should think it would be as well to go and see this
    doctor in the country as soon as possible, and we could leave
    the luggage at the station. So I should not be staying with you
    for more than, let's say, 2 or 3 days. I would then leave for
    this village, where I could stay at the inn to begin with.</p>

    <p>What I think you might do one of these days - without delay
    - is to write to our future friend, the doctor in question,
    &ldquo;My brother greatly desires to make your acquaintance,
    and preferring to consult you before prolonging his stay in
    Paris, hopes that you will approve of his coming and spending a
    few weeks in your village in order to do some studies; he has
    every confidence in reaching an understanding with you,
    believing that his illness will abate with a return to the
    north, whereas his condition would threaten to become more
    acute if he stayed any longer in the south.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>There, you write him something like that, we can send him a
    telegram the day after I arrive in Paris, or the day after
    that, and he would probably meet me at the station.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">The surroundings here are beginning to weigh me down more
    than I can say - heavens above, I've been patient for more than
    a year - I need some air, I feel overwhelmed by boredom and
    grief.</label></p>

    <p>Also the work is pressing, and I should be wasting my time
    here. Why then, I ask you, are you so afraid of accidents?
    That's not what should be frightening you. Heavens above, every
    day since I've been here I've watched people falling down, or
    going out of their minds - what is more important is to try and
    take misfortune into account.</p>

    <p>I assure you that it's quite something to resign oneself to
    living under surveillance, even if it is sympathetic, and to
    sacrifice one's liberty, to remain outside society with nothing
    but one's work as distraction.</p>

    <p>This has given me wrinkles which will not be smoothed out in
    a hurry. Now that things are beginning to weigh me down too
    <i>heavily</i> here, I think it only fair that they should be
    brought to an end.</p>

    <p>So please ask M. Peyron to allow me to leave, let's say by
    the 15th at the latest. If I wait, I shall be letting the
    favourable period of calm between two attacks go by, and by
    leaving now, I should have the time I need to make the
    acquaintance of the other doctor. Then if the illness does come
    back in a little while, it would not be unexpected, and
    depending upon how serious it is, we could see if I can
    continue to be at liberty, or if I must settle down in a
    lunatic asylum for good. In the latter case - as I told you in
    my last letter, I would go into a home where the patients work
    in the fields &amp; the workshop. I'm sure I'd find even more
    subjects to paint there than here.</p>

    <p>So remember that the journey costs a lot, that it is
    pointless [to provide an escort], and that I have every right
    to change homes if I wish. I am not demanding my complete
    liberty.</p>

    <p>I have tried to be patient up till now, I haven't done
    anybody any harm, is it fair to have me accompanied like some
    dangerous animal? No, thank you, I protest. If I should have an
    attack, they know what to do at every station, and I should let
    them get on with it.</p>

    <p>But I'm sure that my nerve will not desert me. I am so
    distressed at leaving like this that the distress will be
    stronger than the madness. So I'm sure I shall have what nerve
    it takes.</p>

    <p>M. Peyron won't commit himself, because he doesn't want to
    take the responsibility, he says, but that way we'll never,
    ever, get to the end of it, the thing will drag on and on, and
    we'll end up by getting angry with each other. As for me, my
    dear brother, my patience is at an end, quite at an end, I
    cannot go on, I must make a change, even if it's only a
    stopgap.</p>

    <p>However, there really is a chance that the change will do me
    good - the work is going well, I've done <art id=0676>2 canvases of the
    newly cut grass in the grounds</art>, <art id=0672>one of which is extremely
    simple</art>.</p>

    <p>[Here was drawn <art id=825_V-T_6310>a sketch of "Tree trunks."</art>]</p>

    <p>Here is a hasty sketch of it - a pine trunk, pink and
    purple, and then the grass with some white flowers and
    dandelions, a little rose bush and some other tree trunks in
    the background right at the top of the canvas. I shall be out
    of doors over there. I'm sure that my zest for work will get
    the better of me and make me indifferent to every thing else,
    as well as put me in a good humour. And I shall let myself go
    there, not without thought, but without brooding over what
    might have been.</p>

    <p>They say that in painting one should look for nothing more
    and hope for nothing more than a good picture and a good talk
    and a good dinner as the height of happiness, and ignore the
    less brilliant digressions. That may well be true, so why
    shouldn't one seize the hour, particularly if in so doing one
    steals a march on one's illness?</p>

    <p>A good handshake for you and Jo. I think I shall do a
    painting for myself after the portrait, it may not be a
    resemblance, but anyway I'll try.</p>

    <p>See you soon, I hope - and come on now, spare me this
    imposed travel companion.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
