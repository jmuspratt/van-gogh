  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter. You are absolutely right when you
    say that M. Salles has been splendid in all of this, I am under
    the greatest obligation to him.</p>

    <p>I want to tell you that I think I have done well to come
    here, because, by seeing the <i>reality</i> of the assorted
    madmen and lunatics in this menagerie, I am losing my vague
    dread, my fear of the thing. And bit by bit I am getting to
    consider that madness is just a disease like any other. Thus
    the change in surroundings will do me good, I think.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">As far as I can tell, the doctor here is of the opinion that
    what I have had is some sort of epileptic attack. But I haven't
    asked him more about it.</label></p>

    <p>Have you received the case of paintings, I am curious to
    know if they have suffered, yes or no?</p>

    <p>I have two more on the go - <art id=0608>violet irises</art> and <art id=0579>a lilac bush</art>,
    two subjects taken from the garden.</p>

    <p>The idea of my duty to get back to work occurs to me a lot
    and I believe that all my faculties for work will soon come
    back to me. It's just that the work often absorbs me so much
    that I think that for the rest of my life I will always be a
    bit absent-minded and awkward when shifting for myself.</p>

    <p>I won't write you a long letter - I want to try to reply to
    my new sister's letter, which moved me very much, but I don't
    know if I'll be able to do it.</p>

    <p>A handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter in which I especially looked for
    news of my brother. And I find it excellent. I see you have
    already noticed that he likes Paris, and this more or less
    surprises you, since you do not like it at all, or rather like
    mostly the flowers there, such as the wisterias, I suppose,
    which are probably coming into bloom.</p>

    <p>Might it not be a fact that when you are fond of something,
    you see it better and more truly than when you are not fond of
    it? For him and me Paris is certainly already something like a
    graveyard where many artists have perished whom we once knew
    directly or indirectly.</p>

    <p>Certainly Millet, whom you will learn to like very much, and
    many others with him, tried to get out of Paris. But as for
    Eugene Delacroix, for instance, it is difficult to imagine him,
    as a man, otherwise than as a Parisian.</p>

    <p>All this is to urge you - with all caution it is true - to
    believe in the <i>possibility</i> that there are <i>homes</i>
    in Paris and not just apartments.</p>

    <p>Anyway - fortunately you are yourself his home.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">It is rather queer perhaps that the result of this terrible
    attack is that there is hardly any very definite desire or hope
    left in my mind, and I wonder if this is the way one thinks
    when, with the passions lessened, one descends the hill instead
    of climbing it.</label> And anyhow, my sister, if you can believe, or
    almost believe, that everything is always for the best in the
    best of worlds, then perhaps you will also be able to believe
    that Paris is the best of the cities in it.</p>

    <p>Have you noticed that the old cab horses there have large
    beautiful eyes, as heartbroken as Christians sometimes have?
    However it may be, we are neither savages nor peasants, and it
    is perhaps even a <i>duty</i> to like civilization (so called).
    After all it would probably be hypocrisy to say or think that
    Paris is bad when one is living there. Besides, the first time
    one sees Paris, it may be that everything in it seems
    unnatural, foul and sad.</p>

    <p>Anyway, if you do not like Paris, above all do not like
    painting nor those who are directly or indirectly concerned in
    it, for it is only too doubtful whether it is beautiful or
    useful.</p>

    <p>But what is to be done? - there are people who love nature
    even though they are cracked or ill, those are the painters;
    then there are those who like what is made by men's hands, and
    these even go so far as to like pictures.</p>

    <p>Though here there are some patients very seriously ill, the
    fear and horror of madness that I used to have has already
    lessened a great deal. And though here you continually hear
    terrible cries and howls like beasts in a menagerie, in spite
    of that people get to know each other very well and help each
    other when their attacks come on. When I am working in the
    garden, they all come to look, and assure you they have the
    discretion and manners to leave me alone - more than the good
    people of the town of Arles, for instance.</p>

    <p>It may well be that I shall stay here long enough - I have
    never been so peaceful as here and in the hospital in Arles -
    to be able to paint a little at last. Quite near here there are
    some little mountains, grey and blue, and at their foot some
    very, very green cornfields and pines.</p>

    <p>I shall count myself very happy if I can manage to work
    enough to earn my living, for it worries me a lot when I think
    that I have done so many pictures and drawings without ever
    selling one. Do not be in too much of a hurry to think that
    this is an injustice. I myself don't know in the least.</p>

    <p>Thanking you again for having written to me. I am so very
    glad to think that now my brother is not going home to an empty
    apartment when he goes back in the evening.</p>

    <p>I shake your hand in thought, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your brother, Vincent</p>
