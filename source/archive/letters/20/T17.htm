    <p>Letter T17<br>
     Paris, 18 September 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I have put off replying to your last letter, as I had hoped
    to meet Father Pissarro. He has gone back home now, but intends
    to return to Paris shortly. When Father Tangui and I had a
    talk, we already touched upon the question of whether there
    might be a means of bringing about the arrangement you speak
    of, but then there came the death of his mother, so that it was
    not the right moment. Last year De Haan wanted to go and stay
    with him, but then he said that he didn't have enough room, and
    he went to look for accommodation at the houses of his
    neighbours, but in vain. I spoke about it with Jouve, who
    promised me to be on the lookout for an arrangement, for
    staying with him is impossible through lack of room. But he has
    got his studio. He gives the impression of being better off now
    that he has found work as a decorator. He is a man with a lot
    of common sense. But as regards what is essential - to know
    whether your health is going to improve, whether you are going
    to live with one or the other of these people, that is the
    great question. When you speak of conquering your disease by
    work, my dear old fellow, you never did anything else, and for
    this reason you need not change your way of life. On the
    contrary, I think that the only thing which can cure you is for
    you to try to fortify your body, and those dark thoughts will
    vanish as soon as you have some more blood in your body. I am
    always afraid when you are working that way, in a frenzy - for
    you necessarily exhaust yourself by it. I understand that
    idleness is a weight on your mind, especially if you have no
    company to your liking; but when you come here, there is the
    danger of finding company that will enervate you. I should say
    go into the country somewhere where there is some forgotten
    artist, but you know how much you suffer from cold, as long as
    you are not absolutely well, you ought not to be alone.
    According to Rivet, and also according to what I conclude from
    Mr. Peyron's letters, there is a possibility, which you would
    rather not believe, but it is absolutely necessary that you do
    nothing imprudent, and that you stay under the supervision of a
    doctor. Do you want to go to a sanatorium here until the winter
    is over, and then go into the country to paint? <i>Please give
    a categorical answer to this.</i> Why do you stay locked up,
    and why don't you go out into the fresh air? This can only do
    you good, whereas a sedentary life won't do at all for you.</p>

    <p>It is also necessary for you to eat meat.</p>

    <p><label content="art.supplies">You will probably have received the paints from Tasset's; as
    for the second consignment of white, it will reach you within a
    very short time, for he didn't have any of it in stock.</label> There
    are three pictures by Meunier at the exhibition which you would
    have seen with pleasure. One of them is a study of red roofs
    above which rise the chimney stacks of factories, all of which
    have heavy streaks of smoke standing out against a milky
    morning sky. Number 2 is a group of workmen on their way to the
    factory, marching two abreast through heaps of slag and coal,
    wooden props, black chunks threatening the sky. Number 3,
    &ldquo;La Hercheuse.&rdquo; She stands talking to a young boy
    before going down into the mine. They are dressed in the same
    way, but she is all woman; above their heads a big beam cuts
    off part of the sky against which they are delineated. And this
    too, though, it may be neither impressionistic nor modern
    painting, is very good for all that; all three pictures are
    hoisted high up in the room.</p>

    <p>There is also a life-size puddler in bronze, which looks
    like some figure by Millet, also very good.</p>

    <p>Jo is quite well; she is now somewhere in the middle of her
    pregnancy. So far all goes well; she is big, which hinders her
    a little, but apart from a fit of nausea now and then, there is
    nothing the matter with her. She is no longer uneasy now, and
    has no fears. I hope you are getting better, and that you are
    not feeling too unhappy. We often speak and think of you.</p>

    <p>Kindest regards from Jo and a cordial handshake.</p>

    <p>Yours, Theo</p>
