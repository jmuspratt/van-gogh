    <p>Dear Mother,</p>

    <p>I intended to answer your letter many days ago, but I could
    not bring myself to write, as I sat painting from morning to
    evening, and thus the time passed. I imagine that, like me,
    your thoughts are much with Jo and Theo: how glad I was when
    the news came that it had ended well: it was a good thing that
    Wil stayed on. I should have greatly preferred him to call the
    boy after Father, of whom I have been thinking so much these
    days, instead of after me; but seeing it has now been done, I
    started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their
    bedroom, <art id=0671>big branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky</art>.</p>

    <p>I thank you very much for the news about Cor, don't forget
    to give him my regards when you write him. I suppose you will
    be back in Leyden by now. These last days we have had rather
    bad weather here, but today it was a real spring day, and the
    fields of young wheat, with the violet hills in the distance,
    are so beautiful, and the almond trees are beginning to blossom
    everywhere.</p>

    <p>I was rather surprised at the article they wrote about me.
    Isa&auml;cson wanted to do one some time ago, and I
    asked him not to; I was sorry when I read it, because it is so
    exaggerated; the problem is different - what sustains me in my
    work is the very feeling that there are several others doing
    the same thing I am, so why an article on me and not on those
    six or seven others, etc.?</p>

    <p>But I must admit that afterward, when my surprise had passed
    off a little, I felt at times very much cheered by it;
    <label content="business.sales">moreover, yesterday Theo wrote me that they had sold one of my
    pictures at Brussels for 400 francs. <sup>1</sup> </label>Compared with
    other prices, also those in Holland, this is little, but
    therefore I try to be productive to be able to go on working at
    a reasonable cost. And if we have to try to earn our bread with
    our hands, I have to make up for pretty considerable expenses.
    The letter from you and Wil has just arrived, many thanks for
    it; I'd have written you before, but as I said, my head felt so
    little like writing because of rather hard work.</p>

    <p>Now I am strongly inclined to take advantage of my good luck
    in selling this picture by going to Paris to visit Theo. And
    thanks to the physician here, I shall leave feeling calmer and
    healthier than when I came. Trying how it goes outside a
    hospital is perhaps only natural.</p>

    <p>Though work may perhaps be more difficult when I am free
    again.</p>

    <p>Well, let's hope for the best. It is curious that my friend
    with whom I worked for some time in Arles should want to go to
    Antwerp, and that way I should be a little nearer to all of
    you. But I am afraid this is not quite practicable, also
    because I think it would be more expensive, and when one is
    used to the climate here, perhaps one's health might not be
    able to stand being back in the North. But I will begin by
    trying it a few weeks in Paris.</p>

    <p>An embrace in thought.</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
