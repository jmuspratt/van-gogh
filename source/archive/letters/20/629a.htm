  <body>
    <p>Dear Mother and sister,</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">After having been unwell for two months, it is only now that
    I am able to write you a letter.</label></p>

    <p>Until today I have not been able either to bring myself to
    read your letter or to write one, and the doctor not being at
    home today, I cannot get the letters and the package you sent
    me, but in the meantime I don't want to postpone thanking you
    both most heartily. With all my heart I hope that all is well
    with you both, and also with Anna and Lies and their
    families</p>

    <p>Today I wrote Theo and sent him a number of pictures, some
    of which I expect him to send on to you. So you see I have not
    been able to work during the most favorable part of spring,
    consequently things aren't going too well. But what can a man
    do about it? Every change is not a change for the better, but I
    am longing to get away from here; what one has to endure here
    is hardly bearable.</p>

    <p>These last few days I have been working on the picture of a
    lawn in the blazing sun with yellow dandelions.<label content="health.mental"> I continued
    painting even when my illness was at its height,</label> among other
    things a memory of Brabant,<art id=0673> hovels with moss-covered roofs and
    beech hedges on an autumn evening with a stormy sky, the sun
    setting amid ruddy clouds</art>. Also <art id=0695>a turnip field
    with women gathering green stuff in the snow</art>.</p>

    <p>I have asked Theo to let me have as many of my old drawings
    as he has kept.</p>

    <p>Do you happen to have any of my old studies and drawings at
    home? Though they may not be good in themselves, they may serve
    to refresh my memory, and so be the subjects for new work, but
    I do not want those you have hanging on the walls, for
    instance. I should prefer quick sketches of peasant figures.
    But it is not important enough for you to rummage a long time
    to find them.</p>

    <p>With all my heart I hope you are both well; and before long
    I shall write more. Believe me, I often think of you. I embrace
    you in thought.</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>

    <p>As soon as I heard that my work was having some success, and
    read the article in question, I feared at once that I should be
    punished for it; this is how things nearly always go in a
    painter's life: success is about the worst thing that can
    happen.</p>
