    <p>Letter 608<br>
     Saint-R&eacute;my, 28 September 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am writing you another letter to explain that there are
    three studies missing in the package of canvases you already
    have, because the postage for the roll with these taken out was
    3.50 fr. less. So I will send them at the next
    opportunity&mdash;or rather they are leaving today with other
    canvases&mdash;as follows:</p>

    <table width="51.77%" border="1" cols="2" rows="4">
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="White" width="57.45%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p><art id=0718>Wheat Fields</art></p>
        </td>

        <td bgcolor="White" width="42.55%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p><art id=0613>Study of Cypresses</art></p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="White" width="57.45%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p><art id=0615>Wheat Field and Cypresses</art></p>
        </td>

        <td bgcolor="White" width="42.55%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p><art id=0617>Reaper</art></p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="White" width="57.45%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p><art id=0717>ditto</art></p>
        </td>

        <td bgcolor="White" width="42.55%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p><art id=0618>ditto</art></p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="White" width="57.45%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p><art id=0746>Ivy</art></p>
        </td>

        <td bgcolor="White" width="42.55%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p><art id=0711>Olives</art></p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>then also the three above-mentioned - <art id=0581>Poppies</art> - <art id=0612>Night
    Effect</art> - <art id=0735>Moonrise</art>.</p>

    <p>Soon I shall send you some small canvases with the four or
    five studies that I want to give Mother and our sister. These
    studies are drying now, they are size 10 and 12 canvases, small
    copies of the <art id=0743>&ldquo;Wheat Field&rdquo;</art> and <art id=0621>the
    &ldquo;Cypresses,&rdquo;</art> &ldquo;Olives,&rdquo; the
    &ldquo;Reaper,&rdquo; and <art id=0483>the &ldquo;Bedroom&rdquo;</art> and <art id=0525>a little
    self-portrait</art>.</p>

    <p>That will give them a good start and I think that it will
    give you, as well as me, some pleasure to arrange for our
    sister to have a little collection of pictures. I am doing
    copies on a reduced scale of the best canvases for them, and I
    would also like them to have the red and <art id=0475>green
    &ldquo;Vineyards,&rdquo;</art> <art id=0517>the pink &ldquo;Chestnut Trees,&rdquo;</art> and
    <art id=0474>the &ldquo;Night Effect&rdquo; you exhibited</art>.</p>

    <p>You will see that I am gaining a little in patience and that
    perseverance will be one result of my illness. I feel freer
    from many preoccupations. Someday you must send me - when it is
    convenient - <art id=0495>the red &ldquo;Vineyard&rdquo;</art> and other canvases
    for this purpose, after you have seen the five I have done.</p>

    <p>Now as for the &ldquo;Reaper&rdquo; - first I thought that
    the large-sized duplicate that I am sending you was not bad -
    but afterward, when the days of mistral and rain came, I
    preferred the canvas done from nature, which seemed rather
    strange to me. But no, when the weather is cold and sad, it is
    precisely that which makes me recall that furnace of summer
    over the white-hot wheat, so it is not so exaggerated after
    all.</p>

    <p>Old Peyron has come back and talked to me about having seen
    you and said that doubtless your letter would give me all the
    details of the conversation which he had with you. And that in
    any case the result was that it would be wise to stay on here
    for a while. Which, being my own opinion too, goes without
    saying.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, if an attack returns, I persist in wishing to
    try a change of climate and returning to the North, even as a
    last resort.</p>

    <p>M. Peyron said that you looked well, which pleased me.<label content="art.supplies"> I

    <p>For there are lovely autumn effects to do.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I feel quite normal now, and do not remember the bad days at
    all.</p>

    <p>With the work and very regular food, this will probably last
    a pretty long time, notwithstanding the ups and downs, and
    anyhow I shall go on working like this unless the thing
    appears.</label> For at the end of the month you will receive another
    dozen studies.</p>

    <p>Am I mistaken, your letter seems to me to be very late this
    time?</p>

    <p>Unfortunately there are no vineyards here; but for that I
    should have done nothing else this autumn. There are plenty but
    it would be necessary to go and stay in another village to do
    them.</p>

    <p>On the other hand the olive trees are very characteristic,
    and I am struggling to catch them. They are old silver,
    sometimes with more blue in them, sometimes greenish, bronzed,
    fading white above a soil which is yellow, pink, violet-tinted
    or orange, to dull red ochre. Very difficult though, very
    difficult. But that suits me and induces me to work wholly in
    gold or silver. And perhaps one day I shall do a personal
    impression of them like what the sunflowers were for the
    yellows. If I had had some of them last autumn! But this half
    liberty often prevents me from doing what I nevertheless feel I
    could. Patience, however, will tell me, and it is really
    necessary.</p>

    <p>Give Jo many kind regards and keep well and write soon
    please. A handshake from</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
