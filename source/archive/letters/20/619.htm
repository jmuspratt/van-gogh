  <body>
    <p>Dear Mother,</p>

    <p>Toward the end of the year I come once more to say good day
    to you - you will say that I have forgotten that several times.
    <label content="health.general">It is a year since I fell ill, and it is difficult for me to
    say how far I have or have not recovered. I often feel much
    self-reproach about things in the past, my illness being more
    or less my own fault, in any case I doubt if I can make up for
    faults in any way.</p>

    <p>But reasoning and thinking about these things is sometimes
    so difficult, and sometimes my feelings overwhelm me more than
    before.</label></p>

    <p><label content="attitude.parents">And then I think so much of you and of the past. You and
    Father have been, if possible, even more to me than to the
    others, so much, so very much, and I do not seem to have had a
    happy character.</label> I discovered that in Paris, how much more Theo
    did his best to help Father practically than I, so that his own
    interests were often neglected. Therefore I am so thankful now
    that Theo has got a wife and is expecting his baby. Well, Theo
    had more self-sacrifice than I, and that is deeply rooted in
    his character. And after Father was no more and I came to Theo
    in Paris, then he became so attached to me that I understood
    how much he had loved Father. And now I am saying this to you,
    and not to him - it is a good thing that I did not stay in
    Paris, for we, he and I, would have become too interested in
    each other.</p>

    <p>And life does not exist for this, I cannot tell you how much
    better I think it is for him this way than in the past, he had
    too many tiresome business worries, and his health suffered
    from it.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">In the beginning when I fell ill, I could not resign myself
    to the idea of having to go into a hospital. And at present I
    admit that I should have been treated even earlier, but to err
    is human.</label></p>

    <p>A French writer says that all painters are more or less
    crazy, and though quite a lot can be said against this, it is
    certain that one gets too distrait in it. Whatever the truth of
    it may be, I imagine that here, where I don't have to worry
    about anything, etc., the quality of my work is
    progressing.</p>

    <p>And thus, I go on with relative calmness, and do my best in
    my work, and don't consider myself among the unhappy ones.</p>

    <p>For the moment I am working on <art id=0661>a picture of a path between
    the mountains and a little brook forcing its way between the
    stones.</art> The rocks are of a plain violet-grey or pink, with here
    and there palm bushes and a kind of broom, which has all kinds
    of colours, green, yellow, red, brown, all through the autumn.
    And the brook in the foreground, white and foaming like
    soapsuds, and farther on, reflecting the blue of the sky.</p>

    <p>And now the work that people do here at the moment is
    certainly quite different - with more colour, and drawn more
    boldly, than what they used to do in Holland in Schelfout's
    time, for instance. And yet one thing is simply the consequence
    of the other. For instance, at the time you knew old Van de
    Sande Bakhuysen and Jules Bakhuysen. Only a little while ago I
    thought of their work, and that with all the apparent
    difference, there is yet so little change in people's thoughts.
    Well, I believe that Jules Bakhuysen, for instance, would quite
    well understand what I am painting these days - this ravine
    with the brook, and <art id=0652>another picture of the hospital park - big
    fir trees against an evening sky</art>.</p>

    <p>I hope Theo has sent you my studies, but I started <art id=0655>still
    another rather big picture for you of women gathering olives.
    The trees, grey-green, with a pink sky and a purplish soil. All
    the colours softer than usual</art>. I had hoped to
    send it one of these days, but it is drying slowly.</p>

    <p>As I told you, I am sometimes sorry that I am often so
    absent-minded, I struggle against it, but it makes me unable to
    do many things I ought to do. As for my health, there is
    literally nothing the matter with it, but the shock of last
    year makes me feel like not leaving the hospital. Sometimes I
    imagine that if I gave up painting and had to lead a hard life,
    say, as a soldier in the East, it would cure me. But it is
    somewhat late for that, and I am afraid I should be refused. I
    am thinking this half in jest, half in earnest.</p>

    <p>For the present my work is going well, but of course my
    thoughts are always directed on the colours and on drawing,
    going around in a rather small circle. So I want only to live
    by the day - trying to get on from one day to the other. And
    besides, my painter-friends also often complain that the
    profession makes one so powerless, or that it is the powerless
    who follow it.</p>

    <p>How much you will be thinking of Theo and Jo and the coming
    event. I hope from the bottom of my heart that it will go well.
    I am glad to be able to imagine how your house is after Wil's
    description of it.</p>

    <p>Is there any news of Cor? It is a very good thing that you
    are near Anna, and see your grandchildren about you. Give my
    kindest regards to all at Anna's, and my best wishes for the
    New Year.</p>

    <p>The weather here is rather soft these days, though there are
    also many days of frost and wind, but here the sun shines more
    strongly than in Holland. Do you remember that Rappard once
    said, &ldquo;It is sometimes refreshing,&rdquo; when he was
    staying with us after he had typhoid fever; I sometimes think
    of it when I am feeling much stronger and at times more
    clear-headed than last year.</p>

    <p>And now I wish you a happy Christmas and a good Old and New
    Year's Eve.</p>

    <p>An embrace in thought from,</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
