  <body>
    <p>St-R&eacute;my, April 29th 1889</p>

    <p> Sir,</p>
    <p>Yesterday Mr. Salles, the Protestant minister of Arles handed me your letter,
    which is at the same time a request for admission for your brother, a painter in Arles;
    he also told me the conditions that you want for your patient during his stay in the house;
    among these conditions there are some that will be a pleasure to grant him, but there is one
    that I cannot accept in advance, that of granting him permission to walk out of the establishment
    any time that he wants. You will understand, I hope, that under these conditions my responsibility
    would be strongly compromised, since I could not watch over him.</p>

    <p>What I can assure you in advance is that after I have observed your patient for some time
    and I have acquired the certainty that he can enjoy a greater liberty without inconveniences, I
    will be the first to grant it to him. </p>

    <p>As for doing painting and not to be sequestered in the establishment, I promise you that we
    will facilitate every means to allow him his natural tastes and, in the house, allow him the
    greatest liberty compatible with his mental state. </p>

    <p>In the same way, we will grant him wine with all his meals, especially since all my
    patients drink wine every day. I must tell you that in these conditions, the price of the
    pension remains fixed at 100 f. per month, and that it would be impossible for me to make
    a reduction. I have to add that you will have to pay, just for the first month, a supplement
    of ten francs for the medical certificate from the physician named by the administration
    to control the admissions of the patients; this expense is only payable for the first month. </p>

    <p>Medical treatment is given with the same solicitude for all classes of patients. </p>

    <p>I must ask you to give me his birth certificate at the time of admission. As for
    his clothing requirements needed to maintain the cleanliness of the patients, I have fixed
    this up with M. Salles, who will accompany him to St-R&eacute;my. </p>

    <p>Sincerely Yours.</p>

    <p>Dr. Th. Peyron.</p>
