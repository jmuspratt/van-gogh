    <p>W17 <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>Saint-R&eacute;my, 4 January 1890</p>

    <p>My dear sister,</p>

    <p>Just a few words to tell you that I am greatly pleased to
    know that you are in Paris with Theo and Jo. And it is not
    necessary to say that I think of you all every day.</p>

    <p>Fortunately another rather violent attack of exaltation or
    delirium is at an end and, if I may so say, I don't feel any
    after-effects at all; I feel the same as I do on ordinary days.
    And tomorrow I shall start working again if the weather
    permits. Today we are having very mild weather with spring
    sunshine, so to speak. Yesterday, while taking a walk, I saw
    chicory in bloom already in the meadows, and soon the daisies
    and violets will follow. I think the winter here very beautiful
    and absolutely the same as the North, only a little
    clearer.</p>

    <p>I sent a number of pictures to Paris yesterday. <sup>2</sup>
    I designated <art id=0655>the one with the olive trees</art> for you and Mother.
    You will see, I think, that in a white frame it will take on a
    mild colour, meaning the contrast between pink and green.</p>

    <p>Within a short time I shall send you some others, of
    mountains, and <art id=0652>a view of the garden here with tall pines</art>; they
    are drying at the moment.</p>

    <p>I will not write more today, for this letter has got to go
    off. I am very pleased that you are there, and I hope that the
    great event will have a happy outcome for Jo.</p>

    <p>See you soon.</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>1. Written in French.</p>
