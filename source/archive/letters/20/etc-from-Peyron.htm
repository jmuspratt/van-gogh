  <body>
    <p>St.-R&eacute;my, 29 January 1889.</p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">I am writing to you on behalf of M. Vincent, who is the
    victim of another attack. I therefore confirm receipt of the
    registered letter you sent him and of a roll of papers sent by
    normal mail. M. Vincent was getting on very well and was
    completely himself when last week he wanted to go to Arles to
    see some people, and two days after he made the journey the
    attack took place. At present he is unable to do any work at
    all and only replies incoherently to any question put to him. I
    trust that this will pass again as it has done before.</label></p>

    <p>St.-R&eacute;my, 26 May 1889.</p>

    <p>In reply to your letter of the 23<sup>rd</sup> inst., I am
    pleased to tell you that since his entry into this house M.
    Vincent is completely calm and that he finds that his health is
    improving day by day.<label content="psychology.nightmares"> At first he was subject to painful
    nightmares with disturbed him, but he tells me that these bad
    dreams tend to disappear and become less and less intense, so
    that now he has a more peaceful and restoring sleep;</label> he also
    eats with a better appetite.</p>

    <p>To sum up: since his arrival here there has been a slight
    improvement in his condition which makes him hope for a
    complete recovery.</p>

    <p>He spends the entire day drawing in the park here, but as I
    find him entirely tranquil, I have promised to let him go out
    in order to find scenery outside this establishment.</p>

    <p>You ask for my opinion regarding the probable cause of his
    illness. I must tell you that for the time being I will not
    make any prognosis, but I fear that it may be serious, as I
    have every reason to believe that the attack which he has had
    is the result of a state of epilepsy and if this should be
    confirmed one should be concerned about the future.</p>

    <p>I hope to go to Paris in the course of June. It will be an
    honour to come and see you and talk to you about your patient
    better than one can do by letter&hellip;</p>

    <p>St.-R&eacute;my, 24 February 1890.</p>

    <p>I again confirm receiving the registered letter addressed to
    M. Vincent. <label content="health.mental">He had another attack, which prevents him from
    writing to you and which took place after a trip to Arles. I
    note that the attacks are becoming more frequent and take place
    quite suddenly after every journey he undertakes away from this
    house. </label>I do not believe he gives himself over to any excess
    when he is at liberty, for I have always known him sober and
    reserved. However, I am forced to recognize the fact that each
    time he undertakes a little journey he becomes ill. It will
    only be for a few days and he will regain his sanity as
    before.</p>

    <p>[Postscript] I have had to send two men with a carriage to
    fetch him from Arles, and it is not known where he spent the
    night from Saturday to Sunday. <art id=0541>He had taken with him a painting
    of an Arl&eacute;sienne, </art>but it has not been found.</p>
