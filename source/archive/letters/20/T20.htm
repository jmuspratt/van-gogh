    <p>Letter T20<br>
     Paris, 16 November 1889</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>Enclosed I am sending you a letter from Gauguin which he
    sent me for you. The forest he speaks of in this letter has
    arrived too. What an excellent <i>workman</i> he is! This one
    has been executed with a care which must have cost him an
    enormous amount of labour. The figure of the woman especially,
    in polished wood, is very fine, whereas the surrounding figures
    are in rough coloured wood. It is obviously bizarre, and does
    not express a very sharply defined idea but it is like a piece
    of Japanese work, whose meaning, at least for a European, is
    equally difficult to grasp, but in which one cannot but admire
    the combination of the lines and the beautiful parts. The
    general effect has a very &ldquo;sonorous&rdquo; tone. I should
    very much like you to see it. You would undoubtedly love
    it.</p>

    <p>This week I went to see Bernard, who showed me what he had
    done recently. In my opinion he has made much progress. His
    drawing is less definite, but it is there for all that. There
    is more suppleness in his stroke. There is a more direct
    influence of the Primitives in him; for instance, he did a
    kneeling figure surrounded by angels. The ground is covered
    with large tiles, and the figures are distributed as on a
    chessboard, but there is one figure of an angel which really
    has nobility. He has also done a Christ in the olive grove.
    <sup>1</sup> Christ with red hair and a yellow angel.</p>

    <p>It is very difficult to understand, and the search for a
    style often lends the figures a ridiculous quality, but perhaps
    something good will come of it. If one sees a great many
    pictures, so many that now and then one wishes not to see any
    for some time, those which satisfy one most under those
    circumstances are the wholesome, true things without all that
    business of schools and abstract ideas.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you will tell me that every work of art must of
    necessity be the result of a great number of complicated
    combinations. That is true, but for the painter too there must
    come moments when he is so inspired by his subject or theme
    that he renders it in such a way that one can know, or at least
    feel, it like a thing you are simply confronted with. I feel
    this when I stand before many of your canvases. At the moment
    there is one in the show window at Tangui's, a view of the
    countryside in spring with poplars that run across the canvas
    in such a way that one can see neither the bottoms nor the tops
    of the trees. I am enormously fond of it. Truly this is pure
    nature.</p>

    <p>A letter came for you this morning from the &ldquo;XX&rdquo;
    at Brussels. I have put your address on it. A note from Maus,
    which I received at the same time, tells me that they will be
    happy if you will send in things, paintings and drawings. When
    he came here he liked <art id=0516>the apple trees in bloom</art>
    very much, but Van Rysselberghe knew better what you are after
    in your more recent things, the portrait of Roulin, the
    sunflowers, etc. It is necessary for you to tell me what you
    think of the exhibition, and what you would like to send. I
    think there are from 5 to 7 meters of ledge length. For this
    year they invited Puvis de Chavannes, Bartholom&eacute;,
    C&eacute;zanne, Dubois, Pillot, Forain, Signac, L.
    Pissarro, Hayet, Renoir, Sisley and de Lautrec, and you.
    However bad the exhibition of the Independents was, the
    <art id=0608>&ldquo;Irises&rdquo;</art> was seen by a lot of
    people, who now talk to me about them every once in a while. It
    would be a good thing if we could have a regular exhibition in
    Paris of the works of artists who are not well known to the
    public but it is almost unavoidable that this should be a
    permanent exhibition. The places here are so expensive that
    this will always be an obstacle. Pissarro wrote me that his
    wife and he have been looking around the country for a
    boardinghouse for you, but he tells me he thinks that it will
    be better for you to go stay with that doctor in Auvers. He
    will have to go to him very soon. I am pleased to hear that you
    are feeling better; the stronger you are physically, the
    better. Please tell me what the condition of your clothes is.
    Don't you want something warm?</p>

    <p>Fortunately Jo is well, she gives you her kind regards;
    winter is beginning to make itself felt here already.</p>

    <p>Does the mistral blow at St. R&eacute;my as it does in
    Arles?</p>

    <p>A cordial handshake and</p>

    <p>All yours, Theo</p>
