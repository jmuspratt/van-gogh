  <body>
    <p>St-R&eacute;my, May 26th 1889</p>

    <p> Sir,</p>
    <p>In Answer to your letter of the 23rd inst., I have the satisfaction of telling you that
    Mr. Vincent has been perfectly calm since his entry into the house, and that every day he
    observes that his health improves.<label content="psychology.nightmares"> In the beginning he was subject to distressing nightmares
    which troubled him, but he observes that these distressing dreams have tended to disappear
    and decrease in intensity, resulting in a more restful and restorative sleep for him;</label> he also
    has a better appetite.</p>

    <p>In short, since his entry he has made a slight improvement in his state and this makes him
    hope for a complete recovery in the future. </p>

    <p>He is occupied all day drawing in the park, where he now is, but since I see he is perfectly
    calm, I promised him that I would allow him to go to see different points of view
    outside of the establishment. </p>

    <p><label content="health.mental">You ask me for my opinion on the likely course of his malady; I must tell you that I
    reserve my prognosis for the moment, but I am afraid it is serious, because I have reason
    to believe that the attack that he had was caused by an epileptic condition, and if
    this is confirmed it will be necessary to be concerned for the future.</label> </p>

   <p>I intend to go to Paris during the month of June. I will have the honour of seeing you
    and better acquaint you about your patient than one can do by letter. </p>

    <p>Sincerely Yours.</p>

    <p>Dr. Th. Peyron.</p>
