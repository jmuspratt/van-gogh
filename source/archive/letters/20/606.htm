  <body>
    <p>Dear Mother,</p>

    <p>To begin with, I want to congratulate you, though late, upon
    your birthday.</p>

    <p>Twice already I started a letter, which I put away again, as
    my head did not feel like writing. How much I agree with you in
    seeking other surroundings after Cor's departure, for some
    time.</p>

    <p>There was much news in your latest letters: first the
    particulars of Cor's departure, and further that you are going
    to move in November. I can understand that you prefer to be
    nearer your grandchildren. Yet it will be a strange feeling to
    think that none of us has stayed in Brabant.</p>

    <p>I intend to send you a picture shortly, and one to Wil too;
    I am working on them and will surely have them ready by the end
    of the month. But it may still be a fortnight before they are
    dry enough to be sent off.</p>

    <p>These last weeks I have been, as far as my health is
    concerned, quite well, and</p>

    <p>I am working from morning till evening almost without
    interruption, day after day, and I lock myself up in the studio
    to have no distraction. Thus it is a great consolation for me
    that the work is progressing instead of declining, and that I
    do it with absolute calmness and that in this respect my
    thoughts are quite clear and conscious. And so, compared with
    others here who cannot do anything, I certainly have no reason
    to complain.</p>

    <p>Recently I wrote Theo that I should like to be less far away
    from Paris for a while, and probably something will come of
    this. Not that I am unwilling to yield my freedom for the sake
    of being less trouble to others when it becomes too bad, but
    for the moment it comes to about the same thing. And there are
    so many among the artists who - notwithstanding nervous
    diseases or epileptic fits from time to time - nevertheless go
    ahead, and in a painter's life it seems to be enough to make
    paintings, but also one has to be careful not to spoil one's
    connections with other painters. My health during the intervals
    is so good, and <label subject="health.gastrointestinal.stomach">
    my stomach so much better than before,</label> that I
    believe it will still take years before I am quite incapable,
    which I feared in the beginning would be the case
    immediately.</p>

    <p>However, I fear I shall again find out in the course of time
    that not every procrastination is a thief of time when one has
    to do with illness. But there seems to be no rule for it, and
    the physician repeated to me several times that one cannot say
    anything about it beforehand. But if one knows that it is a
    chronic disease, you will understand that one, though
    absolutely perplexed in the beginning, gets used to the
    thought, and then considers what one can still do. And this
    might be even more than one expects.</p>

    <p>In the beginning I was so dejected that I had no desire even
    to see my friends again and to work, and now the desire for
    these two things is stirring, and then there is the fact that
    one's appetite and health are perfect during the intervals. And
    I am so longing for Theo and his wife, whom I haven't even seen
    yet, and I am interested in everything. And when I think that
    this is no time for me to look for new friends, I think that
    much more of my present and former friends.</p>

    <p>Yet I understand that I must not ponder this too deeply, as
    it may have to be settled quite differently than I sometimes
    imagine, and besides I do not cherish any definite desire. Only
    I am anything but patient when I am not feeling well, though I
    have a rather solid stock of patience for my work. But that is
    literally all.</p>

    <p>As often as I have the chance, I work at portraits, which I
    myself sometimes think are better and more serious than the
    rest of my work. And if it might happen that my condition
    allows me to go back to Paris or its vicinity, that will
    probably be the important thing for me.</p>

    <p>And now I say goodbye to you for today, forgive my not
    writing before, and I hope to send you the paintings I am
    making for you shortly. Embracing you in thought,</p>

    <p>Your loving Vincent</p>
