  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter and the 150 francs, which I handed
    over to M. Peyron, asking him once more to tell you each month
    if there had been any expenses or not - so that it does not
    accumulate - <label content="art.supplies">I also have to thank you for a package of paints,
    and finally, last night the canvas arrived and the Millet
    reproductions, of which I am very glad</label>. M. Peyron said to me
    again that there is a considerable improvement and that he has
    good hopes for me - and that he has no objection to my going to
    Arles just now.</p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">And yet very often terrible fits of depression
    come over me,</label> and besides the more my health comes back to normal, the more
    my brain can reason coldly, the more foolish it seems to me,
    and a thing against all reason, to be doing this painting which
    costs us so much and brings in nothing, not even the outlay.
    Then I feel very unhappy, and the trouble is that at my age it
    is damnably difficult to begin anything else.</p>

    <p>In some Dutch newspaper which you put in with the Millets -
    I notice some Paris letters that I attribute to Isa&auml;cson.</p>

    <p>They are very subtle and one guesses the author to be a
    sorrowful creature, restless, with a rare tenderness - a
    tenderness which makes me instinctively think of H. Heine's
    Reisebilder.</p>

    <p>No need to tell you that I think what he says of me in a
    note extremely exaggerated, and that's another reason why I
    should prefer him to say nothing about me. And in all these
    articles I find, side by side with very fine things, something,
    I don't quite know what, that seems to me unhealthy.</p>

    <p>He has stayed in Paris a long time - I suppose he is wiser
    than I, and has not been drinking, etc., but all the same I
    find in him again, as it were, my own mental weariness of
    Paris. And I think that soon his spirit will become dimmed with
    sadness, wearied out with the fixed idea of seeking after what
    is good, if he stays there much longer. You feel so much in
    what he says that he's a grievously suffering human being, and
    is very kind, happy when he can admire.</p>

    <p>I began <art id=0648>the &ldquo;Diggers&rdquo; this morning on a size 30 canvas</art>.</p>

    <p>You know, it might be interesting to try to do Millet's
    drawings in painting, that would be quite a special collection
    of copies, something like the works of Pr&eacute;vot, who
    copied the less known Goyas and Vel&agrave;squezes for
    M. Doria. Perhaps I should be more useful doing that than doing
    my own painting. Mother has also written me news of Cor.</p>

    <p>I have worked on <art id=0646>a study of the fever ward at the Arles
    Hospital</art>, and then having had no more canvas
    these last days, I have taken long walks in all directions
    across the country. I am beginning to feel more the total
    effect of the scenery in which I am living. In the future I
    shall perhaps come back again and again to the same subjects of
    Provence.</p>

    <p>What you say of Guillaumin is very true, he has found one
    true thing and contents himself with what he has found, without
    going off at random after divergent things, and in that way he
    will keep straight and become even stronger on these same very
    simple subjects. My word, he isn't far wrong, and I like that
    serenity of his tremendously. I hasten to finish this letter. I
    have already started writing you four times without being able
    to finish the letter.</p>

    <p>Ah, now certainly you are yourself deep in nature, since you
    say that Jo already feels her child move - it is much more
    interesting even than landscapes, and I am very glad that
    things should have changed so for you.</p>

    <p>How beautiful that Millet is, &ldquo;A Child's First
    Steps&rdquo;!</p>

    <p>A handshake for you and Isa&auml;cson, kindest
    regards, especially to Jo. I am going to work again at the
    &ldquo;Diggers,&rdquo; the days are very short. Goodbye for
    now.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
