    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have already delayed too long in telling you of the safe
    receipt of your letter and enclosure.</p>

    <p>In any case I think it will do no harm if we see each other
    in Paris after a while. As to your letter, it is always the
    same, and as I see it, in judging me you rely too much on
    generalities and prejudices, which are too superficial and too
    incorrect for me to believe you will cling to them forever.</p>

    <p>I have been tremendously busy this week, for besides the
    painting class, I go and draw in the evening too, and after
    that, from half past ten till half past eleven, I work from the
    model at a club. For I have become a member of not less than
    two of these clubs, and I now know two fellows who draw well, I
    think, both Dutchmen.</p>

    <p>This week I painted a large thing with two nude torsos - two
    wrestlers posed by Verlat, and I like that very much. [Painting
    lost]</p>

    <p>And the same with the drawing from the plaster casts. I have
    now finished two large figures. At all events there are two
    things to be said for it, in the first place it interests me,
    after having drawn for years from fully clothed models, to see
    the nude again, and the works of the ancients, and to verify
    things.</p>

    <p>In the second place, to be accepted somewhere in Paris one
    must have worked somewhere else before, and not be absolutely
    green any more, and one is always involved with people who have
    already worked at an academy for a longer or shorter time.</p>

    <p>The advice Verlat gives me is very severe, and also what
    Vinck of the drawing class tells me, and they strongly advise
    me especially to draw for at least a year, <i>if possible</i>
    to draw nothing but plaster casts and the nude, and that this
    would be the <i>shortest</i> way, and I shall then go back to
    my other outdoor work or my portraits quite a different man;
    and I believe it is true, so I must try to be somewhere where
    both plaster casts and nude models are within my reach, at
    least at first.</p>

    <p>The best one in the class has done the same, and he says
    that with each study he felt he was making progress, and I have
    noticed it myself in his old things and his recent ones.</p>

    <p>I suppose you remember, &ldquo;Les Grecs ne prennent pas le
    contour, ils prennent par les milieux, par les noyaux.
    G&eacute;ricault a pris cela &agrave; Gros, qui lui l'avait
    pris des Grecs, mais G&eacute;ricault a voulu lui-m&ecirc;me le
    prendre aux Grecs aussi, et les a &eacute;tudi&eacute;s pour
    cela m&ecirc;me; apr&egrave;s Delacroix a fait comme
    G&eacute;ricault.&rdquo; [The Greeks did not start from the
    contour, they started from the centres, the nucli,
    G&eacute;ricault got it from Gros, who had got it from the
    Greeks, but G&eacute;ricault would also get it from the Greeks
    himself, for which very reason he studied them; later on
    Delacroix did the same as G&eacute;ricault.]</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">That method - Millet too draws in the same way, more than
    anybody else - is perhaps the root of all figure painting, it
    depends enormously on that drawing the modelling directly with
    the brush, quite a different conception from that of Bouguereau
    and others who lack interior modelling, who are <i>flat</i>
    compared with G&eacute;ricault and Delacroix, and do not emerge
    from the paint.</p>

    <p>With the latter - G&eacute;ricault, etc., - the figures have
    backs even when one sees them from the front, there is airiness
    around the figures - <i>they emerge from the paint</label></i>.</p>

    <p>It is to find this - about which I would not care to speak
    with Verlat, nor with Vinck - that I am working; no fear
    <i>they</i> would teach me this, for the fault of both of them
    is in the colour, which, as you know, isn't right in either's
    work.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">When I compare a study of mine with those of the other
    fellows, it is curious to see that they have almost nothing in
    common. Theirs have about the same colour as the <i>flesh</i>,
    so, seen close up, they are very correct - but if one stands
    back a little, they appear painfully flat - all that pink and
    delicate yellow, etc., etc., soft in itself, produces a harsh
    effect. The way I do it, from near by it is greenish-red,
    yellowish-grey, white-black and many neutral tints and most of
    them colours one cannot define. But when one stands back a
    little it emerges from the paint, and there is airiness around
    it, and a certain vibrating light falls on it. At the same
    time, the least little touch of colour which one may use as
    highlight is effective in it.</label></p>

    <p>But what I lack is practice, I must paint about fifty of
    them; I think I shall have reached something then. Now I put
    the colours on somewhat too <i>painstakingly</i>, because I
    haven't had enough practice; I must hesitate too long, and so I
    work the life out of it. But that is a question of time, of
    exercise, till the touch becomes more immediately correct, the
    better one has it fixed in one's mind.</p>

    <p>Some of the fellows have seen my drawings, one of them,
    influenced by the drawing of my peasant figures, has started at
    once to draw the model in the nude class with a much more
    vigorous modelling, putting the shadows down firmly. He showed
    me this drawing and we talked it over; it was full of life, and
    it was the finest drawing I have seen here by any of the
    fellows. Do you know what they think of it here? The teacher
    Sibert expressly sent for him, and told him that if he dared to
    do it again in the same way he would be considered to be
    mocking his teacher. And I assure you, it was the only drawing
    that was well done, like Tassaert or Gavarni. So you see how
    things are. However, it doesn't matter, and one must not get
    angry at it, but pretend one should like to cure oneself of the
    bad habit, but unfortunately one falls back into it all the
    time. The figures they draw are almost always top-heavy and are
    toppling over head first, not a single one <i>is standing</i>
    on its feet.</p>

    <p>And that <i>standing</i> must already be fixed <i>in the
    very first planning</i>.</p>

    <p>Well, I am still very pleased that I came here, whatever may
    happen, and whatever the results may be, whether I get along
    with Verlat or not.</p>

    <p>I find here the friction of ideas I want. I get a fresh look
    at my own work, can judge better where the weak points are,
    which enables me to correct them.</p>

    <p>But I most urgently beg you, for the sake of a good result,
    to lose neither your patience nor your good spirits; it would
    be fouling our own nest if we lost courage at the very moment
    that might give us a certain influence if we show that we know
    what we want, and dare to do something and to carry it
    through.</p>

    <p>As to the money, if I work in a studio and so don't have to
    pay the expenses for models, even then 150 fr. is certainly not
    much, for painting is very expensive, but <i>it can be done</i>
    if one economizes even on food, etc.</p>

    <p>But if models must be paid, 150 fr. is definitely <i>not
    enough</i> and one loses time, etc.</p>

    <p>So the cheapest way is to go on in the studio, seeing that,
    especially for more elaborate studies from the nude, it is
    impossible to provide the models oneself.</p>

    <p>I do not think it impossible that in the long run,
    especially if the other fellows can't help beginning to draw
    stronger shadows, that then Verlat or someone else will pick a
    fight with me, even if I systematically try to avoid it. Which
    I certainly shall do systematically, because it is to my
    advantage to stay here for some time.</p>

    <p>I am longing to hear about your apartment. As for me, if I
    come to Paris, I shall be perfectly contented with a cheap
    little room in some remote quarter (Montmartre) or a garret in
    a hotel, but that is relatively unimportant, and we aren't yet
    that far. First let's stay here for some time, and don't let's
    worry before it's time.</p>

    <p>The winter course ends on March 31.</p>

    <p>Good-by,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
