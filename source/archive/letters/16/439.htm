  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I must write you again to tell you that I have succeeded in
    finding a model. I have made two fairly big heads, by way of
    trial for a portrait. First, that <art id=0205>old man whom I wrote you
    about</art>, a kind of head like Hugo's; then also <art id=0206>a
    study of a woman</art>. In the woman's portrait I have brought
    lighter tones into the flesh, white tinted with carmine,
    vermilion, yellow and a light background of grey-yellow, from
    which the face is separated only by the black hair. Lilac tones
    in the dress.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">Rubens is certainly making a strong impression on me; I
    think his drawing tremendously good - I mean the drawing of
    heads and hands in themselves. I am quite carried away by his
    way of drawing the lines in a face with streaks of pure red, or
    of modeling the fingers of the hands by the same kind of
    streaks. I go to the museum fairly often, and then I look at
    little else but a few heads and hands of his and of Jordaens'.
    I know he is not as intimate as Hals and Rembrandt, but in
    themselves those heads are so alive.</label></p>

    <p>Probably I don't look at those which are generally admired
    most. I look for fragments like, for instance, those blonde
    heads in &ldquo;Ste. Th&eacute;r&egrave;se au
    Purgatoire.&rdquo; I am now looking for a blonde model just
    because of Rubens. But you must not be angry if I tell you that
    I cannot make both ends meet this month. <label content="art.materials">I have bought some
    more colours and two new kinds of drawing brushes which suit me
    splendidly and with which I can work more accurately.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">Then the canvases which I brought with me were too small for
    the heads, because by using other colours I need more space for
    the surroundings.</label></label></p>

    <p>All that and the models are ruining me.</p>

    <p>I tell you this as emphatically as possible, because when
    losing time one loses doubly.</p>

    <p>In the last days of this month, after I have done some more
    heads, I hope to paint a view on the Scheldt, for which I have
    already bought a canvas. I can also go there in bad weather, to
    an inn at St. Anne's, that is on the other side, opposite the
    Lieve Vrouwekerk [Our Lady's Church]. Other painters have
    worked there before.</p>

    <p>I am very glad I came here, for in many ways it is useful
    and necessary for me.</p>

    <p>I made the acquaintance of Tyck, the best colour
    manufacturer here, and he was very kind in giving me
    information about some colours. About green colours, for
    instance, that are fast. I also asked him things about Rubens's
    technique, which he answered in a way that proved to me how
    well he analyzes the material used, which not everybody does,
    although it is very useful.</p>

    <p>What more shall I tell you? Oh yes, I have seen two
    collections of modern pictures, first, what was bought at the
    exhibition for the raffle, and then a collection of pictures
    that was for sale.</p>

    <p>So I saw several fine things, two studies by Henri de
    Braekeleer; you know that he is absolutely different from the
    old De Braekeleer, I mean the one who is a famous colourist,
    and who analyzes rigorously. He is somewhat like Manet, that is
    to say as original as Manet.</p>

    <p>One study was of a woman in a studio, or some such interior,
    with Japanese objects; the woman wore a costume of yellow and
    black. The flesh colour, white with carmine. In the
    surroundings, all kinds of quaint little tones. The other one
    was a half-finished study of a landscape. Yellow, faded, flat
    fields &agrave; perte de vue [as far as the eye can see],
    crossed by a black cinder path, with a ditch alongside; over
    it, a sky of lilac gray, with accents of carmined lilac. Far
    away the little red patch of vermilion of a roof, and two
    little black trees. Hardly anything, and yet for me a great
    deal, because of the peculiar sentiment in the juxtaposition of
    colours. I also saw an old study by De Groux, a woman beside a
    cradle, somewhat like an old Isra&euml;ls.</p>

    <p>Further, what shall I say about those modern pictures? I
    thought many of them <i>splendid</i>, and then I mean
    especially the work of the colourists, or of those who try to
    be so, who look everywhere for mother-of-pearl-like
    combinations in the light parts. But to me it is not always
    perfect by a long shot; it is too affected. I prefer to see a
    simple brush stroke and a less far-fetched, difficult colour.
    More simplicity, in short that intelligent simplicity which is
    not afraid of frank technique.</p>

    <p>I like Rubens just for his ingenuous way of painting, his
    working with the simplest means.</p>

    <p>I don't count Henri de Braekeleer among those who look for
    mother-of-pearl effects everywhere, because his is a curious,
    very interesting endeavor to be literally true, and he stands
    quite apart. I also saw various gray paintings, including a
    printing shop by Mertens, a picture by Verhaert representing
    his own studio, where he himself is sitting etching and his
    wife standing behind him.</p>

    <p>By La Rivi&egrave;re - an Amsterdam hired mourner after a
    funeral, <i>very fine</i> in the black tones, a Goya-like
    conception; that little picture was a masterpiece. In both
    collections I saw very beautiful landscapes and marines. But as
    to the portraits - those I remember best are the
    &ldquo;Fisherboy&rdquo; by Frans Hals, &ldquo;Saskia&rdquo; by
    Rembrandt, a number of smiling or weeping faces by Rubens.</p>

    <p>Ah, a picture must be painted - and then why not simply? Now
    when I look into real life - I get the same kind of
    impressions. I see the people in the street very well, but I
    often think the servant girls so much more interesting and
    beautiful than the ladies, the workmen more interesting than
    the gentlemen; and in those common girls and fellows I find a
    power and vitality which, if one wants to express them in their
    peculiar character, ought to be painted with a firm brush
    stroke, with a simple technique.</p>

    <p>Wauters understood this, used to at least, for so far I
    haven't seen any work of his here. What I admire so much in
    Delacroix, too, is that he makes us feel the life of things,
    and the expression, and the movement, that he <i>absolutely
    dominates his colours</i>.</p>

    <p>And in a great many of the good things I saw, though I
    admire them, there is often far too much paint. At present I am
    getting more and more in the habit of talking to the models
    while painting, to keep their faces animated.</p>

    <p>I have discovered a woman - she is old now - who used to
    live in Paris and provided the painters with models, for
    instance, Scheffer, Gigoux, Delacroix and another one who
    painted <art id=phryne>a Phryne</art>.</p>

    <p>Now she is a washerwoman and knows a lot of women, and could
    always supply some, she said.</p>

    <p>It has been snowing, and the city was splendid early this
    morning in the snow, fine groups of street cleaners.</p>

    <p>I am glad I came here, for I am already full of ideas, also
    for the time when I shall be in the country again.</p>

    <p>It was in the Etoile Belge, I think, that I read an article
    by Eug&egrave;ne Battaille, reprinted from the Figaro, about
    conditions in Paris, an article which impressed me as being
    very well thought out; but according to him conditions in
    general are very bad. This Mr. Battaille has, contrary to the
    opinion of the Dutch journalists, expressed himself in
    Amsterdam pessimistically about the state of affairs in
    Holland.</p>

    <p>As to art dealing - as I have already written you, the
    dealers here complain like mis&egrave;re ouverte. And yet I
    believe that so much might still be done. To mention one thing,
    for instance, one sees no pictures in the caf&eacute;s,
    restaurants, caf&eacute;-chantants, at least hardly any. And
    how contrary this is to nature. Why don't they hang still lifes
    there, like the splendid decorations Fijt, Hondekoeter and so
    many others made in times of old? Why not women's portraits, if
    they want prostitutes? I know one must work cheaply for such
    purposes, but one can work relatively cheaply. Raising prices
    to such a height is the trade's ruin, and leads to no good
    after all.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, write again between times if you can. As to the
    money, do what you can, but remember that we must try our
    utmost to succeed. And I won't let that idea of painting
    portraits go, for it is a good thing to fight for, to show
    people that there is more in them than the photographer can
    possibly get out of them with his machine.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I have noticed the great number of photographers here, who
    are just about the same as everywhere, and seem to be pretty
    busy.</p>

    <p>But always those same conventional eyes, noses, mouths -
    waxlike and smooth and cold.</p>

    <p>It cannot but always remain <i>lifeless</i>.</p>

    <p>And the painted portraits have a life of their own, coming
    straight from the painter's soul, which the machine cannot
    reach. The more one looks at photographs, the more one feels
    this, I think.</p>
