    <p>Letter 440<br>
     Antwerp c. 15 December 1885</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">Today for the
    first time I feel rather faint - I had painted
    a picture of &ldquo;Het Steen&rdquo; and went to show it to
    some dealers. <label content="business.selling">Two of them were not at home, and one did not
    like it, and one complained bitterly that in a fortnight
    literally not a single person had shown his face in the store.
    This is not very encouraging, especially when the weather is
    chilly and gloomy, and when one has changed one's last 5-franc
    piece and doesn't know how to get through the next two
    weeks.</label></p>

    <p>Oh dear. Do try to keep me afloat these two weeks, for I
    want to paint some more figures. This morning I heard it said
    that some of those pictures I wrote you about had been sold
    privately - there was a rumour of 21,000 fr. I don't know if it
    is true, but at all events there was a crowd of spectators when
    I was there, and the exhibition for the raffle was also
    crowded. If there were more better things on view, more
    business would be done. But the shops have a desolate aspect.
    The picture of &ldquo;Het Steen&rdquo; is rather elaborate, and
    I shall make another one from a different spot on the quay.
    [Both paintings lost]</p>

    <p>But I greatly prefer to paint the figure, I also believe the
    market might be overloaded with landscapes, and though painting
    the figure presents more difficulties because of the models,
    yet after all it gives perhaps a better chance. What the
    dealers say is that women's heads or women's figures are most
    likely to sell.</p>

    <p>This spring I shall have to decide whether I shall stay in
    the neighbourhood of Nuenen or not. I should like to hear your
    opinion on the matter.</p>

    <p>I cannot understand why Portier, after his first favourable
    impression of my work, has become so absolutely indifferent to
    it since then. I cannot get on when I must spend <i>more</i> on
    colour than I receive, and I am not the least bit, literally
    not the least bit, better off than I was years ago, that winter
    in Brussels. Then I received 50 fr. less, but painting costs me
    much more than 50 fr., and it has to be paid on the spot.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.malnutrition">I do not feel faint as long as I am painting, but in the
    long run those intervals are always sometimes rather too
    melancholy, and it grieves me when I don't get on, and am
    always in a bad fix. Do you know, for instance, that in the
    whole time I've been here, I've only had three warm meals, and
    for the rest nothing but bread? In this way one becomes
    vegetarian more than is good for one. Especially as it was the
    same thing in Nuenen for half a year, and even then I could not
    pay my colour bill.</label></p>

    <p>Painting is expensive, yet one must paint a great deal. I
    have half a promise of a model to sit for a portrait, I would
    do my utmost to get her. Now what I cannot understand is that
    people like Portier, like Serret, for instance, if they cannot
    sell, do not at least see their way of getting me some work or
    other.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">Listen, Theo, another thing - I don't think it will seem
    incomprehensible to you that I haven't had the slightest
    inclination to write to the people at home when they are
    staying with my charming sister Anna or with other, to me,
    equally charming members of the family.</label></p>

    <p><label content="attitude.Mother">As I have received a letter from Mother asking me to write
    her and informing me that she has asked you to give her my
    address, will you let them know that I am not going to write,
    which for that matter I told them quite simply when I went
    away. You will understand that things like what happened in
    March are decisive.</p>

    <p>Then I left the house, from which may be inferred as a
    matter of course that they got what <i>they</i> wanted; for the
    rest, I think of them extremely, extremely little, and I do not
    desire them to think of me, as far as that goes.</label></p>

    <p><label content="attitude.Father">Certainly it is regrettable that such things much happen.
    But then, you see, there are certain recollections as, for
    instance, that up to the last Father spoke and behaved toward
    me, really, in the same way as the Roman Catholic priest. Can't
    they understand of their own accord that, for the very reason
    that you no longer feeling angry, you have definitely become
    more estranged from them than if they were strangers?</label></p>

    <p>Tell Mother so, if you like, for I do not want to say a
    harsh word to her, but I positively decline to write. And
    Mother is old, so I do not want to tell her sharply that I
    refuse to write. Such things have happened to other painters
    too, and it is one of those things it is better to leave
    alone.</p>

    <p>At the museum there is a portrait of Delroche painted by
    Portaels. During his life he seemed such a big man, but how
    hollow and empty he proved to be afterward! Manet and Courbet
    did not <i>seem</i> serious during their lives, yet how they
    proved themselves to be real painters!</p>

    <p>By a curious mishap an accident has happened to the portrait
    of Delaroche, so that a hole was cut right in the middle of the
    forehead. It looks well, and really seems to belong to it. Ah!
    there is quite a curious race of people of whom one would not
    oppose at certain moments that they are actually absolutely
    hollow and empty. One can be mistaken. And sometimes it is
    quite refreshing to perceive one has been mistaken, though then
    one has to begin all over again from the very beginning.
    Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
