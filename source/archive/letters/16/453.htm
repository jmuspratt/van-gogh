  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I write you often these days, and I often write the same
    thing, but let it prove to you that I have one thing especially
    in mind - the necessity of entering that period of figure
    drawing.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">And then it may be egoistic if you like, I want my health
    restored. My impression of the time I have spent here does not
    change either; in a certain sense I am very much disappointed
    by what I have made here, but my ideas have been modified and
    refreshed, and that was the real object of my coming here. But
    as I have perceived that I relied too much on my health, and
    that, though the core is still all right, yet I am but a ruin
    compared to what I might have been, so it would not astonish me
    at all if you, too, were absolutely in need of that same more
    hygienic life that was prescribed for me.</label></p>

    <p>If I am not mistaken in this, I think we cannot join each
    other soon enough, and I keep objecting to a stay in the
    country. For though the air is bracing, I should miss there the
    distraction and the pleasant company of the city, which we
    should enjoy so much more if we were together. And if we were
    together soon, I should disappoint you in many things, yes, to
    be sure, but not in every-thing, and not in my way of looking
    at things, I suppose.</p>

    <p>Now that we are discussing things, I want to tell you to
    begin with that I wish both of us might find a wife in some way
    or other before long, for it is high time, and if we should
    wait too long, we should not be the better for it.</p>

    <p>But I say this in all calmness. However, it is one of the
    first requisites for our more hygienic life. And I mention it
    because in that respect we may have to overcome an enormous
    difficulty, on which a great deal depends. And herewith I
    break the ice on the subject; we shall always have to return to
    it. And in the intercourse with women one especially learns so
    much about art.</p>

    <p>It is a pity that, as one gradually gains experience, one
    gradually loses one's youth. If that were not so, life would be
    too good.</p>

    <p>Have you already read that preface to Ch&eacute;rie by de
    Goncourt? The amount of work those fellows have achieved is
    enormous when one thinks of it.</p>

    <p>It is such a splendid idea, that working and thinking
    together. And every day I find new proof of the theory that the
    main reason for much misery among the artists lies in their
    discord, in their not co-operating, not being good but false to
    each other. And now, if we were more sensible in that respect,
    I do not doubt for a moment that within a year's time we should
    make headway, and be happier. I am not getting on very well
    with my work, but I do not force things, because in fact I am
    almost completely forbidden to.</p>

    <p>And I want to keep up my strength for that first time in
    Paris, if that is to follow first, without any other interval
    than that one month in the country. For should like to go there
    in good condition.</p>

    <p>It was Sunday today, almost a spring day. This morning I
    took a long walk alone all through the city, in the park, along
    the boulevards. The weather was such that I think in the
    country they will have heard the lark sing for the first
    time.</p>

    <p>In short, there was something of resurrection in the
    atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Yet what depression there is in business and among the
    people. I do not think it exaggerated to be pessimistic about
    the various strikes, etc., everywhere.</p>

    <p>They will certainly prove not to have been useless for the
    following generations, for <i>then</i> they will have proved a
    success. But now it is of course hard enough for everybody who
    must earn his bread by his work, the more so because we can
    foresee that it will get worse and worse from year to year. The
    labourer against the bourgeois is as justifiable as was the
    tiers &eacute;tat against the other two a hundred years ago.
    And the best thing to do is to keep silent, for fate is not on
    the bourgeois side, and we shall live to see more of it; we
    are still far from the end. So although it's spring, how many
    thousands and thousands are wandering about, desolate.</p>

    <p>I see the lark soaring in the spring air as well as the
    greatest optimist; but I also see the young girl of about
    twenty, who might have been in good health, a victim of
    consumption, and who will perhaps drown herself before she dies
    of any illness.</p>

    <p>If one is always in respectable company among rather
    well-to-do bourgeois, one does not notice this so much perhaps,
    but if one has dined for years on la vache enrag&eacute;e, as I
    have, one cannot deny that great misery is a fact that weights
    the scale.</p>

    <p>One may not be able to cure or to save, but one can
    sympathize with and pity them. Corot, who after all had more
    serenity than anybody else, who felt the spring so deeply, was
    he not as simple as a workingman all his life, and so sensitive
    to all the miseries of others? And what struck me in his
    biography was that when he was already very old in 1870 and
    1871, he certainly looked at the bright sky, but at the same
    time he visited the ambulances where the wounded lay dying.</p>

    <p>Illusions may fade, but the sublime <i>remains</i>. One may
    doubt everything, but one does not doubt people like Corot and
    Millet and Delacroix. And I think that in moments when one does
    not care for nature any more, one still cares for humanity.</p>

    <p>If you can, send me something extra this month, be it more
    or less, even if it's only 5 francs, do so. If you can't, then
    it can't be helped.</p>

    <p>I am greatly longing to know your decision, if perhaps you
    would approve of my coming to Paris already about April 1. At
    all events write soon about it.</p>

    <p>Goodbye. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
