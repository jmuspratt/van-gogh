  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I want to tell you that I am in Antwerp, and that I already
    have seen a few things. I have taken a room for 25 fr. a month,
    No. 194 Rue des Images, over a colour dealer's. So when you
    write, kindly send your letter to that address, instead of c/o
    G.P.O.</p>

    <p>I shall begin by telling you that I saw Ley's dining hall,
    you know, &ldquo;The Walk on the Ramparts,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
    Skaters,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Reception&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
    Table,&rdquo; and on a panel between the windows &ldquo;St.
    Luc.&rdquo; To my astonishment the composition was somewhat
    different from the ultimate compositions, at least I imagine so
    - although I have not yet been able to compare photos of the
    <i>pictures</i> with them.</p>

    <p>Then, it was painted in fresco - i.e. on the plaster of the
    wall. Now fresco really must and can last for centuries, but
    these have already faded considerably, and the one over the
    mantlepiece especially (part of &ldquo;The Reception&rdquo;)
    already shows some cracks. The highly ingenious son of Baron
    Leys has also improved the hall by having a door enlarged so
    that in &ldquo;The Skaters,&rdquo; the legs of the fellows
    standing on the bridge looking over the railings have been cut
    away, which makes a deplorable effect. Besides, the light is
    terribly bad there; now that hall was originally painted - I
    imagine - to be used by lamplight. Therefore, because I
    honestly could not see anything, I gave the servant a tip and
    asked her to light the chandelier for me, and then I could see
    better.</p>

    <p>After so much that had rather disappointed me - in the first
    place that the colour of the fresco, and, alas, I am afraid
    <i>bad</i> fresco, is not what we are used to from Leys - after
    so much that disappointed me - after all it is superb.</p>

    <p>The maidservant, the woman near the baker's shop, the lovers
    and other figures in &ldquo;The Walk on the Ramparts&rdquo; -
    the bird's-eye view of the city, the silhouette of the towers
    and roofs against the sky, the bustle of skaters on the frozen
    moat - are superbly executed.</p>

    <p>I have also seen the museum of old pictures and the
    Mus&eacute;e Moderne. I agree with you that the figures on the
    first plane, those heads in &ldquo;Le Christ au
    Purgatoire,&rdquo; are <i>very</i> beautiful, finer than the
    rest, and than the principal figure; those two blonde women's
    heads especially are Rubens at his best.</p>

    <p>I was very much struck by Frans Hal's
    &ldquo;Fisherboy&rdquo;; Mr. De Vos - portrait of master of the
    guild - Rembrandt, <i>very</i> beautiful, two small Rembrandts,
    which perhaps are not by Rembrandt, but by N. Maes? or somebody
    else; Jordaens - &ldquo;a chip off the old block&rdquo;; Van
    Goyen, S. Ruysdael. And the Quentin Matsys; the drawing
    &ldquo;St. Barbara&rdquo; by Van Eyck, etc.</p>

    <p>In the Mus&eacute;e Moderne: the great Mols is Mesdag-like,
    with smears of Vollon plainly visible. (Vollon knew him well.)
    Braekleer, <i>not</i> the bad one - a Brabant inn, curiously
    fine, beautiful landscapes by C. de Cock, Lamorini&egrave;re,
    Coosemans, Asselbergs, Rosseels, Baron, Munthe, Achenbach, a
    good Clays, two old Leyses - one Braekleer-like, the other
    romantic, the latter good; a beautiful portrait by Ingres, a
    fine portrait by David, other good things, also horrible things
    like life-sized cows by the God-fearing Verboeckhoven, etc. But
    I have seen very little at the art dealers', next to nothing,
    one little painting the size of a hand, not even as good as
    Raffaelli, otherwise nothing special, and I am afraid that
    metaphorically business is at death's door. But - there is a
    good old Dutch proverb, &ldquo;Never despair.&rdquo; I like
    Antwerp, have explored the city in every direction; the quays
    are most characteristic.</p>

    <p>Well, it will never hurt knowing Antwerp a bit; it will
    probably prove to be like everything everywhere, namely
    disillusioning but with its own atmosphere.</p>

    <p>Besides, it is good to have a change now and then.</p>

    <p>Goodbye, write soon if you can.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
