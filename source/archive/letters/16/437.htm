  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I just wanted to send you a few more impressions of Antwerp.
    This morning I took a long walk in the pouring rain, the object
    of the outing being to fetch my things from the custom house.
    The various warehouses and storage sheds on the quays look
    splendid.</p>

    <p>I've walked in many different directions along the docks and
    quays several times already. The contrast is particularly
    marked for one who has just arrived from the sand and the heath
    and the tranquillity of a country village and has been in quiet
    surroundings for a long time. It's all an impenetrable
    confusion.</p>

    <p>One of de Goncourt's sayings was, &ldquo;Japonaiserie for
    ever.&rdquo; Well, those docks are one huge Japonaiserie,
    fantastic, peculiar, unheard of - or at any rate, that's one
    way of looking at them. I would love some day to take a walk
    there in your company, just to find out if we see things in the
    same way.</p>

    <p>Everything could be done there, townscapes, figures of the
    most diverse character, ships as the main subject with water
    and the sky a delicate grey - but, above all - Japonaiseries.
    The point I'm trying to make is that there are always figures
    in motion there, one sees them in the strangest setting,
    everything looks fantastic, with interesting contrasts at every
    turn. A white horse in the mud in a corner where piles of
    merchandise lie covered with a tarpaulin - against the old,
    black, smoke-stained walls of the warehouse. Perfectly simple,
    but with a Black and White effect.</p>

    <p>Through the window of a very elegant English public house
    one can look out on the filthiest mud and on a ship from which,
    say, such pleasing wares as hides and buffalo horns are being
    unloaded by docker types as ugly as sin, or by exotic sailors,
    while a very fair, very delicate English girl stands at the
    window looking out at this or at something else. The interior
    with figure wholly in tone, and for light - the silvery sky
    above the mud and the buffalo horns - again a series of fairly
    strong contrasts.</p>

    <p>Flemish sailors with excessively ruddy faces and broad
    shoulders, lusty and tipsy, Antwerpers through and through, are
    to be seen eating mussels or drinking beer with a great deal of
    noise and commotion. In contrast - there goes a tiny little
    figure in black, small hands clasped close to her body,
    scuttling noiselessly past the grey walls. In an encadrement
    [frame] of jet-black hair, a small oval face. Brown?
    Orange-yellow? I'm not sure. For a moment she looks up and
    gives a slanting glance from a pair of jet-black eyes. She is a
    Chinese girl, quiet as a mouse, stealthy, small, naturally
    bedbug-like. What a contrast to the group of Flemish
    mussel-eaters!</p>

    <p>Another contrast - one walks down a very narrow street
    between tremendously tall buildings, warehouses and
    storehouses. But at ground level in the street - alehouses for
    every nationality, with males and females to match, shops for
    food, for seamen's clothing, colourful and bustling. The street
    is long, at every turn one sees a typical scene, a commotion,
    perhaps, more intense than usual, as a squabble breaks out. For
    example, there you are walking along, just looking around - and
    suddenly cheers go up and there's a lot of yelling. A sailor is
    being thrown out of a brothel by the girls in broad daylight
    and is being pursued by a furious fellow and a string of
    prostitutes, of whom he seems to be terrified - anyway, I see
    him clamber over a pile of sacks and disappear through a window
    into a warehouse.</p>

    <p>When one has had enough of this hullabaloo - with the city
    behind one at the end of the landing stages where the Harwich
    and Havre steamers lie, there is nothing, absolutely nothing to
    be seen in front except for an infinite expanse of flat,
    half-flooded pasture, immensely melancholy and wet, with
    undulating dry reeds, and mud - the river with a single small
    black boat, water in the foreground grey, sky misty and cold,
    grey - still as the desert.</p>

    <p>As to the overall impression of the harbour, or of one of
    the docks - at one moment it is more tangled and fantastic than
    a thorn hedge, so chaotic that one finds no rest for the eye,
    grows giddy, and is forced by the &ldquo;papillot-ering&rdquo;
    [flickering. Vincent &ldquo;Dutchified&rdquo; the French
    <i>papillotement</i>] of colours and lines to look first here,
    then there, unable to distinguish one thing from another - even
    after looking at the same point for a long time. But if one
    moves on to a certain spot with an undefined stretch of land in
    the foreground, then one again encounters the most beautiful,
    most peaceful lines and those effects which Mols, for instance,
    so often achieves.</p>

    <p>Here one may se a splendidly healthy-looking girl, who is,
    or at least seems, wholly honest and unaffectedly cheerful;
    there a face so slyly vicious, like a hyena's, that it
    frightens one. Not to forget faces ravaged by smallpox, the
    colour of boiled shrimps, with dull, grey little eyes, no
    eyebrows and sparse, greasy, thinning hair the colour of pure
    hog bristle, or a bit yellower - Swedish or Danish types.</p>

    <p>I'd like to do some work around there, but how and where,
    for one would get into trouble exceedingly quickly. All the
    same I've roamed through quite a number of streets and
    alleyways without mishap, have even sat down to talk in a very
    friendly way with various girls, who seemed to take me for a
    bargee.</p>

    <p>I think it not unlikely that painting portraits may help me
    to come by some good models. I got my gear today, and some
    materials, to which I'd been looking forward very eagerly. So
    now my studio is all ready. If I could come by a good model for
    a song, I'd be afraid of nothing. Nor do I mind very much that
    I haven't enough money to force the pace. Perhaps the idea of
    doing portraits and getting the subjects to pay for them by
    posing is a safer method. You see, in the city things aren't
    the same as when one deals with peasants.</p>

    <p>Well, one thing is certain, Antwerp is a splendid and very
    remarkable place for a painter.</p>

    <p>My studio isn't at all bad, especially now that I've pinned
    up a lot of small Japanese prints which I enjoy very much. You
    know, those small female figures in gardens or on the beach,
    horsemen, flowers, gnarled thorn branches.</p>

    <p>I'm glad I came here - and hope not to sit still and do
    nothing this winter. Anyway, it's a relief to have a small
    hideaway where I can work when the weather is bad. It goes
    without saying that I won't be living in the lap of luxury.</p>

    <p>Try to send your letter off on the first, for while I've
    enough to live on until then, I shall be getting the wind up
    after that.</p>

    <p>My little room has turned out better than I expected and
    certainly doesn't look dreary.</p>

    <p><label content="business.selling">Now that I have the 3 studies I took along with me here, I
    shall try to make contact with the marchands de tableaux
    [picture dealers], who seem, however, to live for the most part
    in private houses, with no display windows giving on to the
    street.</label></p>

    <p>The park is beautiful too. I sat there one morning and did
    some drawing.</p>

    <p>Well - I've had no setbacks so far, and I'm well off as far
    as accommodation is concerned, for by sacrificing another few
    francs I've acquired a stove and a lamp. I shan't easily get
    bored, believe me.</p>

    <p>I've also found Lhermitte's <i>Octobre</i>, women in a
    potato field in the evening, splendid, but not his Novembre
    yet. Have you kept track of that by any chance? I've also seen
    that there's a Figaro illustr&eacute; with a beautiful drawing
    by Raffaelli.</p>

    <p>My address, as you know, is 194 Rue des images, so please
    send your letter there, and the second de Goncourt volume when
    you've finished with it. Regards,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>It's odd that my painted studies look darker here in the
    city than in the country. Is that because the light isn't as
    bright in the city? I'm not sure, but it might matter more than
    one might think at first sight. I was struck by it and can
    imagine that some of the things that are with you now also look
    darker than I thought they were in the country. Yet those I
    brought along with me don't seem the worse for it - the mill,
    avenue with autumn trees, a still life, as well as a few small
    things.</p>
