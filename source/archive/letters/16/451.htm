  <body>
    <p>Antwerp, 1<sup>st</sup> half February 1886</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I must write once again, for the sooner we can make up our
    minds, the better.</p>

    <p>As to a studio, if we can find in one and the same house a
    room with an alcove and also a garret or corner of an attic,
    then you could have that room and alcove, and we could make
    ourselves as comfortable as can be. And during the daytime the
    room might serve as a studio, and the garret would serve for
    various more or less unsightly implements, and for dirty work;
    besides, I could sleep there, and you in the alcove of the
    studio.</p>

    <p>Such an arrangement or something similar would be perfectly
    satisfactory for the first year, I think. What I am not sure of
    is whether we shall get on personally, though I don't despair
    of it, but it will be much more comfortable for you to come
    home in the evening to a studio than to an ordinary room which
    is always more or less dreary, and that dreariness is our worst
    enemy.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">As the doctor tells me that I must improve my physical way
    of living, who knows but what you also would feel better for
    such a measure. For you too are neither happy nor in
    sufficiently good spirits, let's call things by their names,
    you have too many cares and too little prosperity.</label></p>

    <p>But perhaps the fault is in ourselves, because we are both
    too isolated, and because our forces and resources are too much
    divided and therefore insufficient. So union is strength, that
    would be much better.</p>

    <p>So I think there must be more animation, and we must throw
    all doubts overboard, and also a certain lack of confidence. Do
    you want a <i>motive</i> for keeping one's serenity even when
    one is isolated and misunderstood, and has lost all chance for
    material happiness?</p>

    <p>This one thing remains - <i>faith</i>; one feels
    instinctively that an enormous number of things are changing
    and that everything will change. We are living in the last
    quarter of a century that will end again in a tremendous
    revolution.</p>

    <p>But suppose both of us see its beginning at the end of our
    lives. We certainly shall not live to see the better times of
    pure air and the rejuvenation of all society after those big
    storms.</p>

    <p>But it is already something not to be duped by the falsity
    of one's time, and to scent the unhealthy closeness and
    oppressiveness of the hours that precede the thunderstorm.</p>

    <p>And to say, We are still in the closeness, but the following
    generations will be able to breathe more freely.</p>

    <p>Zola and the de Goncourts believe in it with the
    simplicity of grown-up children. They, the most rigorous
    analysts whose diagnoses are both so merciless and so
    exact.</p>

    <p>And the very ones you have mentioned too, Turgenev and
    Daudet, they do not work without an aim or without looking
    ahead. But all avoid, and with reason, prophesying Utopias, and
    are pessimistic in that if one begins to analyze, the history
    of this country shows terribly clearly how revolutions may come
    to nothing, though they begin ever so nobly.</p>

    <p>You see the thing that supports one is that one doesn't
    always have to be alone with one's feelings and thoughts when
    one works and thinks together with other people.</p>

    <p>At the same time that increases one's strength, and one is
    infinitely happier.</p>

    <p>Now I have wanted it to be this way between us for a long
    time already, and I imagine if you stayed alone, you would get
    depressed, because times are not cheerful <i>unless one finds
    satisfaction in one's work</i>.</p>

    <p>I am sending you that novel by de Goncourt, especially for
    the preface, which gives a summary of their work and aims. You
    will see that those people have not been exactly happy, in the
    same way as Delacroix said of himself, &ldquo;Je n'ai pas du
    tout &eacute;t&eacute; heureux dans le sens ou je l'entendais,
    le d&eacute;sirais autrefois.&rdquo; [I have not been at all
    happy in the sense in which I understood, I desired it
    formerly.] Well it may come sooner or later, but for you too
    there will come a moment when you know <i>for sure</i> that all
    chance of material happiness is lost, fatally and irrevocably.
    I feel sure of it, but remember that at the same moment there
    will be a certain compensation in feeling the power to work
    within one's self.</p>

    <p>What cuts me to the heart is the beautiful serenity of the
    great thinkers of the present, as, for instance, that last walk
    of the two de Goncourts, of which you will read the
    description. The last days of the old Turgenev were the same
    way, too; he was with Daudet a great deal then. Sensitive,
    delicate, intelligent like women, also sensitive to their own
    suffering, and yet always full of life and consciousness of
    themselves, no indifferent stoicism, no contempt for life. I
    repeat - those fellows, they die the way women die. No fixed
    idea about God, no abstractions, always on the firm ground of
    life itself, and only attached to that. I repeat - like women
    who have loved much, hurt by life, and as Silvestre says of
    Delacroix, &ldquo;Ainsi il mourut presqu'en
    souriant.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Meanwhile we are not yet that far; on the contrary, we have
    to work first, to live first, although without happiness in the
    ordinary sense of the word.</p>

    <p>But whatever there may be of the future, you may be sure
    that I shall be very glad if I can work a year at Cormon's,
    unless there is a better opportunity for drawing at the Ecole
    des Beaux-Arts or some other studio that I have heard mentioned
    here.</p>

    <p>The ancients will not prevent us from being realistic, on
    the contrary. Of course I am also longing enormously for the
    French pictures.</p>

    <p>By the way - don't you like this little poem?</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    Tout le mal est venu de la femme - Raison<br>

    Obscurcie, app&eacute;tit de lucre, trahison<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>[Translation of the whole poem].</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    All evil has come from woman - Obscured reason, appetite for
    lucre, treachery...<br>

    Golden cups in which the wine is mixed with lees,<br>

    Every crime, every happy lie, every folly<br>

    Comes from her. Yet adore her, as the gods<br>

    Made her...and it is still the best thing they did.<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>After all painting has the secret of being able to give one
    a second youth.</p>

    <p>Tell me, have you ever read anything by Carlyle? Perhaps it
    is not even necessary if you only see the face of that man and
    know that his work is something like Michelet's; Whistler and
    Legros have both painted his portrait.</p>

    <p>He is also one who dared a great deal, and had a different
    insight into things than the rest. But always when I study the
    lives of such men, I find the same story, lack of money, bad
    health, opposition, isolation - in short, trouble from
    beginning to end.</p>

    <p>Mantz's article on Paul Baudry was very good, and I like
    this especially: &ldquo;Il a travaill&eacute; au renouvellement
    du sourire.&rdquo; [He has worked at the renewal of the
    smile.]</p>

    <p>Could one say of Delacroix, &ldquo;Il a travaill&eacute; au
    renouvellement de la passion&rdquo;? Perhaps so.</p>

    <p>Well, at all events write soon. Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
