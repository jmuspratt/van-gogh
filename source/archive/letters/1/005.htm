    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is time for you to hear from me again. I am longing to
    hear how you and Uncle Hein are, so I hope that you will be
    able to find time to write me.</p>

    <p>I suppose you have heard that I am going to London, probably
    very soon. I do hope that we shall see each other before then.
    If there is any chance, I shall go to Helvoirt at Easter, but
    that depends on Iterson, who is away on business. I cannot go
    away before he comes back.</p>

    <p>It will be quite a different life for me in London, as I
    shall probably have to live alone in rooms. I'll have to take
    care of many things I don't have to worry about now.</p>

    <p>I am looking forward very much to seeing London, as you can
    imagine, but still I am sorry to leave here. Now that it has
    been decided that I shall go away, I feel how strongly I am
    attached to The Hague. Well, it can't be helped, and I intend
    not to take things too hard. It will be splendid for my English
    - I can understand it well enough, but I cannot speak it as
    well as I would wish.</p>

    <p>I heard from Anna that you had your picture taken. If you
    have one to spare, don't forget me.</p>

    <p>How is Uncle Hein? Not better, I am afraid. And how is Aunt?
    Can Uncle keep himself busy, and does he suffer much pain? Give
    him my warmest regards. I think of him so often. How is
    business? I think you must be rushed with work; we certainly
    are here. You must feel at home in the business by this
    time.</p>

    <p>How is your boardinghouse - does it still please you? That's
    an important thing. <i>Be sure to tell me more about the
    pictures you see</i>. A fortnight ago I was in Amsterdam to see
    an exhibition of the pictures that are going from here to
    Vienna. It was very interesting, and I am curious to know what
    impression the Dutch artists will make in Vienna. I am also
    curious to see the English painters; we see so little of them
    because almost everything remains in England.</p>

    <p>In London Goupil has no gallery, but sells only directly to
    art dealers. Uncle Vincent will be here at the end of this
    month, and I am looking forward to hearing more particulars
    from him.</p>

    <p>The Haanebeeks and Aunt Fie always ask how you are and send
    you their best wishes. What delightful weather we are having! I
    enjoy it as much as I can; last Sunday I went out boating with
    Willem <sup>1</sup>. How I should have liked to stay here this
    summer, but we must take things as they are. And now adieu.
    Best wishes and write to me soon. Say goodbye for me to Uncle
    and Aunt, Mr. Schmidt and Eduard. I am looking forward to
    Easter.</p>

    <p>Always your loving brother, Vincent.</p>

    <p>Theo, <label subject="psychology.depression">I strongly
    advise you to smoke a pipe; it is a remedy for the blues, which I
    happen to have had now and then lately.</label>
    I just received your letter, many thanks. I like the photograph
    very much, it is a good likeness. I will let you know as soon
    as I know something more about my going to Helvoirt; it would
    be nice if you could come on the same day. Adieu.</p>
