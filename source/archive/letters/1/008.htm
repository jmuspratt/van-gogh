    <p>The Hague, 9<sup>th</sup> May 1873</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Monday morning I leave Helvoirt for Paris, and shall pass
    Brussels at 2.07 P. M. <label content="feelings.loneliness">Come
    to the station if you can, I should be so glad to see you.</label></p>

    <p>I must not forget to tell you that I showed your photograph
    to Mrs. Tersteeg, and she would like very much to have one. Is
    there a chance of your having another and sending it to me? If
    not now, maybe another time.</p>

    <p>Theo, you have no idea how kind everybody here is to me, and
    you can imagine how sorry I am to have to leave so many
    friends.</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy. Compliments to Uncle and Aunt, hope to see you
    soon.</p>

    <p>Vincent.</p>

    <p>Inquire if you have to be at the north or the south
    station.</p>
