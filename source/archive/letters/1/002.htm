    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">What good news I've just read in Father's letter. I wish you
    luck with all my heart. I'm sure you will like it there, it's
    such a fine firm. It will be quite a change for you.</p>

    <p>I am so glad that both of us are now to be in the same
    profession and in the same firm.</label> We must be sure to write to
    each other regularly.</p>

    <p>I hope that I'll see you before you leave, we still have a
    lot to talk about. I believe that Brussels is a very pleasant
    city, but it's bound to feel strange for you in the beginning.
    Write to me soon in any case. Well, goodbye for now, this is
    just a brief note dashed off in haste, but I had to tell you
    how delighted I am at the news. Best wishes, and believe me,
    always,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I don't envy you having to walk to Oisterwijk every day in
    this awful weather. Regards from the Roos family.</p>
