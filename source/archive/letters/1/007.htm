    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You must forgive me for having forgotten your birthday. My
    best wishes. I hope this year will be a happy one for you, and
    that you will like your work more and more.</p>

    <p>My time here is almost up. Next Saturday I go home to say
    goodbye, and then on to Paris on Sunday. I fear, however, that
    it will be Monday before I can start, and that I shall have to
    stay over in Helvoirt on Sunday. I hope that I shall be able to
    write you when I'll be passing through Brussels in time. I may
    not be able to, as I do not know for sure when I have to be in
    Paris.</p>

    <p>How are Uncle and Aunt - have they moved already? You must
    write me about this soon, my address is below. I am writing in
    a hurry; as you can imagine, I am very busy. Adieu, best
    wishes. Compliments to Uncle, Aunt, Mr. Schmidt and Eduard.</p>

    <p>Always your loving Vincent.</p>

    <p>V. W. van Gogh</p>

    <p>C/o Messrs. Goupil &amp; Co.,</p>

    <p>17 Southampton Street, Strand, London</p>

    <p>Don't forget to write <i>V. W. van Gogh</i>; otherwise it
    might be confused with Uncle Vincent's mail, he is only called
    <i>V</i>., you know.</p>
