  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter, I was glad to hear you arrived
    home safely. <label content="feelings.loneliness">I missed you the first few days and it felt
    strange not to find you there when I came home in the
    afternoons.</label></p>

    <p>We have had some enjoyable days together, and managed to
    take a few walks and see one or two sights between the spots of
    rain.</p>

    <p>What dreadful weather! You must have <i>sweltered</i> from
    the heat on your walks to Oisterwijk. There was harness racing
    yesterday for the Exhibition; but the illuminations and the
    fireworks were put off because of the bad weather, so it's just
    as well you didn't stay on to see them. Regards from the
    Haanebeek and Roos families.</p>

    <p>Always your loving Vincent.</p>
  </body>
