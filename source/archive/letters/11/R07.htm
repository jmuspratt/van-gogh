  <body>
    <p>Dear Rappard,</p>

    <p>I received your letter from Brussels. I do not like it at
    all, but no matter, for as you said yourself, you wrote it at a
    moment when you were somewhat abnormal. There is nothing, or
    hardly anything, in your letter that holds water. However, I am
    glad you are back from Brussels. In my opinion you do not
    belong there, and as for the &ldquo;technical
    proficiency&rdquo; you hope to acquire at the academy, I am
    much afraid your hopes will be deceived. Not even fellows like
    Stallaert can teach one.</p>

    <p>Now I am busy with all kinds of work, for I have rented a
    small studio that I shall move into by January 1, so I have to
    arrange a lot of things.</p>

    <p>When I have quieted down a bit later on, I shall write you
    again about all sorts of things in a calmer vein, but don't
    take it ill of me if at present I have more serious things to
    do than write letters.</p>

    <p>Of course my letters don't pretend to be invariably right,
    always to explain things correctly - oh no, I am often
    mistaken. But when I tell you, Rappard, that those academic
    fellows you are making so much of aren't worth a cent - and
    when I say this, I mean Stallaert and Severdonk - I am in dead
    earnest, and I tell you, If I were you, I'd let them go. But I
    have already told you so several times, and I won't repeat it.
    I won't hear another syllable about the whole academy, nor will
    I say another syllable about it - it really isn't worth the
    trouble. Herewith I send you my greetings - what kind of
    fellows are those artists with whom you drank a glass of
    lambiek <sup>1</sup> - why don't you mention the names of some
    of them? Are they fellows who might be important to you? I hope
    so, but I doubt it very much - goodbye, old fellow, I have no
    more time to spare, nor do I feel inclined to write a longer
    letter. When you are back in your studio, be sure to work
    regularly with models; it will give you more satisfaction in
    the long run.</p>

    <p>Well, well - cheerio.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>In case you want to write me again, you can send your
    letters to Etten; they will send them on to me. I am wavering
    between two or three studios, and before January 1<sup>st</sup>
    I shall decide which one to take, but for the moment I have no
    fixed address; you will get it later on.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.father">I left Etten because I had too much botheration with my
    father about all kinds of things that really are not worth
    while talking about - about going to church and such things,
    which, even though I was working hard and much, got me into a
    mood of boredom and chilliness that was all wrong.</label> Therefore I
    have settled down here, and I am glad I am in different
    surroundings. Of course, now I have rather a lot of financial
    worries, but after all it is better than those everlasting
    bickerings and squabbles.</p>

    <p>1. A kind of very strong, twice-fermented, rather
    sour-tasting beer, a specialty of Flanders.</p>
