  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>If I told you some rather gloomy things about her in my last
    letter, it's because I want to state from the beginning that I
    am not living in a garden of roses, but in reality. And because
    I want to protest against sentimental considerations in
    advance, for instance, like those Father and Mother would not
    fail to bring into it, if I asked their advice or merely told
    them the story.</p>

    <p>Sentiment and sentimentality are two very different things
    which they cannot distinguish between. And if I spoke of it,
    Father would perhaps think he had to play the part of a
    gendarme, which would be quite out of place and of little use.
    So you must excuse me if I don't say a word about it to Father
    and Mother, and don't want them to interfere. If Father refused
    to give his consent, there are terms in the law which, as I am
    of age, guarantee my independence; but I don't think Father
    will go so far as to oppose me.</p>

    <p>They will say, &ldquo;You are marrying beneath yourself, and
    you are too poor.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>My answer to this is, If I intended to live in style, the
    result would be very bad. But as I intend to live in a house
    consisting of a studio, one room, and a little kitchen, with a
    bedroom in the attic, and as my way of living will be very
    simple, it can be done; and two persons living together can
    live more cheaply than one.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;On est s&ucirc;r de p&eacute;rir &agrave; part, on ne
    se sauve qu'ensemble&rdquo; [You are sure to perish alone, only
    together you can save yourself].</p>

    <p>I asked Kee if she would risk marrying me. You know how I
    was refused, but the way I was received in Amsterdam was much
    worse than I let on. They told me I wanted to coerce her; she
    refused to see me, to speak to me - not during <i>one</i>
    visit, but during the three days of my stay. Theo, only those
    who misunderstand me completely would tell me, &ldquo;You are
    trying to coerce her.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>What I am doing now proves sufficiently that I didn't want
    to coerce Kee then.</p>

    <p>This woman whom I am with now understands me better. In a
    short time she became as meek as a tame dove, certainly not
    from my coercing her, but because she saw that I was not rough.
    Well, this one has understood, and she said to me, &ldquo;I
    know that you haven't much money, but even if you had less, I
    would put up with everything if only you stay with me and let
    me stay with you; I am so attached to you that I could not be
    alone again.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If someone says that to me, and shows by everything - in
    deeds more than in words - that she means it, then no wonder
    that with her I drop the mask of reserve, almost of roughness,
    which I have worn so long because I did not want to
    flatter.</p>

    <p>And has this woman been the worse for it, or have I been the
    worse for it, now that things have turned out as they have? i
    am quite astonished to see her become brighter and more
    cheerful every day; she is so changed that she seems quite
    different from the pale, sick woman I met this winter. Yet I
    have not done so much for her, I only told her, Do this or
    that, and you will get well again. She hasn't thrown my advice
    to the winds, and when I realized this, I tried even harder to
    help her.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I can understand her better than anyone else because
    she has a few peculiarities which would have been repulsive to
    many others. First, her speech, which is very ugly and is a
    result of her illness; then her temper, caused by a nervous
    disposition, so that she has fits of anger which would be
    unbearable to most people.</p>

    <p>I understand these things, they don't bother me, and until
    now I have been able to manage them. On her side she
    understands my own temper, and it is sort of a tacit
    understanding between us not to find fault with each other.</p>

    <p>If you know the large drawing in the Graphic by Frank Holl,
    &ldquo;The Deserter,&rdquo; I should say she resembles the
    woman in it.</p>

    <p>Every day she learns how to pose better, and this is worth
    <i>so</i> much to me. She is no trouble, no hindrance, but she
    helps and she works with me. She has no pretensions, wanting
    this or that; when there's nothing but bread and coffee, she
    puts up with it and doesn't complain.</p>

    <p>But, Theo, I am pining to see you and speak to you. I am
    also longing for a letter. If I knew that you would not turn
    your back on me for this reason, I should be as happy as a man
    can be. It is true that at first I shall need some help. If I
    should have to do without it, it would be very bad indeed for
    me, and also for her; but that help need not be more than I
    received when alone. And my energy increases, and although I
    have been trying hard to get ahead, of course I am trying even
    harder now; if I may count on your help and sympathy a little
    longer, I will succeed in earning what's necessary through the
    sale of my work. The first step I should like to take is to
    rent the house next door, about which I wrote you. As soon as
    she comes back from Leyden, I will marry her - without telling
    anyone, quietly and without any fuss; then we should be glad to
    have that house. We are prepared to live as simply as
    possible.</p>

    <p>And if you could come and see for yourself, you would
    realize that you can count on both her and me working as hard
    as we can.</p>

    <p>I wish her confinement were over - a heavy ordeal is still
    ahead of her. But so far everything has gone well since the
    visit to Leyden. But neither she nor I is living in a rose
    garden or dreaming in the moonlight; we have a hard time ahead
    of us, so much the better.</p>

    <p>I certainly hope you won't take this in a melancholy way. Of
    course if Kee had only responded a little to my feelings, this
    wouldn't have happened. But during my visit to Amsterdam I had
    such a definite refusal that there wasn't the slightest chance
    of winning her unless my financial circumstances changed
    totally in a short time. This will not happen now, for though I
    shall eventually earn so much that this woman can live on it
    with me, it will not be enough to keep up a social standing;
    besides, I don't have the slightest inclination or longing for
    it. You know what I want: just enough to live on, but I don't
    care for more than that. What I should like best would be to
    have fixed weekly wages, like any labourer, for which I should
    work with all my strength and energy.</p>

    <p>Being a labourer, I feel at home in the labouring class, and
    more and more I will try to live and take root there.</p>

    <p>I cannot do otherwise, I do not want to do otherwise, I
    cannot understand any other way. Adieu, a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
