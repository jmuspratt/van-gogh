    <p>Sunday afternoon</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just received a nice letter from home which gave me
    very real pleasure, and from which it is clear that your visit
    and the things you told them about me and my work have had a
    reassuring effect on them. This is bound, I think, to have
    welcome repercussions, and I should like to thank you in
    particular for the way in which you spoke about me, although it
    seems to me that you had more good things to say than I as yet
    deserve.</p>

    <p>At home they seem very much pleased with their new
    surroundings, and are still full of your visit.</p>

    <p>For that matter, so am I, for several things you told me
    make me think of you more often than before, and certainly not
    with less affection. Especially what you told me about your
    health makes me think of you often. <label content="health.general">I am pretty well; my not
    sparing myself and acting as if I had never been ill works all
    right. But you realize that I have not entirely recovered. I
    feel it at times, especially in the evening when I'm tired; but
    fortunately it never got bad enough to prevent my working.</label></p>

    <p>This week I have painted some rather large studies in the
    wood, which I tried to carry out more thoroughly and vigorously
    than the first ones.</p>

    <p>The one which I believe succeeded best is of nothing but a
    piece of dug-up earth - white, black and brown sand after a
    pouring rain. Here and there the lumps of earth caught the
    light, and stood out in strong relief. After I had been sitting
    drawing that piece of ground for some time, there was another
    violent thunderstorm with a terrific cloudburst, which lasted
    for at least an hour. I was so eager to continue that I
    remained at my post and sheltered myself as well as I could
    behind a big tree. When it was over at last, and the crows
    flying again, I was not sorry I had waited, because of the
    beautiful deep tone which the rain had given to the soil. As I
    had begun before the rain, with a low horizon, on my knees, I
    now had to work kneeling in the mud, and it is because of such
    adventures, which often present themselves in different forms,
    that I think it is not superfluous to wear an ordinary
    workman's suit, which is less easily spoiled. The result of
    this was that I could bring that piece of ground home to the
    studio - though Mauve once rightly said, while speaking about a
    study of his, It is a hard job to draw those lumps of earth and
    get perspective into them.[Painting lost]</p>

    <p><art id=008>The other study in the wood is of some large green beech
    trunks on a stretch of ground covered with dry sticks, and the
    little figure of a girl in white</art>. There was the
    great difficulty of keeping it clear, and of getting space
    between the trunks standing at different distances - and the
    place and relative bulk of those trunks change with the
    perspective - to make it so that one can breathe and walk
    around in it, and to make you smell the fragrance of the
    wood.</p>

    <p>It was with extreme pleasure that I made these two
    studies.</p>

    <p>The same with a thing I saw at Scheveningen, <art id=007>a stretch in
    the dunes in the morning after the rain.</art> The grass was
    comparatively green, and the black nets were spread over it in
    enormous circles, giving the soil deep reddish-black and
    greenish-grey tones. On this somber ground, women in white caps
    and men spreading or repairing the nets were sitting or
    standing, or walking around like dark fantastic ghosts. In
    nature it was as strikingly gloomy and serious as the most
    beautiful Millet, Isra&euml;ls or De Groux one can imagine -
    over the landscape a simple grey sky with a light streak on the
    horizon. Notwithstanding showers of rain, I made a study of it
    on a sheet of oiled Torchon. Much will have to
    happen before I shall be able to make it as vigorous as I
    should like, but these are the things in nature that strike me
    most.</p>

    <p>How beautiful it is outside when everything is wet from the
    rain - before - in - and after the rain. I oughtn't to let a
    single shower pass.</p>

    <p>This morning I have put all the painted studies up in the
    studio. I wish I could talk them over with you.</p>

    <p>As I had already expected and counted on, while I was busy,
    I had to buy a great many things, and the money is nearly all
    spent on them.</p>

    <p>For two weeks I have painted from early in the morning until
    late at night, so to speak; if I continued this way, it would
    be too expensive as long as I do not sell.</p>

    <p>I think it possible that if you saw the paintings, you would
    say that I ought to go on with it, not just at times when I
    feel particularly inclined, but regularly, as absolutely the
    most important thing, though it might cause more expenses. But
    though I myself love doing it, and for the present shall
    probably not paint as much as my ambition and desire demand
    because of the heavy expenses, I think I shall not lose by
    giving a great deal of my time to drawing, and I do this with
    no less pleasure. However, I am in doubt - painting comes
    easier to me than I expected - perhaps it would be better to
    throw myself into it with all my strength, first pegging away
    with the brush. I must say I cannot tell.</p>

    <p>At all events, drawing in charcoal is something I am sure I
    must study now more than ever - at all events, I have enough to
    do and can go on. Even when I restrain myself a little in
    painting, I can work just as hard.</p>

    <p>If I have now painted so many studies in a short time, it is
    because I work hard, literally working all day, scarcely taking
    time even to eat or drink.</p>

    <p>There are little figures in several of the studies. I also
    worked on a large one and have scraped it off twice, which you
    would perhaps have thought too rash if you had seen the effect;
    but it was not impatience, it was because I feel I can do even
    better by grinding and trying, and I absolutely want to succeed
    in doing better, however much time, however much trouble it may
    cost.</p>

    <p>Landscape, as I have taken it up now, decidedly requires the
    figure too. They are studies for backgrounds which one must do
    so thoroughly because the tone of the figure and the effect of
    the whole depend on it.</p>

    <p>What I like so much about painting is that with the same
    amount of trouble which one takes over a drawing, one brings
    home something that conveys the impression much better and is
    much more pleasant to look at - and at the same time, more
    correct too. In a word it is more gratifying than drawing. But
    it is absolutely necessary to be able to draw the right
    proportion and the position of the object pretty correctly
    before one begins. If one makes mistakes in this, the whole
    thing comes to nothing.</p>

    <p>I am longing for autumn. I must be sure to have a stock of
    colours and other things against that time. I love so much, so
    very much, the effect of the yellow leaves; the green beech
    trunks stand out so well against them, and figures, too.</p>

    <p>Lately I read part of a rather melancholy book, Letters and
    Diary of Gerard Bilders. [A Dutch painter who died young.] He
    died at the age when I began. When I read that, I was not sorry
    that I started late. He certainly was unhappy and was often
    misunderstood, but at the same time I find a great weakness in
    him, something morbid in his character. It is like the story of
    a plant which shoots up too soon, and cannot stand the frost,
    and gets stricken to the roots by it on a certain night and
    then withers. At first everything goes all right - he is with a
    teacher (as in a hothouse) - he makes quick progress but in
    Amsterdam he is almost alone, and with all his cleverness, he
    cannot stand it there, and comes back home to his father quite
    discouraged, dissatisfied, listless - he paints a little there,
    and then dies of consumption or of some other disease in his
    twenty-eighth year.</p>

    <p>What I don't like about him is that <i>while he
    paints</i>, he complains of terrible dullness and
    idleness, as though it were something he couldn't do anything
    about; and he continues to run around with a, to him, too
    oppressive circle of friends, and persisting in the amusements
    and way of life which bore him to death. In short, he is a
    sympathetic figure; but I would rather read the life of father
    Millet or of Th. Rousseau or of Daubigny. Reading Sensier's
    book on Millet gives one courage, and Bilders's makes one feel
    terrible.</p>

    <p>I often find an enumeration of difficulties in Millet's
    letters, but still, j'ai tout de me me fait ceci ou cela [I
    have done this or that after all], and then he always has other
    things in mind which he absolutely must do and which he will
    carry out.</p>

    <p>And too often G. Bilders says, &ldquo;I've been blue this
    week and have been making a mess of things - I went to this or
    that concert or theater, but came home even more miserable than
    when I went.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>What strikes me in Millet is this simple, &ldquo;l must do
    this or that <i>after all</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Bilders is very witty, and can lament in a most ludicrous
    way about &ldquo;Manila cigars&rdquo; - which he likes and
    which he cannot afford - about tailors' bills which he cannot
    figure out how to pay. He describes his anxiety about money
    affairs so wittily that he himself and the reader have to
    laugh. But no matter how wittily these things may be told, I
    dislike it, and have more respect for Millet's private
    difficulties, &ldquo;il faut tout de m&ecirc;me de la soupe
    pour les enfants&rdquo; [after all, there must be soup for the
    children]; he does not talk about &ldquo;Manila cigars&rdquo;
    or about amusements.</p>

    <p>What I want to say is, Gerard Bilders's view of life was
    romantic, and he never got over the illusions perdues; for my
    part I think it a certain advantage that I started only when I
    had left romantic illusions behind me. I must make up for lost
    time now. I must work hard, but just when one has left the lost
    illusions behind, work becomes a necessity and one of the few
    pleasures left. And this gives a great quiet and
    tranquillity.</p>

    <p>I regret that it will be a year perhaps before you will see
    all my paintings (even though I might send you something now
    and then) and before we can talk things over. I assure you that
    the things I have painted now will prove useful to me. Perhaps
    I shall succeed now where I did not succeed in January. The
    reason I enjoy painting so much is not its agreeable aspect,
    but its throwing light on various questions of tone and form
    and material. I used to be helpless before them, but now by
    means of painting I can attempt them. Now I also see a better
    chance of getting results with charcoal.</p>

    <p>Please do not suspect me of being indifferent to earning
    money; I am trying to find the shortest way to that end. If
    only those means of earning money be real and lasting, which I
    personally can only see in the future if there is some real
    good in my work, not if I aim exclusively at saleability - one
    has to suffer for that later - but if I study nature
    carefully.</p>

    <p>If you saw that my painting would have the best chance, of
    course I should not refuse to paint more. But if it would be a
    long time before it became saleable, I would be the first to
    say, Meanwhile we must practice the greatest economy, and, by
    drawing, many expenses are avoided and one makes solid though
    slow progress. I see a change in these painted things, and I am
    writing you about it because you can tell better than I how it
    may affect the eventual saleability. At all events it seems to
    me that the painted studies have a <i>more pleasant aspect</i>
    than my drawings.</p>

    <p>Personally, I attach less value to the more pleasant, less
    meager effect; my goal is the expression of more severe and
    virile things, for which I still have to drudge a great
    deal.</p>

    <p>But if you said, Work on those landscapes or woods scenes or
    marines, I would have nothing against it, as it would not
    prevent my attempting larger or more serious things. I should
    only want the assurance that they are worth the brushes, the
    paint and the canvas, and that it is not throwing money away to
    do them, but that they are worth what they cost. In that case I
    should even work on them with great ambition. I will begin by
    letting them ripen a little more, by putting some more vigour
    into them. Then in a few months, for instance, I will send you
    something again, and we can see.</p>

    <p>I believe most painters have eventually succeeded in
    reaching a higher level this way. I should not want to make
    things that were intrinsically bad, untrue, and of false
    conception, because I love nature too much. But this is the
    problem: I must still make many studies to reach something
    higher and better. What will be most profitable, drawing those
    studies or painting them?</p>

    <p>If the painted ones are unsaleable, then certainly it will
    be more advantageous to draw with charcoal or something. But if
    it were possible to make good the expense of painted studies,
    then I want to tell you that in principle I have nothing
    against it, now that I see that they turn out rather well and
    may perhaps turn out to be a source of good fortune. In
    principle I am only against wasting paint on things which one
    can learn just as well another way, when there is no chance of
    selling them at present.</p>

    <p>I should not want to cause either myself or you unnecessary
    expense, but I see clearly that the painted things have a more
    pleasant aspect. This makes me uncertain what to do. My money
    is not quite gone, but there is not much left. If I am not
    mistaken, today is the twentieth; I have spent less rather than
    more than usual on the household this month. It is true I have
    had to spend a good deal on painting materials, but much of
    this will last quite a while. But it is true that everything is
    very expensive. I hope you will be able to send something soon.
    Receive a warm handshake in thought and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I certainly hope that you will not infer from this letter
    that I am pretentious enough to think these first studies
    saleable. Formerly I could tell better than now what things
    were worth, whether they were saleable or not; now I notice
    daily that I do not know any more, and studying nature is more
    important to me than studying the prices of pictures. But I
    think I see that the painted studies have a much more pleasing
    aspect than either those drawn in black and white or the
    watercolours you saw recently. And therefore I am uncertain as
    to whether it might possibly be more profitable after all to
    make painting absolutely the principal thing, notwithstanding
    the greater expense. I would rather you decided this than I,
    because I think you are more competent to judge financial
    success, and I absolutely trust your judgment.</p>

    <p>You told me to try to finish a little drawing in
    watercolour. I believe that by painting I shall actually be
    able to make better watercolours than before, if I start them
    again. But if it does not turn out well, you must not get
    discouraged, neither must I, and you must not be afraid to
    criticize me. I do not systematically ignore criticism, but it
    generally takes more time to change a thing than to indicate a
    change. Thus I have only just put into practice things that
    Mauve told me in January. And, for instance, I painted that
    piece of ground according to a conversation I had with him
    about a study of his.</p>
