  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Still quite under the spell of your visit, I write you a
    word or two, not a little pleased that I can go ahead
    vigorously with my painting.</p>

    <p>I should have liked to see you off at the station the next
    morning, but I thought you had already given me so much of your
    time that it would have been indiscreet to ask to see you again
    that morning. I am so thankful that you have been here. I think
    it a delightful prospect to be able to work a whole year
    without anxiety, and a new horizon has been opened to me in
    painting through what you gave me.</p>

    <p>I think I am privileged over thousands of others because you
    removed so many barriers for me.</p>

    <p>Of course many a painter cannot go on because of the
    expenses, and I cannot express to you in words how thankful I
    am to be able to go on working regularly. I began later than
    others, and I must work doubly hard to make up for lost time;
    but in spite of my ardour, I should have to stop if it were not
    for you.</p>

    <p>I will tell you what I have bought.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">First, a large-size moist-colour box containing 12 pieces or
    tubes of watercolours, with a double cover, one of which can be
    used as a palette; there is also room for about six brushes. It
    is an article which is of great value for working in the open
    air, and really absolutely necessary, but it is very expensive;
    and I had always put it off and worked with loose pieces on
    saucers, which, however, are very difficult to take with you,
    especially if one has to carry other things besides. So this is
    a fine thing which, now that I have it, will last a long
    time.</p>

    <p>At the same time I stocked up on watercolours and renewed my
    brushes. Then, for oil painting, I now have everything which is
    absolutely necessary, and also a stock of paints, large tubes
    (which are much cheaper than the little ones); but you will
    understand that I limited myself to the simple colours in
    watercolour as well as in oil: ochre (red - yellow- brown),
    cobalt and Prussian blue, Naples yellow, sienna, black and
    white, completed with some smaller tubes of carmine, sepia,
    vermilion, ultramarine, gamboge.</p>

    <p>But I refrained from choosing &ldquo;nice&rdquo; colours
    which one ought to mix oneself.</label></p>

    <p>I believe this is a practical palette with healthy colours.
    Ultramarine, carmine, or the like are added when strictly
    necessary.</p>

    <p>[<art id=249_V-T_2220>Vincent drew a sketch of his palette with the colours here.</art>]

    <p>I will begin with little things, but this summer I hope to
    practice making large sketches in charcoal, so I can paint them
    later on a somewhat larger scale.</p>

    <p>And therefore I ordered a new and I hope better perspective
    frame, which can be fixed in uneven ground in the dunes by two
    poles, in this way, for instance:</p>

    <p>[<art id=249_V-T_2221>A sketch of him using his perspective frame drawn here.</art>]</p>

    <p>What we saw in Scheveningen together - sand, sea and sky -
    is something I certainly hope to express sometime.</p>

    <p>Of course I didn't spend everything you gave me immediately,
    though I must say that the prices of the different things were
    much higher than I had anticipated, and on second thought,
    there are always more things needed than one at first expected.
    If I ask you kindly to send the usual allowance about the
    twentieth, it is not because I shall have spent all I have, but
    because I think it better to keep something in my pocket, in
    case I should need some more things while working - it
    guarantees my working in a very quick and orderly fashion.</p>

    <p>The moist-colour box fits into my paintbox, so that I can
    carry everything necessary for watercolour and painting in
    <i>one piece</i>.</p>

    <p>I attach great importance to having good stuff to work with,
    and I should like my studio to look well - not with antiques or
    tapestry or rugs, but simply because of the studies on the wall
    and because of good material; but this will come in time
    through hard work. Speaking about the village-policeman-style -
    I myself feel less like a policeman than like a kind of Delft
    bargeman, for instance, and I have no objection to making my
    studio look like a kind of comfortable barge.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">Yesterday afternoon I was in the attic of the wholesale
    paper firm of Smulders on the Laan. There I found - can you
    guess? - the double Ingres, under the name of Torchon paper;
    the grain is even coarser than in yours. I'm enclosing a sample
    to show you. There is a whole stock of it, old and yellowed,
    very good. I took only half a quire now, but I can always get
    more later on. I went there to buy something else, the
    so-called honey paper which I use now and then. Very cheap,
    originally an undelivered Land Registry order. It is very
    suitable for charcoal drawing, and comes in large sheets about
    the same colour as the Harding.</label></p>

    <p>You can see this sample has a grain as rough as a piece of
    canvas, what you brought has a prettier colour and is
    delightful, for studies of banks and ditches or soil, for
    instance. But I am very glad I discovered this new kind,
    too.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, thanks for everything, a handshake in thought.
    I'm back to work again. Give my warmest greetings to Father and
    Mother; thank them for what you brought me from them, and tell
    them I shall write soon, but as we agreed, not about anything
    personal.</p>

    <p>Adieu, I wish you a pleasant time and a good return to your
    work, believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
