    <p>Tuesday afternoon</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Tidings from Sien that she is getting along well. If it
    continues like this, she will leave the hospital a fortnight
    after her confinement. This persuaded me to take the new house,
    so that she may find a warm nest when she returns after so much
    pain. So I made an arrangement with the owner. First, that he
    would help me move at once, namely that he would lend me a few
    men from the yard for an afternoon to carry my furniture over,
    because I myself am not allowed to lift many heavy things,
    indeed none at all. And second, that I shall not pay him any
    rent before I myself or Sien comes to live there definitely,
    for perhaps she will come back from the hospital before me.
    Meanwhile, I must make some arrangement with the old landlord
    about the current month (for as I was ill and did not know when
    I should recover, I could not give him notice). I hope I shall
    get off with paying just one or two weeks' rent; at least I do
    not intend to pay him the full month.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you have sent something already, and then I shall
    find your letter with the hospital porter tomorrow morning. But
    if you haven't sent anything, I ask you kindly to do it soon,
    for I am short of cash and will have to pay 10 guilders in
    advance to enter the hospital again, so that my going back
    depends on receiving your letter. This morning the porter
    didn't yet have a letter for me.</p>

    <p>Now most of the moving is done. Sien's mother is helping me;
    it is quite a job, for the whole house is full of plaster, and
    must be scrubbed. But the studio and the alcove are clean, and
    almost all the furniture has been moved. Just now we are
    sitting down for a bite of lunch.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I am feeling pretty good, at least much better than I have
    for a long time. Yesterday I met the superintendent of the
    hospital, Dr. van Tienhoven, on the street, and told him how I
    was getting on, and he said it was all right.</p>

    <p>So I hope to be quite well soon.</label></p>

    <p>If I had planned this new house myself with fitting it up as
    a studio in mind, I couldn't have done better than the way it
    is now. And no other house on this street is like this inside,
    though the exteriors all look alike. My being in it is really
    the fault of the storm which broke the window of the other
    studio; if it hadn't happened, I shouldn't have known anything
    about this house.</p>

    <p>It was the carpenter who told me about it at the time, and
    said, Why don't you go and live next door?</p>

    <p>Well, brother, in the midst of all the moving, I hammered
    off another drawing, and this time it was a watercolour.[Painting lost] It was
    a sketch which had remained unfinished because of my illness.
    So that now things are coming to life again. It represents
    fishing smacks on the beach, big hulls of boats lying on the
    hot sand, and the sea far away in a blue haze; it was a sunny
    day, but the sun was behind me, so one must feel it only in a
    few short-cast shadows and the vibration of the hot air above
    the sand. It is only an impression, but I think it is rather
    correct [F none, JH 159].</p>

    <p>My fingers are itching to set to work again, and I need not
    tell you that I would rather go to Scheveningen than to the
    hospital. But what must be, must be. Now I am longing very much
    for your letter, and even more for your visit, if only I am not
    in the hospital then.</p>

    <p>I wonder what you will say about the new house and also what
    you will think of Sien when you see her, and about the new
    little baby. I hope with all my heart that you will feel some
    sympathy for Sien, as she deserves it.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">Another thing&hellip;do you think you could get some more of
    that Ingres paper as thick as the enclosed sample, but with a
    little more tone? </label>If so, bring it along when you come, together
    with those of my sketches which you do not care to keep. Of
    course I hope that you will keep &ldquo;Sorrow&rdquo; and the
    best ones, especially <art id=929a>the large &ldquo;Sorrow,&rdquo;</art> for
    yourself.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
