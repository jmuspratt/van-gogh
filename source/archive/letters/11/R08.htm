  <body>
    <p>138 Schenkweg, The Hague</p>

    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Thanks <sup>1</sup>. I have just now put my drawings into
    the package for Amsterdam. There are seven in all. The big one
    of the two &ldquo;charity courts&rdquo; has become quite flat,
    because I used Bristol board, and the lines have greatly gained
    in quickness. Then there is the &ldquo;Florist's Garden&rdquo;;
    this I changed the way you suggested, i.e. I studied the side
    of the ditch more carefully, as well as the water in the
    foreground, and only now it shows to it's full advantage, I
    think, and expresses &ldquo;Spring&rdquo; and a gentle
    silence.</p>

    <p>And then the &ldquo;Carpenter's Shed&rdquo; [F 939, JH 150]
    - taken from the window of my studio - by working on it with
    pen and ink I have brought a new kind of black into it, and now
    &ldquo;the sun is shining,&rdquo; because the lights show up
    more strongly. Today I was at it quite early, for I wanted to
    make another one like it, and went to the dunes to draw a
    fish-drying barn, also seen from a height like the carpenter's
    shed [F 938, JH 152], and now it is nearly one o'clock in the
    night, but, thank God, everything is finished, and I can look
    my redoubtable landlord in the face without fear. And so
    &ldquo;&ccedil;a ira encore&rdquo; - -</p>

    <p>I am so glad to have seen you again, and what you told me of
    your work interested me very much indeed, I assure you. I
    should so much like to take a few walks with you in this
    neighbourhood some time. For undoubtedly you would find a lot
    of subject matter in those fish-drying barns at Scheveningen
    for instance. They are enormously Ruysdael-like (I mean that
    picture of the bleaching fields at Overveen). But perhaps you
    know The Hague and Scheveningen better than I do. But in case
    you do not know the &ldquo;Geest,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Mud's
    End,&rdquo; etc., that is to say the Whitechapel of The Hague
    with all its alleys and courts, I offer to accompany you there,
    whenever you come to The Hague again.</p>

    <p>I have found two more wood engravings for you, one by Mrs.
    Edwards and the other by Green. The latter one is especially
    beautiful, an artist painting a signboard with people looking
    on; time: Louis XVI. And I think I also have an extra copy of a
    fine Rochussen.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that, if you wanted to, you could have a much
    finer collection than I have, but perhaps you have it already.
    I have never seen your complete collection, only the small
    D&uuml;rers and Holbeins and Du Mauriers and some others. If
    you should find something interesting in this line, please let
    me know.</p>

    <p>Do you know &ldquo;The Wayfarers&rdquo; by Fred Walker? It
    is a large etching of a blind old man led by a boy along a
    frozen gravel road, with the ditch along witch there is
    copse-wood covered with glazed frost, on a winter evening. It
    certainly is one of the most sublime creations in this style,
    with a very peculiar, modern sentiment, perhaps less powerful
    than D&uuml;rer in his &ldquo;Knight, Death and Devil,&rdquo;
    but perhaps even more intimate, and certainly as original and
    sincere.</p>

    <p>It is a pity that the artists here know so little of their
    English colleagues. Mauve, for instance, was quite thrilled
    when he saw Millais' landscape &ldquo;Chill October,&rdquo; but
    for all that they don't believe in English art, and they look
    upon it in too superficial a manner, I think. Over and over
    again Mauve says, &ldquo;This is literary art,&rdquo; but all
    the while he forgets that English writers like Dickens and
    Eliot and Currer Bell, and of the French, for instance, Balzac,
    are so astonishingly &ldquo;<i>plastic</i>,&rdquo; if I may use
    the expression, that their work is just as powerful as, for
    instance, a drawing by Herkomer or Fildes or Isra&euml;ls.</p>

    <p>Speaking for myself, I hate skepticism just as much as
    sentimentality; I do not want to suggest that the artists here
    are skeptics or cynics, but sometimes they seem to be, and take
    on a certain air of it, whereas confronted with nature they are
    as serious and devout as can be. However, I often catch myself
    making the same mistake, after which I lapse into
    sentimentality on the rebound, more than I ever intend to, so
    that I have hardly a right to criticize them.</p>

    <p>How much that is beautiful - in the sense of picturesque -
    is disappearing these days! The other day I read something by
    the son of Charles Dickens; he said, &ldquo;If my father were
    to come back, he would find little of the London he described,
    the 'old' London is disappearing - is being 'sanified.'&rdquo;
    And in our country it is just the same - those nice little
    courts - they are being replaced by rows of houses, in the
    highest degree <i>un</i>picturesque, unless they are still
    being built, for then they are, what with the sheds and
    scaffolding and workmen, very pleasant to look at. For
    instance, there is a quarter behind Bazar Street and Laan
    [Avenue] van Meerdervoort where I have seen beautiful things:
    building plots being dug up or levelled, sheds, wooden huts,
    hoardings, etc., etc., whatever you like.</p>

    <p>Rather interesting too are the public soup kitchens and
    under all circumstances the third-class waiting rooms. If I did
    not have to make city views for a living, I would do nothing
    but figure drawings these days, but I have not found anybody
    who would buy them, and regularly I have to pay for models,
    though now and then I can get people to pose for nothing.</p>

    <p>I am very much pleased with the model I have; I mean that
    woman who was in my studio when you were here, for she is
    learning more every day, and understands me. For instance, when
    something goes wrong and I fly into a rage and get up and say,
    &ldquo;Damn it, it's all wrong!&rdquo; or something even worse
    than that, she does not take it as a personal affront, as of
    course most others would, but lets me calm down and start all
    over again. And she undergoes the tedious work of finding the
    right light and the right pose patiently. So I think her a
    honey. If I want to ascertain the height of a figure
    out-of-doors or to fix the right position of a little figure on
    a drawing I am working on in the open air, as, for instance,
    the way a figure stands out against the background of a fishing
    boat on the beach, and where the light touches it, I have only
    to say, &ldquo;Be there at such and such a time,&rdquo; and she
    is there.</p>

    <p>Oh, there is gossip enough, because I am always in her
    company, but why should that bother me? - I never had such a
    good assistant as this ugly (???), faded woman. In my eyes she
    is beautiful, and I find in her exactly what I want; her life
    has been rough, and sorrow and adversity have put their marks
    upon her - now I can do something with her.</p>

    <p>When the earth is not ploughed, you can get no harvest from
    it. She has been ploughed - and so I find more in her than in a
    crowd of unploughed ones.</p>

    <p>I hope you will write me soon again, and if you agree, I
    should like to correspond regularly, as far as our respective
    tasks permit, provided we warn each other as soon as our
    &ldquo;practical talk&rdquo; lapses into unpracticality, and
    without getting angry at such a warning, as was the case with
    Mr. Tersteeg, as I told you.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow I hope to go into the dunes, to the same
    fish-drying barns. The other day I read that big book about
    Millet, written by his friend Sensier; it is very interesting,
    and if you have not read it, I strongly recommend it. There is
    much in it that only Sensier could know, because he was
    Millet's intimate friend; one finds absolutely new things in
    it, at least it was this way with me, though I have read quite
    a number of things about Millet.</p>

    <p>Well, goodbye, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

        <p>See letter 202 to Theo. &ldquo;I have received 2.50
        guilders from him (Rappard), because he saw a tear in one
        of the drawings and said, You must have that
