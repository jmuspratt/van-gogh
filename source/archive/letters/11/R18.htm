  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I had just gone out to the printer's when I met the postman,
    who gave me your letter. My heartfelt thanks for your proposal,
    which I shall write about in a minute. First I want to tell you
    that I am working on my fourth stone, and am sending you
    herewith the impressions of the three you don't have. I shall
    have to retouch two of them, namely the &ldquo;Digger&rdquo; [F
    1656, JH 262] and the &ldquo;Coffee Drinker.&rdquo;
    <sup>1</sup> The latter was much more striking as a drawing; <label content="art.technique">in
    the lithograph I have used autographic ink, which did not
    transfer very well, and the &ldquo;quickness&rdquo; of the
    drawing has to a great extent gone out of it. There was also
    more animation in the black parts, as the hatching expressed
    the direction and form of the folds much more strongly. Well,
    the same is true of the &ldquo;Digger,&rdquo; but this sheet
    has in general acquired a certain vigour and ruggedness which
    corresponds with the character of the figure, though I should
    have liked a greater diversity of tone. I am now trying to find
    a way to combine the new method (transferring the drawing on
    paper) with the old (working directly on the stone).</label></p>

    <p>You may remember the drawing &ldquo;Worn out&rdquo; [F 864,
    JH 051]; I did it all over again the other day - actually three
    separate times, with two models - and I am going to toil on it
    a lot more. For the present I have <i>one</i> which will be the
    subject of the fifth stone; it shows an old workman sitting
    lost in thought, his elbows on his knees, and his hands
    clasping his head (this time with a bald crown).<sup>2</sup> [F
    997, JH 267; F 1662, JH 268; F 998, JH 269]. I'm telling you
    all this about the lithographs in order to show you that I'm
    very keen on it, and consequently that your proposal about the
    money that was lost is most welcome.</p>

    <p>The letter has not been found yet, and it contained a
    50-franc note. But let's wait a bit for the present; the matter
    is being investigated. I told the man at the printer's of this
    catastrophe, and so far he has been sufficiently well disposed
    toward me not to press me for payment of the cost of the
    stones. For that matter, the stones are in his possession, so
    he isn't running any risk, or hardly any.</p>

    <p>So about your offer - in case of need I shall gladly accept;
    it means a backing for me, and I can now venture to take a few
    more steps, but perhaps it will not be necessary, because the
    letter may still turn up. But it is most certainly an
    incitement to redouble my efforts, and to prove to you that I
    am working away at it rather strenuously. I drew the Digger in
    twelve different poses, and I am still trying to find something
    better. He is a marvellously fine model, a true veteran
    digger.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday Van der Weele, the painter who teaches drawing
    at the secondary school here, came to see me; he saw the
    various drawings of the <i>orphan</i>-men and urgently advised
    me to make a large composition of them - which I think
    premature, however. I want to make still more studies; the
    &ldquo;Coffee Drinker&rdquo; is one of them.</p>

    <p>Enclosed is a wood engraving after Frank Hol. That reminds
    me of the lot of magazines you have bought. I congratulate you
    on getting them; `70 - `72 is exactly - at least primarily -
    the great period of the English artists. At the time Black and
    White was flourishing and in its full vigour. I think there
    must be splendid things among them.</p>

    <p>I'll tell you why it means so much to me to push on with the
    lithographs so vigorously. If I can manage to get a number of
    good stones together (there is sure to be a failure once in a
    while), I will be able to apply for work - for instance, in
    England too. It stands to reason that one has a better chance
    to succeed if one can show some work at the same time - for
    instance, by sending copies of lithographs - than if one tries
    to get results with words alone.</p>

    <p>Sending drawings is inadvisable, as they can easily be lost.
    This new process enables me to work for a lithographic printing
    office at a distance without having to send the stones
    themselves. I bought a new kind of ink and a new kind of crayon
    [Kopal crayon], today. My present address is 136<b>,</b>
    Schenkweg. I shall be glad to have your opinion of the copies
    I'm sending you. If it is possible for me to correct any
    faults, I shall be glad to do so. Yet one must be careful once
    it is drawn, for then one no longer has full control. I think
    you'll rather like the new &ldquo;Worn Out&rdquo; - tomorrow I
    hope to attack the lithograph of it.</p>

    <p>Well, my page is full now - although I have written only
    about professional matters, don't think that I'm not concerned
    about your illness. On the contrary, I worry all the more when
    I remember how I caught cold too last summer, and had a rather
    high fever, and - and - however, I hope with all my heart that
    it isn't the same with you. However this may be, I most
    sincerely wish you a speedy recovery, and believe me, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
