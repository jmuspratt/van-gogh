  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>My heartfelt thanks for your money order, no less for your
    letter <sup>1</sup>. The reason for my disappointment over the
    money I expected, about which I wrote, has now been
    established. A letter containing money (especially intended to
    pay for lithographs) got lost, and there is little hope of its
    turning up again, though the matter is being investigated. But
    I would rather have it this way than to find that they were not
    appreciated at all, as was the case last summer with my
    drawings. It is very annoying not to be able to press on with
    my work as vigorously as I could have if the money had not been
    lost, but things will be straightened out eventually, and in
    the meantime I am trying to continue working anyway.</p>

    <p>I have little time to write, but all the same I want to tell
    you that I think your remarks on the faulty drawing in the
    lithograph in question are correct in principle - and that I
    now notice it myself.</p>

    <p>I should like to write at greater length about your
    statement, &ldquo;One should only put something before the
    world if that something fulfills the strictest demands of
    technique.&rdquo; That is what the art dealers say too, and
    <i>I do not believe what they say. Think it over a little</i>
    <sup>2</sup> - that would save me the trouble of writing about
    it - and ask yourself whether it is not just as permissible to
    put a drawing like this one, just as is drawn from the model
    without any subsequent retouching, before the world (although I
    admit that there is some faulty drawing in it), as it is for me
    to go out into the street in my work clothes if I think it
    convenient, and without having to plant myself before a mirror
    to see if there's something the matter with my attire before I
    leave the house. If you admit that these things are similar,
    though you yourself would do neither, then the question remains
    whether it is not often more advisable during a campaign to
    march quickly than to smarten oneself up.</p>

    <p>Further, I <i>cannot</i> agree with what you say about the
    way the public looks at things, namely being struck by faulty
    drawing before seeing the character. I do believe, however,
    that a relatively small part of the public looks at pictures in
    exactly the way you describe, but not the big crowd to whom
    Herkomer says, &ldquo;<i>For you, the public, it is really
    done</i>&rdquo; <sup>3</sup> - at least that's what I
    think.</p>

    <p>So much for that - if I can find time and words for it, I
    shall try to make my meaning clearer to you someday.</p>

    <p>As I happen to be writing about matters on which I am not
    entirely in agreement with you (your remarks about my faulty
    drawing do not belong to them; I found every one of them
    correct), I want to speak to you about your &ldquo;big
    decoration&rdquo; and &ldquo;menu,&rdquo; and I will say only
    this, Old fellow, you'd better do something else; it's
    dangerous navigation. You know where you begin, but you don't
    know whether you'll have the power to stop. Once you have got
    the reputation of being able to do something for &ldquo;festive
    occasions,&rdquo; there will never be a &ldquo;festive
    occasion&rdquo; without your being the victim. Look it up in De
    Oude Heer Smits,<sup>4</sup> who wrote a very witty and
    practical little essay about this which will explain it to you
    more clearly than I can. This is the time for campaigning; at
    least a time when a campaign can be undertaken.</p>

    <p>I am not speaking about the nude in itself, but of the
    &ldquo;big decoration.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I know Boughton's &ldquo;The Heir&rdquo; as a painting; I
    saw it at the Royal Academy and later at Goupil's. At the time
    I admired it so much that I made a little sketch of it for an
    acquaintance in Holland, to give him an idea of it. I do not
    know the wood engraving.</p>

    <p>I cannot get Renouard's &ldquo;The Miners&rdquo; here. I
    have gone to all kinds of places to get the last issues of
    L'Illustration; and they either did not have any or had issues
    in which these prints do not occur.</p>

    <p>On condition that you will let me pay for it - not otherwise
    - I should like to ask you to look up the issues and to order
    them for me, at least if you intend to order them for
    yourself.</p>

    <p>If they should not be able to do it in Utrecht, I can order
    them here, <i>but only if I know the numbers in which they
    occur and the dates.</i> One must always hurry when ordering
    separate issues, as the orders are often ignored, or that
    particular issue sold out. Thus, because time is of the
    essence, it might be more practical if you ordered them in
    Utrecht.</p>

    <p>I once got Renouard's &ldquo;Enfants assist&eacute;s&rdquo;
    in this way.</p>

    <p>Yes - and now you must not take it amiss if I state my
    meaning somewhat more forcibly: the more you make menus and
    decorations for festive occasions - however nice or well done
    they may be - the less you will remain at peace with your
    conscience as an artist. And the more you devote yourself to
    serious toiling and moiling, such as the &ldquo;Asylum for the
    Blind,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Tile Painters,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Girl
    Knitting&rdquo; the more you will feel that though this toiling
    and moiling may not score an immediate success, it has its
    raison d'&ecirc;tre.</p>

    <p>The Society Kunstliefde [Love of Art] is more in need of
    your serious work than of a decoration, however well it might
    turn out.</p>

    <p>Now it seems to me that I have a daalder [1.50 guilders] of
    yours in my possession with which to buy wood engravings, or
    something like that, as the opportunity occurs, and on this
    condition I won't return the surplus of your money order, which
    is at the moment doubly welcome, for it will be a tremendous
    disappointment if the letter is not found. Once again, many
    thanks for the early remittance, and be assured that if I say
    something about that decoration or other things in which my
    opinion differs from yours, I speak that frankly just because I
    appreciate your intentions and your work and consider them
    important.</p>

    <p>However harsh it may sound, I really believe that you will
    have the greatest and best influence, e.g. in the Society
    Kunstliefde, if you decline all posts of honour and do not
    occupy yourself with being of &ldquo;service&rdquo; on festive
    occasions - from which I do not expect any good anyway, either
    for the artists or for the public, and which I do not consider
    proofs of prosperity of the societies which celebrate them.</p>

    <p>Adieu, believe me, with a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
