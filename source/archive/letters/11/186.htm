  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today I have mailed you a drawing which I send to show my
    gratitude for all you have done for me during what would
    otherwise have been a hard winter. Last summer when you showed
    me Millet's large woodcut &ldquo;The Shepherdess,&rdquo; I
    thought, How much can be done with one single line. Of course I
    don't pretend to be able to express as much as Millet in a
    single contour. But I tried to put some sentiment into this
    figure. I only hope this drawing will please you.</p>

    <p>And at the same time you can see that I am hard at work. Now
    that I have started, I should like to make about thirty studies
    from the nude.</p>

    <p>In my opinion the enclosed is the best figure I have drawn
    yet, therefore I thought I should send it to you. It is not the
    study from the model, and yet it is <art id=929a>directly after the model</art>.
    <label content="art.technique">You should know that I had two underlayers
    beneath my paper. I had been working hard to get the right
    contour; when I took the drawing from the board, it had been
    imprinted quite correctly on the two underlayers, and I
    finished them immediately according to the <art id=929>first study</art>.
    </label> So this one is even fresher than the first. I am
    keeping the other two for myself, I wouldn't like to part with
    them.</p>

    <p>You will see from this that it is not without reason that I
    wrote you, I would rather not return the money to Tersteeg now;
    I need it so much myself, and I think that working hard with a
    model is the fastest way to succeed. It is true the model I
    have is not so very expensive, but as the expense recurs almost
    daily, it is often hard enough for me to pay. Well, arrange it
    the way you think best; but if it's convenient, send what you
    promised not too late in the month. Adieu, a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I think this drawing would look well on a simple grey mount.
    Of course I don't always draw this way, but I'm very fond of
    the English drawings done in this style, so no wonder I tried
    it for once; and as it was for you, and you understand these
    things, I didn't hesitate to be rather melancholy. I wanted to
    say something like</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Mais reste le vide du coeur,</p>

    <p>Que rien ne remplira&rdquo;</p>

    <p>[But there remains the void in the heart</p>

    <p>That nothing will fill],</p>

    <p>As in Michelet's book.</p>
