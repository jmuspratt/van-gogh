  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today, Saturday, I am sending you those two drawings,
    <art id=940>&ldquo;Fish Drying Barn&rdquo;</art> in the dunes at
    Scheveningen, and <art id=939>&ldquo;Carpenter's Workshop and a
    Laundry&rdquo; (seen from my studio window)</art>.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">I have been thinking of you very often lately, and also of
    that time long ago when, as you remember, you visited me once
    at The Hague, and we walked together along the Rijswijk road
    and drank milk at that mill [see Letter 10].</label> It may be this has
    influenced me somehow when doing these drawings; I have tried
    to draw the things as naively as possible, exactly as I saw
    them before me. Looking back on those days of the mill, how
    sympathetic that time always seems to me; however, it would
    have been impossible for me to put what I saw and felt on
    paper. So I say that the changes time brings do not alter my
    basic feelings; I think they are just developed in another
    form. My life, and perhaps after all yours, too, is not as
    sunny now as it was then; but I would not go back, because
    through that very trouble and adversity I have seen some good
    arise, namely the ability to express that feeling.</p>

    <p>Rappard was greatly pleased with a drawing similar to one
    which C. M. has, and also with all the others I drew for C. M.,
    especially the large one of the little yard. And he is a man
    who understands my intentions, and who appreciates all the
    difficulties. I think you would find Rappard greatly changed
    since his first visit to Paris, when you knew him.</p>

    <p>In front of me is a book, an illustrated Household edition
    of Dickens. Those illustrations are splendid, they are drawn by
    Barnard and Fildes.</p>

    <p>There are some parts of old London in it which, on account
    of the peculiar wood engraving, have quite a different aspect
    from, for instance, the &ldquo;Carpenter's Shop.&rdquo; But I
    believe that the way to acquire that strength and power is
    quietly to continue observing faithfully. As you see, there are
    already several planes in this drawing, and one can look around
    it and through it, in every nook and cranny. It still lacks
    vigour - at least it is far from having as much of that quality
    as those illustrations, but it will come by and by.</p>

    <p><label content="business.sales">I have had news from C. M. in the form of a postal order for
    20 guilders but without one written word. So I do not know as
    yet whether he will give me a new order, or whether the
    drawings are to his liking. But in comparison with the price
    paid for the first one, 30 guilders, and taking into
    consideration that this last parcel (the first contained 12
    little ones, this one contained one small one; 4 like those I
    am now sending you; 2 large ones; so 7 pieces in all) was more
    important than the first, it seems to me that C. M. was not in
    a good mood when he received them, or that for some reason or
    other they did not please him.</label> I will readily admit that to an
    eye that is accustomed to watercolours exclusively, there might
    be something crude in drawings in which one has scratched with
    a pen and lights have been rubbed out or put in again with
    body-colour. But there are people who are not afraid of that
    crudeness, just as there are people who think it sometimes
    pleasant and invigorating for a healthy man to take a walk
    during a storm.</p>

    <p>Weissenbruch, for instance, would not think these drawings
    unpleasant or uninteresting.</p>

    <p>As things are, I should like to know whether C. M. would
    care to order new ones. Of course I will not or cannot force
    them on him, but I hope that when you come here, you will find
    out how things stand.</p>

    <p>Of course I am content with 20 guilders, particularly
    because I left it to him to fix the price; but I had thought
    that he would not give me 10 guilders less for these than for
    the previous lot. If he approves of my beginning another 6 or
    12 drawings for him, I shall certainly do so, because I shall
    not let any opportunity to sell something pass.</p>

    <p>I shall try my best to please him, for if it only pays my
    rent and makes things somewhat easier for me, it is worth
    while. But he himself had spoken of paying more rather than
    less for more elaborate drawings. And if I mention it, it is
    after all because I want to know what to do in case of a
    possible new order or no order at all. It may also be that he
    will write about it himself later on.</p>

    <p>One of these days when I have time, I shall send you a
    little list of my collection of wood engravings. I am sure you
    will like them.</p>

    <p>If it is true that last winter I have spent less for paint
    than other artists, <label content="art.equipment">I have spent <i>more</i> on making an
    instrument for studying proportion and perspective, the
    description of which can be found in a book by Albrecht
    D&uuml;rer, and which the old Dutch masters also used. It makes
    it possible to compare the proportion of objects near by with
    those on a more distant plane, in cases where construction
    according to the rules of perspective is not possible. And when
    one tries to do it <i>with the eye alone</i> - unless one is an
    expert and very far advanced - it is always hopelessly
    wrong.</p>

    <p>I did not succeed in making the instrument at once, but I
    managed it at last, after many efforts, with the help of the
    carpenter and the smithy. </label>And after more efforts, I see a
    chance to get even better results.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">I should be very pleased if you perhaps had in your wardrobe
    a discarded coat and pair of trousers fit for me. For when I
    buy something, I do my best to get things which are as
    practical as possible for working in the dunes or at home, but
    my street clothes are getting very shabby. And though I am not
    ashamed to wear common clothes when I go out to work, I am
    ashamed indeed of gentlemen's clothes that have a shabby
    genteel air. But my work clothes are not untidy at all, just
    because I have Sien to take care of them and make the necessary
    small repairs.</label></p>

    <p>I close this letter by repeating that I hope so much the
    family will not regard my relation with Sien as an intrigue,
    which it isn't at all. This would disgust me beyond words, and
    raise the barrier between us still higher. What I hope is that
    people with a certain untimely wisdom will not meddle in order
    to prevent my living with her. You speculated about an
    inheritance, but that is quite out of the question; there is
    nothing for me to inherit that I know of. There cannot be
    anything I think, for there <i>is</i> nothing; in my opinion
    they have literally <i>no</i> money at home. The only person
    from whom I might have inherited in quite different
    circumstances, because I am named after him - Uncle Vincent -
    is someone whom I have been on decidedly bad terms with for
    years, for various reasons; and things cannot be redressed as
    though I were his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Certainly I wouldn't
    wish it, and of course such a thing wouldn't occur to him,
    though I hope that if we meet by chance, like we did last year,
    we shall not have a public quarrel. And now, with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
