  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>In your letter of February 18 you said, &ldquo;When Tersteeg
    was here, we of course spoke about you and he told me that
    whenever you wanted anything, you could always go to
    him.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then why is it that when I asked Tersteeg some days ago for
    10 guilders, he gave them to me, but accompanied by so many
    reproaches - I might almost say insults - that I could hardly
    control myself, though I did. I would have thrown the 10
    guilders in his face if the money had been for myself, but I
    had to pay the model, a poor sick woman whom I cannot keep
    waiting. So I kept quiet. But for six months I will not go to
    Tersteeg again, or speak to him or show him my work.</p>

    <p>I'm not going to say that to him, but I'm saying it to
    you.</p>

    <p>Dear Theo, you may say, &ldquo;You must remain on good terms
    with Tersteeg, he is almost like an elder brother to us.&rdquo;
    But my dear fellow, he may be kind to you, but for years he has
    only shown his unfriendly and harsh side to me.</p>

    <p>He would have the right to reproach me if I did not work,
    but it is unjust to someone who toils patiently, hard, and
    continuously on a difficult work, to make reproaches like
    this:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Of one thing I am sure, you are no artist.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;One objection which has great weight with me is that
    you started too late.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;You must earn your own living.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Then I say, &ldquo;Stop, watch what you say.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>One cannot always be friends, one must quarrel sometimes. As
    to the arrangement between you and me about receiving money
    from you, when you come to The Hague, which I hope will be
    soon, I want to speak about that with you in Mauve's presence
    and with nobody else. Mauve's large picture will soon be
    finished, and then I suppose Mauve will give me some hints
    about watercolours again.</p>

    <p>The substance of what Mauve has said up to now is,
    &ldquo;Vincent, when you draw, you are a painter.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And therefore I have worked, and worked hard, on drawing, on
    proportion, on perspective, for weeks and weeks; Tersteeg
    doesn't fully appreciate this and only talks about
    &ldquo;things that don't sell.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I do not deserve his reproaches, but I will be calm because
    I certainly do respect him; therefore I say, After six months
    we shall speak to each other again, for six months we shall not
    see each other.</p>

    <p>If you can, send me the money for this month soon. I am
    making progress with my work, but cannot work without money or
    with too little.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I would rather go without dinner for six months and save in
    that way than occasionally receive 10 guilders from Tersteeg
    accompanied by his reproaches.</p>

    <p>I should like to know what painters would say to his
    argument, &ldquo;Work less from the model because it is
    cheaper,&rdquo; when after a long search one has found models
    who are not too expensive.</p>

    <p>Working without a model is the ruin of a painter of the
    figure.</p>
