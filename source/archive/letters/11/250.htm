  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>My warm thanks for your registered letter as well as for the
    little roll. I found Buhot's paper in it, but I should like to
    have had some explanation along with it, for instance, <i>with
    what</i> must one draw on this paper? Perhaps you will tell me
    that later.</p>

    <p>Renouard's &ldquo;Enfants Assist&eacute;s&rdquo; are
    splendid, also his new drawing, &ldquo;Banc des
    Accus&eacute;s,&rdquo; though the latter is less important
    than, for instance, his large prints of the &ldquo;Prison
    Mazas.&rdquo;' I am very glad to have them and thank you
    heartily.</p>

    <p>You will have received a copy of <art id=1663>a lithograph by now.</art>
    Frankly, it was a misprint, but I sent it to you because a few
    parts were exactly the way I intended the whole to be.</p>

    <p>This time the autographic ink blotted badly and it had to be
    fixed later, and black spots were everywhere. But look, for
    instance, at that left leg with the muddy shoe. This proves
    that this process can express material and can give
    characteristic effects. The hands and the head are bad, but in
    the print of the other old man they were the parts which were
    best. I <i>again</i> witnessed the transferring to the stone
    and the printing and I must tell you that I think great things
    can be done with this process.</p>

    <p>Today I was at Van der Weele's, who was rather pleased with
    <art id=1662>the little old man with his head in his hands;</art> he intends to
    try it himself. Sometimes he does wonderful things. He gave me
    four of his etchings, a sheepfold, calves in the underbrush,
    two sand carts and an ox plough, and I hope to get some more
    later when he has new prints made of them.</p>

    <p>He does not seem to have a great liking for Tersteeg, for
    without my telling him anything about the man, and while we
    were discussing the studies by V. d. W. himself, he said, Oh
    well, as soon as I do this or that and go to Tersteeg, he will
    make this or that unpleasant remark. I think this is true, and
    I really regret very much that this is the way things are. I
    would much rather have been mistaken in my opinion of Tersteeg,
    but I am afraid he is accustomed to discouraging many persons
    who deserve better. How tiresome such matters are.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I received a letter, not from Rappard but from his
    father, who tells me R. is sick. <label content="health.general">I do not know what ails him -
    perhaps, perhaps, it is what you and I know also.</label></p>

    <p>I infer this from some expressions in his last letter when
    he told me to continue the experiments in lithography, and said
    that he himself felt so low that he couldn't do anything. What
    a pity, isn't it? It is so hard when one has to give up work
    for such a foolish reason as indisposition.</p>

    <p>If I do not get news of his recovery soon, I have a good
    mind to go and see him. Recently we have corresponded rather
    frequently about our work; he has become quite enthusiastic
    about collecting wood engravings, for instance, and I think it
    quite possible that we shall become more and more interested in
    each other.</p>

    <p>At Van der Weele's I saw an excellent sketch of Breitner's,
    an unfinished drawing - perhaps it cannot be finished; it
    represents officers in front of an open window, bent over and
    deliberating about some map or battle plan. Breitner really has
    got a job at the high school in Rotterdam - a lucky thing for
    him. But l think after all it is preferable if one <i>can</i>
    manage to do without such jobs and give all one's time to one's
    work. There seems to be something fatal in occupying such
    positions; perhaps it is the very cares, the very dark, shadowy
    side of an artist's life which is the best of it. It is risky
    to say so, and there are moments when one speaks differently;
    many are drowned by too heavy cares, but those who struggle
    through will profit by it later.</p>

    <p>You write about the question of making drawings in a smaller
    size. I appreciate your speaking of that matter more calmly
    than others, who have said the same thing to me in quite a
    different way, and told me, If you don't work in a smaller
    size, this and that will happen. I think it preposterous and
    superficial to talk that way, and I can't believe what they say
    is true.</p>

    <p>Do you know what I think? All sizes have their advantages
    and disadvantages; in general, for my own study I decidedly
    need the figure with rather large proportions, so that the
    head, hands and feet will not be too small and one can draw
    them vigorously.</p>

    <p>So for my own practice I use the size of Exercices au Fusain
    by Bargue as an example; one can easily take that size in with
    one glance, and yet the details are not too small. But most
    artists use a smaller size. I have done it this way from the
    very beginning - sometimes a little smaller, sometimes a little
    larger; and as far as my own study is concerned, I should be
    acting contrary to my conviction if I changed.</p>

    <p>But though my attention centers on drawing the human figure
    on a good large scale - a thing which is exceedingly difficult,
    I assure you - this doesn't mean that I am absolutely bound to
    it. And so in answer to what you write, I shall ask you a
    question, Have you a particular work in mind? Has anybody told
    you something, for instance, like, If those figures were half
    the size, these drawings might be used for this or that? And if
    you know something or other about such a thing, for my part I
    should take the trouble either to reduce the figures I already
    have to half-size or draw new ones on a smaller scale.</p>

    <p>Without a definite reason I should think it less important
    than with one.</p>

    <p>If I send you a few figures, for instance, half the size of
    the former ones, and you should try to show them, though unable
    quite to tell me yet to whom or to what end, that would be
    reason enough for me to make them.</p>

    <p>What I said just now is only to show you how I have tried to
    keep some system in my work from the very beginning; I have set
    a kind of rule for myself - not to become the slave of that
    rule, but because it helps one to think more clearly.</p>

    <p>It is not at all difficult, for instance, to reduce a
    certain figure to half-size; sometimes, however, it loses
    something essential - sometimes the figure gains by it, too. At
    all events, I'll send you a few before long, but if you have
    something particular in mind, tell me what it is - it may help
    me in choosing my figures.</p>

    <p>Once more, thanks for what you sent. What I wrote in my last
    letter about the plan of publishing prints for the people is a
    thing I hope you will consider sometime. I myself have no fixed
    plan yet, seeing that in order to have it clearly before me, I
    have to do things in connection with the drawings themselves
    and with the process of reproduction. But I have no doubt of
    the possibility of doing such a thing, nor of its usefulness;
    nor can I doubt the possibility of finding people who would be
    sympathetic to it. Well, I think it might be done in such a way
    that no one would regret having contributed to it.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>While I am writing to you, I read your last letter once
    more, especially what you say about the size; I will give you
    an example of an artist whom you know, Th&eacute;ophile
    Schuler, who illustrated the works of Erckmann-Chatrian. One
    sees clearly from those small illustrations that he could work
    very well in a small size, though one can see it even better
    from the things he made at the time for L'Illustration and
    Magasin Pittoresque, among others, the Album des Vosges, to
    which Brion and Jundt also contributed.</p>

    <p>I think, however, that one would be very much mistaken in
    believing that such a thing as, for instance, the print
    &ldquo;Le B&eacute;n&eacute;dicit&eacute;&rdquo; [Grace before
    Meat] (a family of woodcutters and farmers at table) was made
    in one fell swoop. No, in most cases the solidity and pith of
    the small size is only acquired after much more serious study
    than those who think lightly of illustration work would
    suppose. Oh, boy, you are one of the best informed of the art
    dealers I know, and you speak about it with so much more truth
    and feeling than most of them; but if you knew the drudgery
    those little things have cost - as, for instance, the prints in
    the Album des Vosges or those first things in the Graphic - I
    think you would be awed by it.</p>

    <p>With me, at least, it is such that whenever I learn more
    about the life and works of people like Schuler, Lan&ccedil;on,
    Renouard and so many others, I perceive that what is seen of
    them is only a little wisp of smoke coming out of their
    chimneys, and that within their hearts and studios there is a
    big blaze. It is the same with an artist's illustration work as
    it is with a little church spire in the distance, it looks
    small and insignificant, but when one gets nearer, it proves to
    be quite an imposing edifice - I mean, only a small part of
    their work comes before the public.</p>

    <p>Well, some pictures make a big splash in their enormous
    frames, and later one is astonished because they leave such an
    empty, unsatisfied feeling; in contrast to this, some simple
    wood engraving or lithograph or etching is sometimes
    overlooked, but one comes back to it and becomes more and more
    attached to it, and feels something grand in it.</p>

    <p>I know a drawing by Tenniel representing &ldquo;Two
    Dominies&rdquo; (of course this is not the English title, but
    it is the subject): one is a city dominie, large, pompous and
    imposing; the other is rather shabby, a simple village curate,
    apparently the father of a large and poor family. I often think
    that one also finds those two types among painters; many
    illustrators belong to the village clergymen group of painters,
    whereas perhaps persons like Bouguereau and Makart and many
    others belong rather to the former type.</p>

    <p>Whether I personally have to work on a large or a small
    scale is immaterial to me, but what the illustrations demand is
    only part of what I ask of myself. Of myself I decidedly demand
    that I can draw the figure of a size such that head, hands and
    feet do not become too small and the details remain distinct. I
    cannot do this nearly as well as I have set myself to do it,
    and for that very reason I must not relax on this point. If I
    exact this, I demand no more of myself than many others do. So,
    for instance, about that series of drawings I am now working
    on, I do not know what the definite form or size will be. After
    long reflection I decided on the size of that little old man
    with his head in his hands, but when it comes to printing, I
    can of course reduce the size of these cartoons.</p>

    <p>And the practical reason for drawing the figures on a rather
    large scale is proved, for instance, by the Exercices au
    Fusain, de Mod&egrave;les d'apr&egrave;s les Ma&icirc;tres,
    published by Goupil and Co. I started with them, and up to now
    I have found no better guide to studies from the living model.
    This publication was intended to bring healthy ideas about
    study into the schools as well as and especially into the
    studio. I have listened to what Bargue says in his examples;
    though my work is far from being as beautiful as his, I believe
    the examples indicate a straight road in keeping with what
    other artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, have taught before.
    At all events, it gave a certain method to my ideas about
    drawing, which makes the work more systematic than it would be
    if one put no method into one's work. You see, this is a thing
    which I may not let go of, but I repeat, I can reduce the size
    of any figure among my studies if it's desirable.</p>

    <p>I must say, I am very eager for you to see all the things
    which I've made since last summer together. How about those
    drawings which you wrote me you sent via the Rue Chaptal? I
    have not received them yet, but I suppose they are still with
    you, because very shortly after that you wrote me that Buhot
    had seen some of them. Of course I am in no immediate hurry for
    them, and only ask in case they were left behind somewhere. And
    if you think it better to keep them with you so you can show
    them to someone some time or other, I have nothing against it,
    but I wish you could make a new choice out of the whole
    collection.</p>
