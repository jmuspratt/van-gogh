  <body>
    <p>Friday evening.</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I'm just adding a few words to last night's letter. <label content="health.venereal">And I
    can tell you that I have been to see the doctor at the
    hospital, who told me that as I had been fairly well these
    days, I need not come back unless I should happen to get worse.
    The fact that during these days I have been able to pass water
    freely, although not quite normally and painlessly yet, proves
    that I am on the road to recovery.</label></p>

    <p>This afternoon I at once sent a drawing to the doctor who
    treated me - not the superintendent - to show my gratitude. It
    was <art id=870>a Scheveningen girl knitting</art>, done at
    Mauve's studio, and really the best watercolour I had,
    especially since Mauve had put in some touches, and had watched
    me do it and called some details to my attention. I should have
    liked to keep it as a souvenir, but in the delight of recovery
    I felt the need to show my gratitude.</p>

    <p>Today I received a letter from Father and Mother, and wrote
    them as soon as I heard that I needn't go back to the
    hospital.</p>

    <p>Now I should like to take a trip to Scheveningen by
    streetcar tomorrow morning, and then draw a little on the
    beach.</p>

    <p>So my address is now Schenkweg No. 136.</p>

    <p>In acknowledgement of the honourable gentleman's visit, I
    also wrote a note to Mr. Tersteeg to tell him I had left the
    hospital, and thanked him for his unexpected visit.</p>

    <p>I should like to go to see Sien next Sunday. I had a note
    from her telling me that yesterday she was allowed to sit up
    for half an hour for the first time, and that the baby was all
    right.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">I get tired and exhausted very easily because I had to keep
    quiet in bed so long, and it is a queer feeling. But in many
    respects I feel well and better than last winter, and I am so
    cheerful and grateful for many things.</label></p>

    <p>I hope you will soon find a half hour to write me whether
    you approve of my telling Father and Mother in that way. First
    Sien must get a little stronger, for she must not be upset or
    anxious about anything at present, most decidedly not - but in
    a month or six weeks, depending on how her recovery
    progresses.</p>

    <p>She saw Father when he visited me, for it was visiting hour
    and she was siting in the hall downstairs waiting; but of
    course Father did not know her.</p>

    <p>It is already late, and I want to get up early tomorrow
    morning and go out with my drawing materials as if nothing had
    happened between now and the last time I sat in the dunes at
    Scheveningen. I wish I could succeed in making something for
    Rappard.</p>

    <p>Adieu, Theo, good night, how delightful it is to be back
    home again; best wishes and good luck, and what I especially
    wish you is that serenity I mentioned before. A handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>P. S. This &Eacute;mile Zola is a glorious artist. I am now
    reading Le Ventre de Paris; it is confoundedly clever.</p>
