  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>On second thoughts, it occurred to me that you must have
    found it odd to see a reference in my last letter to something
    I have never mentioned before, and a reference made, moreover,
    in a rather peremptory tone, something like: Theo, throw the
    whole lot overboard and become a painter, there is a famous
    paysagiste [landscape painter] inside you.</p>

    <p>These words might well have escaped me at the moment when my
    passions were aroused. But that doesn't alter the fact that it
    happens like that with other things that I allow to slip out in
    spite of myself sometimes, once I've got in a passion or have
    been aroused in some way or other. In other words, what I say
    at such times is what I've been bottling up for a long time and
    then blurt out, sometimes quite bluntly. But although in a
    calmer mood I would put it better, or keep it to myself, the
    fact is that, especially in a calm mood, I am most decidedly of
    that particular opinion.</p>

    <p>Now it is out, and out it must stay, I have said it at last
    in spite of myself - inadvertently - in short, bluntly - but
    now you know my innermost thoughts. And when I wrote,
    &ldquo;remain something better than H. G. T.&rdquo;, and when I
    intimated that I do not hold art dealers in general in high
    esteem - it's true, I could well have kept those things to
    myself, but now that my silence is broken and I have spoken -
    well then, that is how I will speak.</p>

    <p>As to H. G. T., I knew His Honour during a curious period of
    his life, when he had just `worked his way up' as they say,
    and, moreover, was newly married. At the time he made a strong
    impression on me - he was a practical man, tremendously able
    and good-humoured, energetic in small and large things, in
    addition he radiated poetry, so to speak, but poetry of the
    genuine, unsentimental sort. I felt so much respect for him at
    the time that I always kept my distance and looked upon him as
    a being of a higher order.</p>

    <p>Since - since - since then - I have come - more and more -
    to have my doubts - but I lacked the courage to take up an
    analytical scalpel to dissect him more closely. Now, however,
    having reached the point at which I must be very much on the
    qui vive and not allow my career to be ruined for no matter
    whom, the above-mentioned scalpel has not spared him. And all
    the time I sat in his small office or talked to him in the
    gallery with a perfectly natural expression on my face and
    asked him some very ordinary questions, I was taking his
    measure as cold-bloodedly as I knew how.</p>

    <p>I used to think he was the sort of person who put on the air
    of a man of means, of an homme du monde, I don't know how to
    put it in one word, I'm sure you'll take my meaning, and who
    hid a great deal of feeling and a warm heart behind that iron
    mask. But I found his armour enormously thick, so thick that I
    cannot make up my mind for sure whether the man is made of
    solid metal, be it steel or silver, or whether deep, deep down
    inside the iron there is one small corner in which a human
    heart still beats. If there is no heart in him, then my
    affection for him has truly run its course, making way for a
    &ldquo;Qu'est ce que tu me fais - toi? Tu m'agaces.&rdquo;
    [What are you doing to me? You are getting on my nerves.] So
    that in six months or a year he will either leave me utterly
    cold, or, or I will perhaps have found a way of getting on
    better with His Hon. Meanwhile - he is still His Hon. to me.
    Those are not the terms in which one thinks of somebody for
    whom one feels warm sympathy. &ldquo;His Hon.&rdquo; expresses
    something trite. Enough, suffit [that will do].</p>

    <p>Theo, I am definitely not a landscape painter, when I do
    landscapes <i>there will always be something of the figure in
    them</i>. However, it seems to me a very good thing that there
    are also people who are essentially `paysagistes'. And - the
    thought that you might be just such a person - sans le savoir
    [without knowing it] - greatly preoccupies me. I am just as
    preoccupied with the antithesis, namely whether you, Theo, are
    really cut out to be a dealer.</p>

    <p>If I had to prove the thesis, I might perhaps try to do so
    by indirect reduction. Quoi qu'il en soit [however that may
    be], do think it over. I don't need to tell you to consider
    carefully before you begin to paint, but perhaps you won't take
    it amiss if I add: Theo, until now you were free to do as you
    please but should you ever come to an arrangement with Messrs.
    G. &amp; C<sup>ie</sup> and promise to stay on in their
    business for the rest of your life, then you would be a free
    man no longer. And - it seems quite possible to me that there
    may come a moment in life when one regrets having committed
    oneself in that way.</p>

    <p>You will no doubt tell me, the moment may well arrive when
    one regrets having become a painter. And what could I then
    reply on my own behalf? They who have such regrets are those
    who neglect solid study in the beginning and who race
    hurry-scurry to be top of the heap. Well, the men of the day
    are men of just one day, but whoever has enough faith and love
    to take pleasure in precisely what others find dull, namely the
    study of anatomy, perspective and proportion, will stay the
    course and mature slowly but surely.</p>

    <p>When, pressed for money, I forgot myself for a moment and
    thought, I'll try to produce something with a particular
    appeal, the result was dreadful, I couldn't do it. And Mauve
    rightly became angry with me and said, that's not how to do it,
    tear that stuff up. A first I found that hard to do, but later
    I did cut them up. Then when I began to draw more seriously,
    Tersteeg took exception and became angry - and overlooked the
    good things in my drawings and asked straight out for ones that
    were `saleable'.</p>

    <p>Well, you can see immediately from this that there is a
    difference between Mauve and Tersteeg. Mauve appears more and
    more serious the more one thinks about him, but is Tersteeg
    going to be able to pass this test? I hope so, but doubt if he
    will stand up to it as well as M. And how about those who are
    serious at heart, although they often have something
    disagreeable about them? One gets to like them and to feel at
    home with them - one quickly gets bored with those who are not
    serious enough.</p>

    <p>You mustn't imagine that I have overlooked the change in
    your financial circumstances which a change of career would
    entail. But what makes me mention this matter to you at all is
    that although I find myself in financial difficulties, I
    nevertheless have the feeling that there is nothing more solid
    than a `handicraft' in the literal sense of working with one's
    hands. If you became a painter, one of the things that would
    surprise you is that painting and everything connected with it
    is quite hard work in physical terms. Leaving aside the mental
    exertion, the hard thought, it demands considerable physical
    effort, and that day after day.</p>

    <p>Well, I shall say no more about it now, except to add just
    this: when you come to Holland, I should like to speak to you
    alone, not just for half an hour but for, say, a whole morning,
    about some practical things which I have picked up - either
    from my own experience or from Mauve and others - just as if I
    had to explain them to you, teach them to you. I hope you won't
    have any objection - at worst you will be bored for a morning,
    but perhaps you won't be bored. I only hope that in the
    meantime you won't be thinking about the &ldquo;selling&rdquo;
    of pictures, but about the &ldquo;how to do it.&rdquo; And that
    you won't consider it being tempted by Satan. Enfin, nous
    verrons. [Well, we shall see.]</p>

    <p>If you could send me some money towards the end of this
    month, it would be very welcome. By then I also hope to have
    finished the 12 for C. M.! If he pays for them straight away,
    that will put 30 guilders in my pocket. <label content="lifestyle.clothing">If something from you
    were added to that, I would risk buying a few shirts and
    drawers which I need very, very badly, seeing that the shirts,
    etc., I own are really getting into a deplorable state and I
    have only a very few of them.</label></p>

    <p>Since I wrote to you I have been working with the same
    models the whole time and I must say I'm glad to have found
    them. I am busy drawing heads, and I urgently need to draw
    hands and feet as well (but it can't be done all at once). And
    when summer comes and the cold is no longer a handicap, I must
    needs in one way or another do some studies of the nude. Not
    exactly academic poses. But I would, for example, be
    tremendously pleased to have a nude model for a digger or a
    seamstress. From the front, from the back, from the side. To
    learn to see and sense the shape properly through the clothes
    and to have an idea of the movement. I estimate that about 12
    studies, 6 men, 6 women, would throw a lot of light on the
    matter. Each study takes a day's work. However, it is difficult
    to find models for this purpose, and if I can I shall avoid
    having a nude model hanging about in the studio in case I
    frighten the other models away.</p>

    <p>The fear &ldquo;that they will have to strip naked&rdquo; is
    usually the first scruple one has to overcome when approaching
    people about posing. Or at least that has been my experience
    here already more than once. Actually it even happened with a
    very old man, who would probably have been very Ribera-like as
    a nude model. But apr&egrave;s tout, I am not looking for a
    Ribera, still less a Salvator Rosa, I don't see things that
    way. I am not even enthusiastic about Decamps. I am ill at ease
    in front of their pictures and cannot visualize them without
    the feeling that I am missing something and losing sight of
    something. I'd rather have Goya or Gavarni, although both of
    them say &ldquo;Nada&rdquo;. As the last word? `Nada,' it seems
    to me, means precisely the same as Solomon's saying
    `Vanit&eacute; des vanit&eacute;s, tout est vanit&eacute;'
    [vanity of vanities, all is vanity], but that is something on
    which I cannot lay down my head without having nightmares. So
    there you are.</p>

    <p>However, it's too late to philosophize, seeing that I must
    be up at half-past five tomorrow morning, because the carpenter
    is coming round to do a job for me before he goes off to work.
    So goodnight and believe me, I mean it very seriously when I
    talk about your becoming a painter. Goodbye,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I've done two more small drawings for C. M., <art id=920>a bit of the
    Scheveningen road</art> and <art id=922>workers in the sand dunes</art>.</p>

    <p>Now that I've paid the money back to Tersteeg, I'm afraid
    that when the landlord comes round at the end of March I shan't
    have much left for him. So if you can, I do hope you will send
    me what you can towards the end of March.</p>

    <p>Theo, on Sunday I went round to De Bock's again - I don't
    know why, but every time I go and see him I get the same
    feeling: the fellow's too weak, he'll never make good - unless
    he changes, unless - unless - I see something weary, something
    blas&eacute;, something insincere in him that oppresses me,
    there is something consumptive about the atmosphere in his
    house.</p>

    <p>And yet - it doesn't hit you in the eye - and there are
    probably few among his acquaintances who think of him as I
    do.</p>

    <p>Well, anyway, he does do things that are nice sometimes, or
    at least not without charm and grace, but, &ccedil;a suffit-il?
    [Is that enough?] So much is demanded nowadays that painting
    seems like a campaign, a military campaign, a battle or a
    war.</p>
