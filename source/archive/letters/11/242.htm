  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>On Sundays I usually feel like writing you, and so I do
    today. The last few days I have been reading Le Nabab by
    Daudet, and I think it a masterpiece - for instance, that walk
    of Le Nabab and Heinerlingue, the banker, on
    P&eacute;re-Lachaise in the twilight, while the bust of Balzac,
    a dark silhouette against the sky, looks down on them
    ironically. That is exactly like a drawing by Daumier. You
    wrote me about Daumier that he had done &ldquo;La Revolution -
    Denis Dessoubs.&rdquo; When you wrote this, I didn't know who
    Denis Dessoubs was; now I have read about him in Histoire d'un
    Crime by Victor Hugo. He is a noble figure, I wish I knew the
    drawing by Daumier. Of course, I can't read any book about
    Paris without thinking at once of you. Nor can I read a book
    about Paris without finding in it something of The Hague, which
    is indeed much smaller than Paris, but is nevertheless a royal
    residence too, with its appropriate morals and manners.<br>
     When you say in your last letter, &ldquo;What a mystery nature
    is,&rdquo; I quite agree with you. Life in the abstract is
    already an enigma; reality makes it an enigma within an enigma.
    And who are we to solve it? However, we ourselves are an atom
    of that universe which makes us wonder: Where does it go, to
    the devil or to God ?<br>
     Pourtant le soleil se leve [yet the sun rises], says Victor
    Hugo. Long, long ago I read in L'Ami Fritz by Erckmann-Chatrian
    a saying of the old rabbi's, which I have always remembered:
    &ldquo;Nous ne sommes pas dans la vie pour etre heureux, mais
    nous devons tacher de meriter le bonheur.&rdquo; [We are not in
    life to be happy, but we must try to deserve happiness.] Taken
    separately, there is something pedantic in this thought - at
    least, one <i>might</i> take it as such - but in the context in
    which the words occurred, that is, from the mouth of that
    sympathetic figure of the old rabbi, David Sechel, they touched
    me deeply, and I often think of them. Similarly in drawing, one
    must not count on selling one's drawings, but it is one's duty
    to make them so that they have a certain value and are serious;
    one must not become careless or indifferent even though
    disappointed by circumstances. In regard to my plan for the
    lithographs, I have often thought it over; if I hadn't done
    more than that, I fear it wouldn't have advanced me much, so
    why think about it? Therefore I have made a few drawings for it
    again, a woman with a bag of coals on her head, with a yard in
    the background - a silhouette of roofs and chimneys and a woman
    at the washtub.<br>
     You needn't be afraid of my taking any other steps for the
    present apart from doing the drawings themselves. I must wait
    till I have some cash before I try any more experiments in
    lithography. But I think there is something in it.<br>
     At times I feel a great desire to be in London again. I should
    so much love to know more about printing and wood
    engravings.<br>
     I feel a power in me which I must develop, a fire that I may
    not quench, but must keep ablaze, though I do not know to what
    end it will lead me, and shouldn't be surprised if it were a
    gloomy one. In times like these, what should one wish for?</p>

    <p>What is relatively the happiest fate?<br>
     In some circumstances it is better to be the conquered than to
    be the conqueror - for instance, better to be Prometheus than
    Jupiter. Well, it is an old saying, &ldquo;Let come what
    may.&rdquo;<br>
     To change the subject, do you know whose work has impressed me
    deeply? I saw reproductions after <i>Julien</i> Dupr&eacute;
    (is he a son of Jules Dupr&eacute;?). One represented two
    mowers; the other, a beautiful large wood engraving from Monde
    Illustr&eacute;, a peasant woman taking a cow into the meadow.
    It seemed to me excellent work, very energetic and faithfully
    done. It resembles, for instance, Pierre Billet perhaps, or
    Butin.<br>
     I also saw a number of figures by Dagnan Bouveret, a beggar, a
    wedding, &ldquo;The Accident,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Garden of the
    Tuileries.&rdquo;<br>
     I think these two are fellows who wrestle man to man with
    nature, fellows who do not weaken and who have an iron grip.
    You wrote me about &ldquo;The Accident&rdquo; some time ago;
    now I know it and think it very beautiful. Perhaps they do not
    possess Millet's sublime, almost religious, emotion - at least
    not in the same degree as Millet himself - perhaps they do not
    feel the same full warm love as he, but still, how excellent
    they are! It is true I know them only from the reproductions,
    but I think there can be nothing in them that was not in the
    original work. By the way, it took a long time before I could
    admire Thomas Faed's work, but now I do not hesitate about it
    any more; for instance, &ldquo;Sunday in the Backwoods of
    Canada Home and the Homeless,&rdquo; &ldquo;Worn Out,&rdquo;
    &ldquo;The Poor Man's Friend" - in short, you know the series
    published by Graves.<br>
     Today I have been working on old drawings from Etten, because
    in the fields I saw the pollard willows in the same leafless
    condition again, and it reminded me of what I saw last year.
    Sometimes I have such a longing to do landscape, just as I
    crave a long walk to refresh myself; and in all nature, for
    instance in trees, I see expression and soul, so to speak. A
    row of pollard willows sometimes resembles a procession of
    almshouse men. Young corn has something inexpressibly pure and
    tender about it, which awakens the same emotion as the
    expression of a sleeping baby, for instance. The trodden grass
    at the roadside looks tired and dusty like the people of the
    slums. A few days ago, when it had been snowing, I saw a group
    of Savoy cabbages standing frozen and benumbed, and it reminded
    me of a group of women in their thin petticoats and old shawls
    which I had seen standing in a little hot water-and-coal shop
    early in the morning.<br>
     In regard to those figures I have mentioned which I should
    like to lithograph, I think the greatest difficulty will be to
    find about thirty which will fit together to make a whole. One
    must draw a great many more than thirty to get them.<br>
     If first I have those, reproduction is a second step, which I
    suppose will be easier than if one starts to reproduce before
    the whole is finished. Perhaps, or rather certainly, you will
    have been here before I have them all, and then we can talk
    about it some more.<br>
     Something like it has been done here for the primary schools,
    namely twenty-four lithographs by Schmidt Crans, which I saw
    recently. A few of them are good, but knowing the person who
    made them you will understand that the whole is rather insipid.
    It seems, however, that <i>they</i> are eagerly used at the
    schools, but what a pity that they content themselves with such
    things, particularly for educational purposes. Well, it's the
    same with that as it is with everything else.<br>
     But, boy, don't forget to read Le Nabab, it is splendid. One
    might call that figure a <i>virtuous scoundrel</i>. Do they
    really exist? I certainly think so. There is much heart in
    those books by Daudet - for instance, in Les Rois en Exil, that
    figure of the queen, &ldquo;aux yeux d'aigue-marine&rdquo;
    [with eyes of aquamarine].<br>
     Write again soon.</p>

    <p>How much good walking out to the desolate seashore and
    gazing out at the grey-green sea with the long white crests on
    its waves can do for a man who is downcast and dejected! But if
    one should have a need for something great, something infinite,
    something one can perceive God in, there is no need to go far
    in quest; it seems to me that I have seen something deeper,
    more infinite, more eternal than the ocean in the expression in
    a small child's eyes when it awakens early in the morning and
    yells or laughs on finding the dear sun shining upon it's
    cradle. If ever a &ldquo;rayon d'en haut,&rdquo; [a beam shines
    down from above] that may be where it is to be found.<br>
     Adieu, boy, with a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
