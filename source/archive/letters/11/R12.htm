  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>It pleases me to be able to send you the enclosed wood
    engravings. You will see that these too are somewhat damaged
    along the folds, which is not caused by the forwarding but
    rather by their having been so long in use in a public library.
    But you will be able to paste them together, as I myself have
    to do quite often. Please let me know whether you have a small
    figure of a woman by McQuoid - she is holding a light in her
    hand on the stairs of an armory, where one sees the glint of
    armour. I think I have already given it to you, as well as the
    &ldquo;Girl in White&rdquo; leaning against a tree, but if you
    do not have it, I shall add it to another batch some time.
    McQuoid is one of the most distinguished of the English
    illustrators. I think you will also like the Renouards - later
    on I may be able to add a few others, as the Jew told me he had
    part of the kit of old magazines (from which I took these as
    well as mine) at home; he had not brought them along because
    they were too badly damaged. As soon as I have time, I am going
    to hunt through that mess - which, by the way, is not a
    pleasant job.</p>

    <p>Personally I think &ldquo;The Strike of the Miners&rdquo;
    superb; I feel sure you will like it too.</p>

    <p>I have taken a lot of trouble to get things about miners.
    This and an English one of an accident are the most beautiful -
    but for the rest these subjects are rare - I wish I myself
    could make studies of them eventually. Do let me know, Rappard,
    but in all seriousness, whether - if I went away - for instance
    to the mining district of the Borinage for two months - you
    would like to come with me.</p>

    <p>It is rather a difficult stretch of country - such a journey
    is not a pleasure trip - but it is one of those things I should
    undertake with enormous pleasure as soon as I feel I have
    gained more dexterity in drawing people in action with
    lightning speed - for I know that there are so many beautiful
    things to do which have hardly, if ever, been painted by
    others. But because one has to contend with all kinds of
    difficulties in such a district, it would not be superfluous to
    have a friend along.</p>

    <p>Anyway, <i>at present</i> my circumstances would not permit
    it, but the thought is deeply rooted in my mind. Recently I
    have been working often on the beach, either drawing or
    painting. And I am more and more attracted by the sea.</p>

    <p>I don't know what your experience has been with artists here
    - more than once I have found that fellows started to abuse
    most maliciously what they call &ldquo;the illustrative,&rdquo;
    and this in a way that showed me quite clearly that they were
    wholly unacquainted with the subject, and hadn't the slightest
    idea of what is going on in this field. Moreover, they were not
    to be convinced, or rather they did not choose to take the
    trouble to look at things themselves. And when they did look,
    it remained in their heads for only a short time, and then went
    out of them radically.</p>

    <p>Now I know from my experience with you that you think quite
    differently about it.</p>

    <p>The other day I found some other things by Lan&ccedil;on: a
    &ldquo;Soup Distribution,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Gathering of rag
    pickers,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Snow-Cleaning Gang&rdquo;; I got up
    during the night to look at them again, so strong was the
    impression they had made on me. <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>And especially as I myself am working at trying to do things
    that interest me more and more - scenes in the street, the
    third-class waiting room, on the beach, in a hospital - my
    respect for those great black-and-white artists of the people,
    as for instance Renouard or Lan&ccedil;on or Dor&eacute; or
    Morin or Gavarni or du Maurier or Ch. Keene or Howard Pyle or
    Hopkins or Herkomer or Frank Hol, and countless others, is
    forever increasing.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you feel the same way to some extent.</p>

    <p>Well - however that may be - I always find it highly
    interesting that you are working away at subjects that are so
    very sympathetic to me, and at times I feel really sorry that
    we live rather far away from each other, and have relatively
    little contact with each other.</p>

    <p>I have no more time to write now, so receive a handshake in
    thought, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
