  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You have received my letter in which I wrote you how the
    idea of making figures <i>from the people for the people</i>
    developed of its own accord while I was working. How it seemed
    to me that it would be a good thing - not commercially but as a
    matter of public service and duty - if a few persons combined
    to do it.</p>

    <p>Since I wrote you this I have been thinking - not, of
    course, Who will do this or that? - but, What am I doing toward
    it? For the simple reason that I am not responsible for the
    former, but I certainly am for the latter. But this much I can
    tell you, all the time I was drawing with that purpose in mind
    the idea got more of a hold on me. That it would be useful to
    bring about such a thing and that it is not at all necessary to
    fall into a kind of imitation of other publications for the
    people, but, on the contrary, that the existence of such papers
    as the British Workman, for instance, can be a guide in showing
    how to do it and how not to do it.</p>

    <p>I do not know if you have read Dickens's Little Dorrit and
    if you remember in it the figure of Doyce, the man one could
    take as a type of those whose principle is How to do it. Even
    if you do not know that splendid workman's figure from the
    book, you will understand the fellow's character from this one
    phrase. When the thing he wanted to bring about was blocked by
    indifference and worse things, and he couldn't go on, he simply
    said, &ldquo;This misfortune alters nothing; the thing is just
    as true <i>now</i> (after the failure) as it was <i>then</i>
    (before the failure).&rdquo; And what had failed in England he
    started again on the Continent, and succeeded there.</p>

    <p>What I wanted to say is this. The idea of drawing types of
    workmen from the people for the people, distributing them in a
    popular edition and taking the whole as a matter of duty and
    public service - that and nothing but that - look here, that
    idea is enough to convince me that even if it didn't succeed at
    once, one might suppose, &ldquo;The thing is as true today as
    it was yesterday, and it will be as true tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And so it is a thing which one can begin and continue with
    serenity, a thing the good success of which one need not doubt
    or despair of - if only one doesn't relax or lose courage.</p>

    <p>I have said to myself that my first duty is to try my very
    best on the drawings. So that I have now made a few new ones
    since my last letter on the subject. In the first place,<art id=853> a
    Sower</art>. A big old fellow, a tall dark silhouette
    against a dark ground. Far away in the distance a little
    cottage with a moss-covered roof and a bit of sky with a lark.
    The man is a kind of cock type, a clean-shaven face, rather a
    sharp nose and chin, small eyes and sunken mouth. Long legs
    with jack boots.</p>

    <p>Then <art id=852>a second Sower</art>, with a light brown
    fustian jacket and trousers, so this figure stands out light
    against the black field, bordered by a little row of pollard
    willows. This is quite a different type, with a clipped beard,
    broad shoulders, rather thick-set, somewhat like an ox, in that
    his whole frame has been shaped by his labour in the fields.
    Perhaps more of an Eskimo type, thick lips, broad nose.</p>

    <p>Then a Mower with a large scythe on a meadow. The head with
    a brown woolen cap stands out against the clear sky.</p>

    <p>Then <art id=964>one of those little old fellows in a short jacket and
    big old top hat,</art> which one sometimes meets in the dunes. He is
    carrying home a basketful of peat.</p>

    <p>Now in these drawings I have tried to show my meaning even
    more clearly than in the old man with his head in his hands.
    These fellows are all in action, and this fact especially must
    be kept in mind in the choice of subjects, I think. You know
    yourself how beautiful the numerous figures in repose, which
    are done so very, very often, are. They are done more often
    than figures in action.</p>

    <p>It is always very tempting to draw a figure at rest; it is
    very difficult to express action, and in many people's eyes the
    former effect is more &ldquo;pleasant&rdquo; than anything
    else. But this &ldquo;pleasant&rdquo; aspect must not detract
    from the truth, and the truth is that there is more drudgery
    than rest in life. So you see my main idea about all this is -
    that for my part I try to work for the truth.</p>

    <p>It seems to me that the drawings themselves are even more
    urgent than their reproduction.</p>

    <p>I will also be chary of speaking about the matter, as I
    believe that a small circle of persons often acts more
    practically than when too many meddle with it. Too many cooks
    spoil the broth.</p>

    <p>How I wish we could be together more. Do you know why I have
    no doubt that I should be able to do it? You know the physical
    law that tells us that an object immersed in a liquid loses as
    much in weight as the specific weight of the volume of liquid
    displaced by the object. That is the reason why some objects
    float and why those which sink are lighter under water than in
    the air. Something like this - a kind of fixed law of nature -
    seems to exist in regard to the work, by which I mean that,
    once well into it, one feels more energy and power than one was
    aware of, or rather, than one in fact possesses.</p>

    <p>You would also experience this if you took up painting. At
    first it seems something unattainable, hopeless, but later
    things clear up, and I think you would see this in my work
    too.</p>

    <p>But something which I already wrote you about has proved
    true, namely Rappard is seriously ill. I have again heard from
    his father, who doesn't explain what it really is. I want to
    have as many drawings ready as possible against the time of his
    recovery, for I should like Rappard to do the same as soon as
    he takes up his work again. Rappard has something which not
    everybody possesses, he reflects and he cultivates his
    sentiment. He can make a plan, he can grasp a scheme in its
    entirety, he can stick to an idea.</p>

    <p>Many others call reflection and concentration inartistic
    because they at least are not fit for sustained labour. It is a
    question of both dexterity and quickness, and of perseverance
    and calm patience besides. Then Rappard possesses another
    quality which in my opinion makes him quite valuable for such
    an enterprise. He studies the figure carefully, not just as a
    touch of colour in a watercolour, but more seriously in its
    shape and structure.</p>

    <p>I often think that I should like to be able to spend more
    time on the real landscape!</p>

    <p>I often see things which I think splendid and which make me
    say involuntarily, I have never seen such a thing painted that
    way. But in order to paint it - how to do it - I should have to
    neglect other things. I should like to know if you agree with
    me in this, that in landscape much has been neglected - that
    &Eacute;mile Breton, for instance, has painted effects (and has
    continued to work in this direction) which are the beginnings
    of something new, which seems to me not to have reached its
    full strength, is understood by few and practiced by even
    fewer. Many landscape painters do not possess the same intimate
    knowledge of nature as those who have looked lovingly at the
    fields from childhood on. Many landscape painters give
    something which (though we appreciate them as artists)
    satisfies neither you nor me as human beings. They call
    &Eacute;mile Breton's work superficial - that's not true: his
    sentiment is superior to that of many others, he knows much
    more, and his work holds true.</p>

    <p>Indeed, in the field of landscape painting enormous gaps are
    beginning to show themselves, and I should like to apply
    Herkomer's words to it: the interpreters allow their cleverness
    to mar the dignity of their calling. And I believe the public
    will begin to say: deliver us from artistic compositions, give
    us back the simple field.</p>

    <p>How much good it does one to see a beautiful Rousseau on
    which he has drudged to keep it true and honest. How much good
    it does to think of people like Van Goyen, Old Crome and
    Michel. How beautiful an Isaac Ostade or a Ruysdael is.</p>

    <p>Do I want them back or do I want people to imitate them? No,
    but I want the honesty, the na&iuml;vet&eacute;, the truth, to
    remain.</p>

    <p>I know old lithographs by Jules Dupr&eacute;, either by
    himself or facsimiles of his sketches, but what pith and love
    is in them, yet how freely and easily they are done.</p>

    <p>The real thing is not an absolute copy of nature, but to
    know nature so well that what one makes is fresh and true -
    that is what so many lack.</p>

    <p>Do you suppose, for instance, that De Bock knows what you
    know? No, decidedly not. You will say that everybody has seen
    landscapes and figures from childhood on. The question is, Has
    everybody also been thoughtful as a child, has everybody who
    has seen them really <i>loved</i> the heath, fields, meadows,
    woods, and the snow and the rain and the storm? <i>Not</i>
    everybody has done this the way you and I have: a peculiar kind
    of surroundings and circumstances must contribute to it, and a
    peculiar kind of temperament and character must help it take
    root.</p>

    <p>I remember letters from you, when you were still in
    Brussels, with descriptions of landscapes like the one in your
    last one. <i>Do you know that it is so very, very necessary for
    honest people to remain in art?</i> I do not mean to say that
    there are none, but you feel what I mean, and know as well as I
    how many painters are inveterate liars.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Honesty is the best policy&rdquo; is applicable here,
    too, as well as the fable of the tortoise and the hare and
    Andersen's ugly duckling.</p>

    <p>Edwin Edwards, the etcher, for instance, why is his work so
    splendid, why is he justly ranked among England's best? Because
    what he aims at is faithfulness and truth. I would rather be
    Jules Dupr&eacute; than Edwin Edwards, but, you see, we must
    have great respect for sincerity: it lasts where other things
    are proved to be dry chaff. For me Bernier's &ldquo;The Fields
    in Winter&rdquo; in the Luxembourg is ideal.</p>

    <p>There is Lavieille, the wood engraver and painter - I just
    remembered having seen &ldquo;A Winter Night&rdquo; by him with
    a true Christmas sentiment.</p>

    <p>There is Mme Collard - for instance, that picture of an
    apple orchard with an old white horse.</p>

    <p>There is Chintreuil and Goethals (I have often tried to
    think of somebody whose work can be compared with Goethal's
    beautiful things - I think it is Chintreuil), but in reality I
    haven't seen much of Chintreuil's work, or of Goethal's, for
    that matter.</p>

    <p>To a great extent the cause of the evil lies in the fact
    that the intentions of the great landscape painters have been
    misconstrued. Hardly anyone knows that the secret of beautiful
    work lies mainly in truth and sincere sentiment.</p>

    <p>Many people cannot help their lack of depth, and they act in
    good faith as far as they have good faith. But I believe you
    will agree with me on the fact (the more so because this is a
    question of something which, though it concerns you, has no
    direct relation to you) that if many a landscape painter who
    now has quite a reputation had half the sound ideas about
    nature which seem to come naturally to you, he would produce
    much better and more sincere work. Think it over, and put this
    and many other things besides into the balance when, weighing
    yourself, you say such things as &ldquo;I should only be
    mediocre&rdquo; - unless you use <i>mediocre</i> in its right
    and noble sense.</p>

    <p><i>Smartness</i>, as they call it here, the word is used so
    much - I myself do not know its real meaning, and have heard it
    applied to very insignificant things - is smartness what must
    save art? I should have better hope of things going all right
    if there were more people like Ed. Fr&egrave;re or &Eacute;mile
    Breton, for instance, than if there were many smart people like
    Boldini or Fortuny. Fr&egrave;re and Breton will be missed and
    mourned. Boldini, Fortuny - one may respect them as <i>men</i>,
    but their influence has been fatal. A fellow like Gustave Brion
    has left something good - De Groux, for instance, also; if many
    people were like them the world would be the better for it, art
    would be a blessing. But Boldini, Fortuny, even Regnault - how
    did they help us, what progress did they bring? What you say is
    quite true, &ldquo;Earnestness is better than irony, no matter
    how sharp and witty it is.&rdquo; In other words, I should say,
    &ldquo;Bont&eacute; vaut mieux que malice&rdquo; [Goodness is
    worth more than malice], that is self-evident; but many people
    say, &ldquo;No, malice, that is <i>it</i>.&rdquo; Well, they
    will have to reap what they sow.</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, I wanted to write you about those drawings,
    namely that I hope that idea of prints for the people will help
    me make some progress. While I am writing you, news has come
    from Rappard that there is a little change for the better, but
    he seems to be very ill. I know for sure that he, as well as
    his father, is interested in those types from the people. As
    soon as Rappard is up and around again, or at least as soon as
    his eyes are normal again, I hope to go to see him.</p>

    <p>I shall write soon again, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
