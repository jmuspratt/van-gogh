  <body>
    <p>Theo,</p>

    <p>Since I wrote Mauve: &ldquo;Do you know that those two
    months you spoke of have long since passed? Let us shake hands,
    and then each go his own way, rather than have a quarrel
    between you and me,&rdquo; I repeat, since I wrote this and
    received no sign in reply, my grief chokes me.</p>

    <p>Because - and you know this - I love Mauve, and it is so
    hard that all the happiness he pictured to me will come to
    naught. For I am afraid that the better my drawings become, the
    more difficulty and opposition I shall meet.<label content="lifestyle.appearance"> Because I shall
    have to suffer much, especially from those peculiarities which
    I <i>cannot</i> change. First, my appearance and my way of
    speaking and my clothes; and then, even later on when I earn
    more, I shall always move in a different sphere from most
    painters because my conception of things, the subjects I want
    to make, inexorably demand it.</label></p>

    <p>Enclosed is a little sketch of diggers, I will tell you why
    I'm sending it. Tersteeg said to me, &ldquo;You failed before
    and now you will fail again - it will be the same story all
    over again.&rdquo; Stop - no, it is quite different now, and
    that reasoning is really nothing but a sophism.</p>

    <p>My not being fit for business or for professional study does
    not prove at all that I am not fit to be a painter. On the
    contrary, if I had been able to be a clergyman or an art
    dealer, then perhaps I should not have been fit for drawing and
    painting, and I should neither have resigned nor accepted my
    dismissal as such.</p>

    <p>I cannot stop drawing because I really have a draughtsman's
    fist, and I ask you, have I ever doubted or hesitated or
    wavered since the day I began to draw? I think you know quite
    well that I pushed on, and of course I gradually grew stronger
    in the battle.</p>

    <p>Now, to come back to this sketch - it was done on the Geest,
    in the rain, in a street where I was standing in the mud, amid
    all the noise and confusion, and I send it to you to show that
    my sketchbook proves I try to catch things &ldquo;in
    motion.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Now put Tersteeg himself, for instance, in front of a sand
    trench on the Geest, where workmen are busy putting in water or
    gas pipes; I should like to see what face he would pull and
    what kind of sketch he would make of it. Strolling on wharves
    and in alleys and streets and in the houses, waiting rooms,
    even saloons, is not a pleasant pastime, <i>except for an
    artist</i>. As such, one would rather be in the dirtiest place
    where there is something to draw than at a tea party with
    charming ladies. Unless one wants to draw ladies - then a tea
    party is all right even for an artist. What I want to say is
    this, searching for subjects, living among working people, the
    worry and trouble with models, drawing from nature on the very
    spot, is rough work, even dirty work at times. Indeed, a
    salesman's manners and clothes are not exactly the most
    suitable for me, or for anyone else who does not have to talk
    with fine ladies and rich gentlemen and sell them expensive
    things and make money, but who has, for instance, to draw
    diggers in a trench on the Geest. If I could do what Tersteeg
    can, if I were fit for that, I would not be fit for my
    profession; for my profession it is better that I am as I am
    than that I squeeze myself into forms which do not fit me.</p>

    <p>I, who did not feel at ease in a fine store, who would not
    feel so especially now, and would certainly be bored and bore
    others - I am quite a different person when I am at work on the
    Geest or on the heath or in the dunes. <label content="lifestyle.appearance">Then my ugly face and
    shabby coat harmonize perfectly with the surroundings and I am
    myself and work with pleasure. As for the &ldquo;how to do
    it,&rdquo; I hope to be able to push on.</p>

    <p>When I wear a fine coat, the working people that I want for
    models are afraid of me and distrust me, or they want more
    money from me.</label></p>

    <p>Well, I struggle along as well as I can, and I don't think I
    belong among those who complain, &ldquo;There are no models in
    The Hague.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So if remarks are made about my habits - meaning dress,
    face, manner of speech - what answer shall I make&hellip;that
    such talk annoys me?</p>

    <p>Am I ill-mannered in another sense, that is, insolent and
    indelicate?</p>

    <p>Look here, in my opinion all politeness is founded on
    goodwill towards everybody, founded on the necessity everyone
    who has a heart in his breast feels, to help others, to be of
    use to somebody, and finally, on the need to live together, and
    not alone. Therefore I do my best; I draw, not to annoy people,
    but to amuse them, or to make them see things which are worth
    observing and which not everybody knows.</p>

    <p>I cannot believe, Theo, that I could be such a monster of
    insolence and impoliteness as to deserve to be cut off from
    society, or as Tersteeg says, &ldquo;should not be allowed to
    stay in The Hague.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Do I lower myself by living with the people I draw? Do I
    lower myself when I go into the houses of labourers and poor
    people and when I receive them in my studio?</p>

    <p>I think my profession requires it, and only those who don't
    understand anything of painting or drawing could object to
    it.</p>

    <p>I put the question, where do the draughtsmen who work for
    the Graphic, Punch, etc., get their models? Do they personally
    hunt for them in the poorest alleys of London - yes or no?</p>

    <p>And their knowledge of the people, were they born with it -
    or did they acquire it in later years by living among the
    people and paying attention to things that many another
    overlooks, by remembering what many another forgets?</p>

    <p>When I go to see Mauve or Tersteeg I cannot express myself
    as I should wish, and perhaps I do myself more harm than good.
    When they are more accustomed to my way of speaking, they will
    no longer take offense.</p>

    <p>But do tell them now, in my name, how things are - that if I
    have hurt them in speech or action, I hope they will forgive
    me. Tell them in better words than I can, with as much style
    and grace as necessary, how <i>they</i> on their part have
    caused <i>me</i> much sorrow, much grief, much trouble in these
    few months which have seemed so long to me because of all these
    worries. <i>Make them understand this, they don't know it: they
    think I am unfeeling and indifferent.</i></p>

    <p>You will render me a great service by doing this, and I
    think things can be settled in this way.</p>

    <p>I wish they would just take me as I am. Mauve has been kind
    to me and has helped me thoroughly and well, but - it lasted
    only a fortnight - <i>that is too short</i>.</p>

    <p>Adieu, Theo, try to do what you can. If I have some good
    luck instead of bad luck, I needn't be such a burden on you.
    Enough for this time, believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely. Vincent</p>

    <p>[On a separate sheet]</p>

    <p>You have doubtless heard about Father's new call, and that
    Mother is well again but Uncle Cent is sick. I am working on
    the drawings for C. M., but lately I have been so depressed by
    the things I wrote you about that they interfered with my work;
    and then I thought, I want to see light, perhaps Theo can give
    me some information.</p>

    <p>It is not surprising that it depressed me, for Tersteeg told
    me to my face that I &ldquo;<i>should not be able to stay in
    The Hague</i>&rdquo;; and I thought he is certainly the kind of
    person who, once his mind is made up, will try to obstruct or
    thwart me in all things. But how is it possible, and what's got
    into him? Even if he doesn't think my drawings any good, is
    that any reason for crossing me so determinedly, and with such
    weapons?</p>

    <p>[Written in the margin}</p>

    <p>Where there is a difference of opinion in artistic matters I
    do not consider taking the bread out of somebody's mouth an
    honest weapon, nor taking steps to make his friends turn
    against him because of circumstances in his private life.</p>

    <p>Occasionally I have wanted to pick a quarrel with somebody
    who often got bread from me. No, I thought, I can't do this; I
    will put up with it, for otherwise he will have nothing to eat.
    You see? But people with certain &ldquo;distinguished
    manners&rdquo; have different ideas about such things.</p>
