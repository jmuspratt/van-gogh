    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>You must not take it amiss if I write you again - it is only
    to tell you that painting is such a joy to me.</p>

    <p>Last Saturday night I attacked a thing I had been dreaming
    of for a long time. It is a view of the flat green meadows,
    with haycocks. It is crossed by a cinder path running along a
    ditch. And on the horizon in the middle of the picture the sun
    is setting, fiery red.[Painting lost]</p>

    <p>[<art id=253_V-T_2250>Sketch of the work drawn here.</art>]</p>

    <p>I cannot possibly draw the effect in such a hurry, but this
    is the composition.</p>

    <p>But it was purely a question of colour and tone, the variety
    of the sky's colour scheme - first a violet haze, with the red
    sun half covered by a dark purple cloud which had a brilliant
    fine red border; near the sun reflections of vermilion, but
    above it a streak of yellow, turning into green and then into
    blue, the so-called <i>cerulean blue</i>; and then here and
    there violet and grey clouds, catching reflections from the
    sun.</p>

    <p>The ground was a kind of carpetlike texture of green, grey
    and brown, but variegated and full of vibration - in this
    colourful soil the water in the ditch sparkles.</p>

    <p>It is something that &Eacute;mile Breton, for instance,
    might paint.</p>

    <p>Then I have painted <art id=002a>a huge mass of dune ground - thickly
    painted and sticky</art>.</p>

    <p>And as for these two, <art id=002>the small marine </art>and the potato field,
    <i>I am sure no one could tell that they are my first painted
    studies</i>.</p>

    <p>To tell you the truth, it surprises me a little. I had
    expected the first things to be a failure, though I supposed
    they would improve later on; but though I say so myself, they
    are not bad at all, and I repeat, it surprises me a little.</p>

    <p>I think the reason is that before I began to paint, I had
    been drawing so much and had studied perspective in order to
    build up the composition of the thing I saw.</p>

    <p>Now, since I have bought my paint and brushes, I have
    drudged and worked so hard on seven painted studies that right
    now I'm beat. One of them has a figure in it, a mother with her
    child, in the shadow of a large tree, in tone against the dune,
    on which the summer sun is shining - almost an Italian effect.
    I simply couldn't restrain myself or keep my hands off it or
    allow myself any rest.[Painting lost]</p>

    <p>As you perhaps know, there is an exhibition of the Black and
    White Society. There is a drawing by Mauve - a woman at a
    weaving loom, probably in Drenthe - which I think superb.</p>

    <p>No doubt you saw some of them at Tersteeg's. There are
    splendid things by Isra&euml;ls - including a portrait of
    Weissenbruch, with a pipe in his mouth and his palette in his
    hand. By Weissenbruch himself, beautiful things - landscapes
    and also a marine.</p>

    <p>There is a very large drawing by J. Maris, a splendid town
    view. A beautiful W. Maris, among other things, a sow with a
    litter of pigs, and cows. Neuhuys, Duch&acirc;tel, Mesdag. By
    the last, besides a fine large marine, two Swiss landscapes
    which I think rather stupid and dull. But the large marine is
    splendid.</p>

    <p>Isra&euml;ls has four large drawings, a girl at the window,
    children near a pigsty - the sketch for the little picture at
    the Salon - a little old woman kindling the fire in the
    twilight, at the time engraved for the Art Chronicle.</p>

    <p>It is very inspiring to see such things, for then I perceive
    how much I still have to learn.</p>

    <p>But this much I want to tell you - while painting, I feel a
    power of colour in me that I did not possess before, things of
    broadness and strength.</p>

    <p>Now I am not going to send you things at once - let it ripen
    a little first - but know that I am full of ambition and
    believe that for the present I am making progress. (In three
    months, however, I will send something to give you an idea of
    how I'm getting on.) But that is just the reason for me to
    persevere and to acquire what I need.</p>

    <p>So do not think that I am satisfied with myself from what I
    say about my work - the contrary is true; but I think this much
    is gained: in the future when something strikes me in nature, I
    shall have more means than before with which to give it new
    vigour.</p>

    <p>And I am not displeased that what I shall make in the future
    will look more attractive.</p>

    <p><label content="health.general">Neither do I believe that it will hinder me if my health
    should give way a little from time to time.</label> As far as I can
    see, the painters who occasionally cannot work for a week or
    two are not the worst ones. It may be because they are the ones
    &ldquo;qui y mettent leur peau,&rdquo; as father Millet says.
    That doesn't matter, and in my opinion one must not spare
    oneself when there is something important to do. If a short
    period of exhaustion follows, it will soon pass, and so much is
    gained that one harvests one's studies just the way a farmer
    harvests his crops. Now for myself, I have not yet thought of
    taking a rest. Only yesterday, Sunday, I did not do so much -
    at least I did not go out to paint. I will see to it that even
    if you come this winter, you will find the studio full of
    painted studies.</p>

    <p>I had a letter from Rappard yesterday; he has been to
    Drenthe, and judging from the two little sketches he sent me,
    he has not been idle. He seems to work very hard and well, too
    - figures as well as landscape.</p>

    <p>Well, adieu, I must set off to work again; with a
    handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>It is now just <i>two</i> years since I began to draw in the
    Borinage.</p>
