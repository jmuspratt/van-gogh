  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your last letter with the 100 fr. enclosed in
    good order, and thank you very warmly for sending it.</p>

    <p>I should have acknowledged it at once, but I was very busy
    with a few drawings, for which I had a model.</p>

    <p>For you should bear in mind that if you are busy, it is the
    same with me, and will be increasingly so because my work is
    becoming more and more absorbing to me, and it is only with
    effort that I tear myself away from it to write a letter or
    call on someone when necessary.</p>

    <p>I was very glad that you wrote that you would soon come to
    Holland. After you have seen what I have been doing lately, we
    shall perhaps get a clearer understanding of the future. When
    you come, I hope we shall spend some quiet time in the studio,
    and I also hope you will let me know beforehand so that I can
    arrange things with my model, and not have her during the days
    of your visit.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.father">You write about Father's birthday. I must tell you that I am
    so glad to be free of it all, it gives me such a feeling of
    tranquillity, something I need so much for my work. My head
    cannot hold more than it does, and I dread beginning a new
    correspondence so much that for the present I am leaving things
    as they are. When I think of Etten it gives me the shudders, as
    if I were in church. Well, qu'y faire, and once more qu'y
    faire?</label></p>

    <p>By the way, you must not take it amiss, Theo, or think I'm
    finding fault with you, but you wrote me something which you
    thought would perhaps please me, but it didn't please me at
    all. You said that small watercolour was the best of mine that
    you had seen - well, it isn't, because those studies of mine
    which you have are much better, and last summer's pen drawings
    are better too. That little drawing is of no importance
    whatever, I only sent it to show you that it is not impossible
    that I may work in watercolour sometime. But there is much more
    serious study and more character in those other things, though
    they may look rather yellow-soapy. And if I had anything
    against Mr. Tersteeg (but I have nothing against him), it would
    be the same thing, which is that he encourages me not in the
    difficult study from the model, but rather in a style of work
    which really is only half fit to render what I want to express,
    according to my own character and my own temperament.</p>

    <p>Of course I should be very happy to sell a drawing, but I am
    happier still when a real artist like Weissenbruch says about
    an unsaleable??? study or drawing, &ldquo;That is true to
    nature, I could work from it myself.&rdquo; although money is
    of great value to me, especially now, the principal thing is
    for me to make something serious.</p>

    <p>Well, the same thing that Weissenbruch said about a
    landscape, a peat bog, Mauve said about the figure, i.e., <art id=863>an
    old peasant who sits brooding by the hearth</art>, as
    if he saw things from the past rising in the glow of the fire
    or in the smoke.</p>

    <p>It may take a longer or a shorter time, but the surest way
    is to penetrate deep into nature. &ldquo;Il reste &agrave;
    &ecirc;tre vrai,&rdquo; Gavarni says. One may be in pecuniary
    difficulties for some time; but one gets over that, and then
    the drawings that were refused at first are sold.</p>

    <p>I have written C. M. to tell him that I have taken a studio
    here, and he wrote back that he will be coming to The Hague
    soon, and will visit me then. The other day I received
    greetings from my old friend Wisselingh in London; he promised
    to come too, and he was glad that I was working.</p>

    <p>Well, I hope you will succeed in getting a vacation, for I
    long very much to see you. I think when you have seen these
    last weeks' studies, you will quite approve of my having models
    regularly. Of course I can draw the models better when I have
    come to know them well. And I have had rather good luck in
    finding them.</p>

    <p>Today while I am writing you I have a child who has to rest
    for half an hour, and I'm using the half hour for this
    letter.</p>

    <p>Once more thanks for what you sent me and a handshake in
    thought. Adieu.</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>P.S. I have made <art id=983>two more studies</art> of <art id=984>the child </art>today. It is
    getting dark now. Good night.</p>
