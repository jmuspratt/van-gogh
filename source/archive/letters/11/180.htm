  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Perhaps you will think what I wrote you about Tersteeg
    rather harsh. But I cannot take it back. He must be told
    straight out, or else it doesn't penetrate his armour. For
    years he has considered me a kind of incompetent dreamer; he
    still does; and even says of my drawing, &ldquo;That is a kind
    of narcotic which you take in order not to feel the pain not
    being able to make watercolours causes you.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Well, that's a very fine idea, but it is thoughtless,
    superficial and not to the point; the main reason for my not
    being able to make watercolours is that I must draw even more
    seriously, paying greater attention to proportions and
    perspective.</p>

    <p>Enough of that. I don't deserve his reproaches, and if my
    drawings don't amuse him, then it doesn't amuse me to show them
    to him.</p>

    <p>He condemns my drawings, which have a great deal of good in
    them, and I did not expect this of him.</p>

    <p>If I make serious studies after the model, it is much more
    practical than his practical talks about what is saleable or
    unsaleable; I do not need so much instruction on that as he
    supposes, having been in the business of selling pictures and
    drawings myself. So I would rather lose his friendship than
    give in to him in this matter.</p>

    <p>Though there are moments when I feel overwhelmed by care, I
    am still calm, and my calmness is founded on my serious method
    of work and on earnest reflection. Though I have moments of
    passion aggravated by my temperament, yet I am calm, as he who
    has been acquainted with me so long knows quite well. Even now
    he said to me, &ldquo;You have too much patience.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>That's not right - in art one cannot have <i>too much</i>
    patience - it's out of all proportion. Perhaps in my case Mr.
    Tersteeg has <i>too little</i> patience.</p>

    <p>He must see now, once and for all, that I take things
    seriously and will not let myself be forced to produce work
    that does not show my own character. My own character has begun
    to show especially in my last drawings and studies, which
    Tersteeg condemned.</p>

    <p>Perhaps, perhaps I could succeed even now in making a
    watercolour that would sell if one tried very hard. But that
    would be forcing watercolours in a hothouse. Tersteeg and you
    must wait for the natural season, and that is not here yet.</p>

    <p>He spoke English when he was here because of the model. I
    said to him, In due time you will have your watercolours, but
    not now - they are not due yet, take your time. And that is all
    I have to say. Enough of it.</p>

    <p>Since Tersteeg's visit I made a drawing of a boy from the
    orphanage, blacking shoes. It may be this is done by a hand
    that does not quite obey my will, but still the boy's type is
    there. And though my hand may be unruly, that hand will learn
    to do what my head wishes. So I have made a sketch of the
    studio with the stove, the chimney, easel, footstool, table,
    etc., of course not quite saleable at present, but very useful
    for practicing perspective.</p>

    <p>I am longing for your visit, there are so many things for
    you to see that I have made since you were here last summer.
    Theo, I count on your judging my work with sympathy and with
    confidence, and not with hesitation and dissatisfaction.</p>

    <p>Because I work so much, Tersteeg thinks it is so easy; in
    that he is also quite wrong. For in fact I am a drudge or a
    plodding draft ox.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">Do not forget the Ingres paper when you come. It is
    especially the <i>thick</i> kind that I like to use and which I
    think must also be good for studies in watercolour.</label></p>

    <p>Believe me, in art matters the saying, &ldquo;Honesty is the
    best policy,&rdquo; is true; rather more trouble on a serious
    study than a kind of chic to flatter the public. Sometimes in
    moments of worry I have longed for some of that chic, but
    thinking it over I say, No, let me be true to myself, and
    express severe, rough but true things in a rough manner. I
    shall not run after the art lovers or dealers; let whoever
    wants to come to me. In due time we shall reap, if we faint
    not!</p>

    <p>Say, Theo, what a big man Millet was! I borrowed Sensier's
    great work from De Bock; it interests me so much that I wake up
    at night and light the lamp and sit up to read. For I must work
    in the daytime.</p>

    <p>Do send me some money soon, if possible. I wish Tersteeg had
    to live for a week on what I have to spend, and had to do what
    I have to do. Then he would see that it is not a question of
    dreaming and brooding, or of taking narcotics, but that one
    must be wide-awake to fight against so many difficulties.
    Neither is it easy to find models and get them to sit for me.
    This discourages most painters. Especially when one must save
    on food, drink, and clothes to pay them.</p>

    <p>Well, Tersteeg is Tersteeg, and I am I.</p>

    <p>But let me tell you that I am not opposed or hostile to him,
    but I must make him understand that he judges me too
    superficially, and - and I believe that he will change his
    opinion; I fervently hope so, for it grieves and worries me
    when there is an unfriendly feeling between us.</p>

    <p>I hope your letter will come soon - I spent my last penny on
    a stamp for this letter. It is true I received the 10 guilders
    from Tersteeg only a few days ago, but that same day I had to
    pay 6 of those guilders to the model, to the baker, to the
    little girl who sweeps the studio.</p>

    <p>Adieu, I wish you health and courage; in spite of
    everything, I myself am not without good courage.</p>

    <p>Je te serre la main,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I have had a very pleasant visit from Jules Bakhuyzen [A
    Dutch painter], and I may go to see him whenever I like.</p>

    <p>[Postscript]</p>

    <p><i>Theo, it is almost miraculous!!!</i></p>

    <p><label content="business.sales">First comes your registered letter, second, C. M. asks me to
    make 12 small pen drawings for him, views of The Hague, apropos
    of some that were ready. (<art id=918>The Paddemoes</art>, <art id=914>the
    Geest </art>and the Vleersteeg were finished.) At 2.50 guilders
    apiece, price fixed by me, with the promise that if they suit
    him, he will take 12 more at his own price, which will be
    higher than mine.</label> In the third place, I just met Mauve, happily
    delivered of his large picture, and he promised to come and see
    me soon. So, &ldquo;&ccedil;a va, &ccedil;a marche, &ccedil;a
    ira encore!&rdquo;</p>

    <p>And another thing touched me - very, very deeply. I had told
    the model not to come today - I didn't say why, but
    nevertheless the poor woman came, and I protested. &ldquo;Yes,
    but I have not come to pose - I just came to see if you had
    something for dinner.&rdquo; She had brought me a dish of beans
    and potatoes. There are things that make life worth living
    after all. The following words in Sensier's Millet appealed to
    me, and touched me very much, sayings of Millet's:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;L'art c'est un combat - dans l'art il faut y mettre
    sa peau.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Il s'agit de travailler comme plusieurs
    n&egrave;gres: <i>J'aimerais mieux ne rien dire que de
    m'exprimer faiblement</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>[Art is a fight - one must put one's hide (i.e. one's
    utmost) into art.</p>

    <p>The thing to do is to work like a lot of Negroes: I would
    rather say nothing than express myself feebly.]</p>

    <p>It was only yesterday that I read this last saying of
    Millet's, but I felt the same thing before; that's why I
    sometimes like to scratch what I want to express with a hard
    carpenter's pencil or a pen instead of with a soft brush. Take
    care, Tersteeg, take care, you are decidedly wrong.</p>
