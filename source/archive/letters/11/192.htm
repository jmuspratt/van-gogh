  <body>
    <p>Please feel free to tell Mauve anything you like about the
    contents of this letter, but there is no need for it to go any
    further.</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I met Mauve today and had a most regrettable conversation
    with him, which made it clear to me that Mauve and I have
    parted for good. Mauve has gone too far to retract, and anyhow
    he certainly wouldn't want to.</p>

    <p>I invited him to come and see my work, and then to talk
    things over. Mauve flatly refused: `I will certainly not be
    coming to see you, that's all over.'</p>

    <p>In the end he said, `You have a vicious character.' I turned
    away then - it was in the dunes - and walked home alone.</p>

    <p>Mauve takes it amiss that I said, `I am an artist,' which I
    won't take back, because it's self-evident that what that word
    implies is looking for something all the time without ever
    finding it in full. It is the very opposite of saying, `I know
    all about it, I've already found it.' As far as I am concerned,
    the word means, `I am looking, I am hunting for it, I am deeply
    involved.'</p>

    <p>I have ears, Theo - if somebody says, `You have a vicious
    character,' what am I supposed to do? I turned away and went
    home alone, but with a very heavy heart that Mauve should have
    been prepared to say that to me. I shall not ask him for an
    explanation, nor shall I apologize.</p>

    <p>And yet - and yet - and yet. I wish Mauve did feel some
    compunction. I am suspected of something&hellip;it is in the
    air&hellip;I am keeping something back, Vincent is concealing
    something that mustn't see the light of day.</p>

    <p>Well, gentlemen, I shall say to you, you people who prize
    manners and culture, and rightly so, provided it is the genuine
    article - which is more cultured, more sensitive, more manly:
    to desert a woman or to concern oneself with one who has been
    deserted?</p>

    <p>Last winter I met a pregnant woman, deserted by the man
    whose child she was carrying. A pregnant woman who walked the
    streets in the winter - she had her bread to earn, you'll know
    how. I took that woman on as a model and have worked with her
    all winter. I couldn't pay her a model's full daily wages, but
    I paid her rent all the same, and thus far, thank God, I have
    been able to save her and her child from hunger and cold by
    sharing my own bread with her.</p>

    <p>When I first came across this woman, she caught my eye
    because she looked so ill. I made her take baths and as many
    restoratives as I could manage, and she has become much
    healthier. I have been with her to Leyden, where there is a
    maternity hospital in which she will be confined.*</p>

    <p>It strikes me that any man worth his salt would have done
    the same in a case like this. I consider what I did so simple
    and natural that I thought I could keep it to myself. She found
    posing difficult, yet she has learned, and I have made progress
    with my drawing because I have had a good model. The woman is
    now attached to me like a tame dove. For my part, I can only
    get married once, and when better than now, and to her, because
    it is the only way to go on helping her and she would otherwise
    be sent back by want on to the same old path which leads to the
    abyss. She has no money, but she is helping me to earn money
    with my work.</p>

    <p>I am filled with zest and ambition for my job and my work,
    and the reason why I have put aside paintings and watercolours
    for a time is that Mauve's desertion gave me a great shock, and
    if he sincerely retracted I should start again with renewed
    courage.</p>

    <p>At the moment I cannot look at a brush, it makes me
    nervous.</p>

    <p>I wrote: Theo, can you enlighten me about Mauve's attitude?
    - perhaps this letter will help to enlighten you in turn. You
    are my brother, it is only natural that I should speak to you
    about private matters, but the moment someone tells me, `You
    have a vicious character,' I don't feel like talking to him any
    more.</p>

    <p>I could not do otherwise, I did what was ready to hand, I
    worked. I thought I would be understood without words. To be
    sure I thought of another woman for whom my heart was beating -
    but she was far away and did not want to see me, and this one -
    there she was, walking about sick, pregnant and hungry - in
    winter. I could not do otherwise. Mauve, Theo, Tersteeg, you
    people have my livelihood in your hands, are you going to
    reduce me to beggary, turn your backs on me? Now I have spoken
    and wait for whatever else will be said to me.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I am sending you a few studies because you may perhaps see
    from them that she has helped me considerably with her posing.
    My drawings are `by my model and me,' <art id=1009a>the one with the white
    bonnet is her mother</art>. But since in a year's
    time, when I shall probably be working quite differently, I
    shall have to base my work on these studies, which I am doing
    now as conscientiously as I can, I should like to have at least
    these three back.</p>

    <p>You can see that they are done with care. If I need an
    interior or a waiting room or something of the kind later on,
    they will prove useful, because I shall be able to look to them
    for the details. But I thought it would perhaps be a good idea
    to keep you up to date on how I spend my time. These studies
    demand a rather dry technique. Had I tried for effect they
    would have been less useful to me later. But I'm sure you will
    see this for yourself.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">The paper I should really like best is that on which the
    <art id=935>female figure bending forward</art> is drawn<art id=937>, </art>
    but if possible the colour of unbleached linen. I
    don't have any of it left <i>in that thickness</i>. I believe
    they call it <i>double</i> Ingres. I can't get any more of it
    here.</label> When you see how that drawing is done, you'll understand
    that the thin stuff is hardly able to take it. I wanted to send
    you a small figure in black merino as well, but I can't roll
    it. The chair near <art id=932>the large figure isn't finished, because I
    want an old oak chair there</art>.</p>

    <p>* Small wonder she wasn't well, the child was in the wrong
    position and she needed an operation, that is, the child had to
    be turned round with forceps. But there is a good chance that
    she will pull through. <i>She is due to give birth in
    June</i>.</p>
