  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>I just received your letter, and it is exactly what I meant.
    Now I am somewhat informed about things, and as the opportunity
    occurs I can try to find something to complete your
    collection.</p>

    <p>In the first place, That Beautiful Wretch - I do <i>not</i>
    have it; it is certainly very beautiful, and I am most eager to
    have it, if possible. I shall send you the Holiday No.82, in
    which there are also very fine illustrations by Caton
    Woodville, Knowles, etc., today or tomorrow, and the following
    sheets besides:</p>

    <p>You happen to have two or three Frank Hols that I don't
    have, but how beautiful the one of the two fellows in the wagon
    is, and so is that other one, and &ldquo;Bereaved&rdquo; too. I
    know them very well.</p>

    <p>I think the one I am sending you completes the series
    &ldquo;Summoned for Active Service,&rdquo; as it is called
    &ldquo;Home Again.&rdquo; I haven't got those sheets by Hopkins
    that you have, but I have others (&ldquo;Fancy Ball&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;Charity&rdquo;).</p>

    <p>I am particularly interested in Buckmann's &ldquo;Vor dem
    Asylhause&rdquo; [In Front of the Night Shelter] - is this one
    from a current magazine? Please let me know; then I shall order
    it. I don't know what this one is like, but I know his work and
    think it splendid - I presume his conception of this subject
    will be unusually beautiful. I don't know Herkomer's
    &ldquo;Schwierigkeiten&rdquo; [Difficulties], nor do I know
    Overend's &ldquo;Gottesdienst&rdquo; [Divine Service] and
    &ldquo;North Pole,&rdquo; nor the things by Main,
    R&eacute;gamey and Boulanger on the last list you sent me. If
    the &ldquo;Boat Race&rdquo; whose artist you don't know has a
    part of a boat with a lady in black, a lady in white and a dog
    in the foreground, then it is by no less a man than <i>Paul</i>
    <i>Renouard</i>.</p>

    <p>I also have a magnificent thing by Dagnan for you, &ldquo;Un
    Charmeur au Jardin des Tuileries,&rdquo; and one by Montbard,
    &ldquo;Arab Beggars.&rdquo; These two had some tears which I
    have repaired, after which I mounted them; they are both very
    large, so I will not send them now, for the package would get
    too big if I sent them flat, and they can no longer be folded.
    You can take them with you whenever you come here, the way you
    did last summer.</p>

    <p>But maybe you have them already, since they are French; in
    that case I shall keep them. They are undamaged now and
    especially beautiful. Let me know if you don't have them; then
    I shall set them apart for you. I have been thinking over your
    scruples about accepting the ones I sent you; and, although I
    respect your feelings, I believe you must not consider it a
    kindness on my part but look upon it as something natural - for
    the following reason.</p>

    <p>I hope you do not object to my considering you my friend,
    and I suppose that you on your part think of me in the same
    way. I feel sure you will agree with me when I say that I think
    friendship must be primarily <i>action</i> and not just
    <i>feeling</i><i>.</i> Consequently it was only natural for me
    to save duplicates for you of things you didn't have yet. You
    yourself did me a similar favour in Brussels, for instance, by
    letting me use your studio when I didn't have one of my own
    yet, and so on.</p>

    <p>You write that you have seven &ldquo;Months&rdquo; by
    Montbard; if I knew which ones they were, I might be able to
    complete them. I see that I have two more beautiful Standards,
    which I shall add to the lot, as well as a Dollmann.</p>

    <p>I should have to see the monogram FD, or whatever it is
    before I could decipher it, which I would do by studying the
    manner in which it is done. I should not be surprised if it
    were F. Dadd. I have also not been able to decipher the
    monogram under &ldquo;The Arrival of the Coach&rdquo;; I have
    found another sketch from Scotland, however, on which it occurs
    too - &ldquo;Salmon Fishers.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Caton Woodville is enormously clever - I see it more and
    more clearly. I have a number of large things by him from
    Ireland; except for &ldquo;Nightly Visit,&rdquo; which you have
    too, they form a series together with other sheets by O'Kelly,
    Gregory and Dadd.</p>

    <p>Well, today I went to visit the place where the dustmen dump
    the garbage, etc. Lord, how beautiful that is - for Buckmann,
    for instance. Tomorrow I shall get some interesting objects
    from this Refuse Dump - including some broken street lamps -
    rusted and twisted - on view - or to pose for me, if you like
    the expression better. The dustman will bring them around. That
    collection of discarded buckets, baskets, kettles, soldiers'
    mess kettles, oil cans, iron wire, street lamps, stovepipes was
    something out of a fairy tale by Andersen.</p>

    <p>I shall probably dream of it tonight, but you may be sure I
    shall work on it this winter. Whenever you come to The Hague, I
    shall be greatly pleased if you will allow me to take you to
    this and some other spots, which, though they are commonplace
    in the extreme, are really an artist's paradise.</p>

    <p>And now a drawing has been waiting for me for quite a while;
    I must now return to it without delay. So you will receive some
    more sheets one of these days. And if you should have
    duplicates, you know I should very much like to have them.</p>

    <p>Adieu - may your work prosper - don't you think the weather
    glorious these days - a real &ldquo;chill October&rdquo;? How
    beautiful the mud is, and the withering grass!</p>

    <p>With a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>You would find a great many things changed in my studio
    since this summer - it is more spacious and convenient, and I
    hope my work will not be any the worse for it.</p>

    <p>Three guilders fifty is perhaps not exorbitant for a volume
    of the London News<i>,</i> provided it is an interesting old
    one, with a lot of things in it, but it all depends on the
    contents, of course.</p>

    <p>Do you remember the &eacute;tablissements de bouillon [soup
    kitchens] in Brussels? One of Roger's was opened that winter
    near the H&ocirc;tel de ville [city hall]; and I saw
    &ldquo;bouillon&rdquo; being given away gratis to poor people
    the morning of the opening. I suddenly remembered it the other
    day, and this is the drawing I am working on at present. I have
    had models here from the Geest, a street which I think greatly
    resembles the Rue Haute or the Rue Blaes in the Walloon Quarter
    of Brussels, for instance. And what I am seeking is most
    certainly the right types, but above all the sentiment of the
    whole. Such a bouillon-gratuit establishment may be in Brussels
    or London or The Hague; its character is sure to be something
    like that of Buckmann's &ldquo;Vor dem Asylhause.&rdquo; The
    figure I made a little scratch of in my previous letter is one
    of the models for it.</p>

    <p><i>What is Wyllie: &ldquo;Funeral of the Late
    Napoleon&rdquo;</i>?</p>

    <p>[The text after the signature is rather odd, chronologically
    speaking. While the date of the body of the letter can be
    safely attributed to October 1882, the facts in the second part
    are more fitted to February - March 1883. The text starting
    &ldquo;Do you remember...&rdquo; is on a separate sheet of
    paper, and it impossible to tell if it belongs to a different
    letter. The &ldquo;figure I made a little scratch of&rdquo;
    could be the sketch enclosed in letter R 14, Orphan Man seen
    from Behind, JH 214]</p>
