  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>A few days ago I received a letter from Rappard, with whom I
    have been corresponding about the experiments in lithography,
    and who is also making some experiments himself.</p>

    <p>I had incidentally written him, &ldquo;I have had another
    obstacle, a letter with money which was especially intended for
    the experiments got lost.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>In answer to this, he wrote: &ldquo;Don't let this trouble
    you, and count on me if you cannot continue or if you need
    something.&rdquo; I had not written it to him because I
    expected him to say such a thing, but because I wanted him, for
    his part, to make a few more experiments. Still, it pleased me,
    because such proofs of sympathy are rare. I answered him, For
    the moment there is no need of it, but if it really became a
    question of my not being able to continue, I would accept your
    aid. And I told him how much I appreciated it. You see now that
    this is one of the cases which I wrote you about in my last
    letter.</p>

    <p>Of course the drawing, the stone, the printing, the paper,
    cause expenses, but, relatively speaking, they are small.
    Sheets such as <art id=1662>the last one I sent you,</art> for instance, as well
    as <art id=1663>a new one I finished last night</art> and which is ready, would, I
    think, be perfectly suitable for a popular publication, which
    is so very, very necessary, here in Holland even more than
    anywhere else.</p>

    <p>Now, an enterprise such as the drawing and printing of a
    series of, for instance, thirty sheets of workmen types - a
    sower, a digger, a woodcutter, a ploughman, a washerwoman, then
    also a child's cradle or a man from the almshouse - well, the
    whole immeasurable field lies open, there are plenty of
    beautiful subjects - can one undertake it or not? The question
    goes even deeper: it is a duty, and is it right or is it wrong?
    That's the question.</p>

    <p>If I were a man of means, I shouldn't hesitate to decide, I
    should say, &ldquo;En avant et plus vite que &ccedil;a. [Quick
    march, and hurry up.]</p>

    <p>But here it is different - may one, must one, can one
    involve and carry along others whom one needs, without whom one
    cannot accomplish it, in an enterprise doubtful of success? I
    wouldn't spare myself. By helping me, you have shown that you
    do not spare yourself either. But others think it both wrong
    and foolish of you to have anything to do with me, and they
    think my own actions even more foolish; and many who at first
    were full of good will changed their opinion, and their courage
    and enthusiasm were as short-lived as a straw-fire.</p>

    <p>In my opinion they are indeed quite wrong, for neither you
    nor I act foolishly in this matter. The whole thing started a
    short time ago with a word from you, &ldquo;I met Buhot, who
    knows a certain way of lithographing which I will tell you more
    about later; you ought to make some experiments with the paper
    he is going to send you.&rdquo; This matter, with its
    relatively insignificant beginning at first, has in a short
    time assumed more important proportions to me.</p>

    <p>I see that with persistence and perseverance it might become
    something not at all unnecessary, but definitely good and
    useful.</p>

    <p>It has always been said that in Holland we cannot make
    prints for the people - I have never been able to believe it, I
    see now that it <i>can</i> be done</p>

    <p>The Society for General Welfare has bolstered up Elsevier in
    Rotterdam with thousands of guilders for the publication of<i> The
    Swallow.</i> Did The Swallow become a good thing?
    <i>No</i>, though it had a few beautiful sheets, it was
    too uninteresting, not serious, not powerful, not strong
    enough; an imitation of what the English do, not original
    enough.</p>

    <p>There are two systems: How not to do it and How to do it.
    How not to do it was, I'm afraid, Elsevier's underlying motive,
    otherwise he <i>would have done</i> it, even if he had had to
    pay for it himself. How-not-to-do-it argues thus: The Society
    gave me so and so much; I get so and so much from the sale; I
    must have so and so much of this <i>for my own
    pocket</i>. I must follow my colleagues' custom,
    otherwise they will call me a mauvais coucheur or a
    spoil-sport, etc.</p>

    <p>So, instead of saying what was written under a picture by
    Millais,<sup>1</sup> "<i>It might be done, and if so, we should
    do it</i>," Elsevier and thousands like him say it can't be
    done, or they do it sloppily and without enough energy. I do
    not know the publishers of The Swallow well enough to be able
    to say exactly whose fault it is; however, I know their
    magazine well enough to take it upon myself to say, "You have
    not made it what it might have been, it should and might have
    been better."</p>

    <p>And in addition to this I say, whatever the case may be now,
    at all times there have been clever, true, brave, honest
    Dutchmen - even during times when everything was generally
    slack and enervated and wrong, the fire was found burning here
    and there in some hidden corner. How much more so during those
    periods when the Dutch people were ranked among the first and
    best.</p>

    <p>So what is needed is courage and self-sacrifice and risking
    something, not for gain, but because it is useful and good; one
    must retain one's trust in one's fellow creatures and fellow
    countrymen in general.</p>

    <p>Before I go further, however, I want to state this: I
    personally will have nothing to do with this business of prints
    for the people, except for making them if such a thing is
    undertaken. It must be a public service, not a publishing
    venture. However, as it is necessary to come into some contact
    with the "book trade," if only about the printing or such,
    for once I speak to you about it, not to ask, "Do you think it
    would be a success?&rdquo; from their point of view, but only
    to discuss, how to do it.</p>

    <p>I should think the following would be the best way:</p>

    <p>As it is useful and necessary that Dutch drawings be made,
    printed and distributed which are destined for workmen's houses
    and for farms, in a word, for every working man, a number of
    persons should unite in order to use their full strength toward
    this end.</p>

    <p>This combination must try to operate as practically and well
    as possible, and should not disperse before the work is
    finished.</p>

    <p>The price of the prints must not be more than ten, at the
    most fifteen cents.</p>

    <p>The publication should start when a series of thirty sheets
    has been made and printed and when the expenses for stones,
    wages and paper have been paid</p>

    <p>Those thirty sheets would be published together, but could
    be bought separately; they would form a whole in a linen cover
    with a short text, not referring to the drawings - which speak
    for themselves - but explaining in a few concise, vigorous
    words how and why they are made, etc.</p>

    <p>The reason for this combination is the following. If the
    draughtsmen undertook it alone, they would be saddled with
    everything, the work as well as the expenses, and the
    undertaking would be a failure before it was half finished.
    Therefore the burden must be equally divided, so that everyone
    has his share to carry and the thing can be brought off.</p>

    <p>The profits from the sale would serve first to pay back the
    money to those who furnished it, and second, to pay each
    draughtsman an equal amount to be fixed later.</p>

    <p>Once these things have been settled, the rest would be used
    for new publications to continue the work.</p>

    <p>Those who begin this work will consider it a duty.
    Self-interest <i>not</i> being their aim, if the undertaking
    doesn't pay, and the deposits are lost, neither the
    money-lenders nor the draughtsmen nor anyone who might have
    contributed may retrieve what they have put into it; neither
    may they claim more than they furnished if the undertaking
    should succeed beyond all expectation.</p>

    <p>In the latter case, the surplus would be used for the
    continuation of the work; in the former case, the original
    group would keep the stones, from which at all events the first
    700 copies would be reserved not for thc combination but for
    the public: if the combination fails, those copies must be
    spread free of charge. Immediately after the publication of the
    first series of thirty, a consultation must be held, and it
    must be decided whether to continue or not; and then, but not
    before, whoever wants to withdraw from the combination may do
    so.</p>

    <p>This is the idea I've formulated, and now I am telling you
    how to do it. Will you join?</p>

    <p>I haven't spoken to others about it because the idea only
    became clear to me while at work. But I have already been
    discussing the question of prints for the people for a long
    time with Rappard, with the result that both he and I are
    interested in it; so that, as I already told you, he
    voluntarily said to me, I will give you a helping hand.</p>

    <p>However, Rappard does not view the matter as I wish he would
    - that is, he doesn't agree with me on questions of technique.
    As to his proposal to lend me money, I resolved to refuse it
    for myself personally, because I should only want it if a
    combination such as the one I wrote you about could not be
    established: then I should try to carry out the idea myself.
    Once as far as that, I should have to see what more I could do.
    For the present I tell him my ideas about the matter, and ask
    him as I do you: couldn't we take such a thing in hand?</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">And for myself, I should wish that in this combination
    everybody should be quite equal, no rules or president or any
    such thing, only a memorandum regulating the matter, which
    could only be changed by a unanimous vote once it had been
    definitely drawn up and signed by the founders; further, the
    names of those who pledged themselves (<i>but these are not to
    be made public, the whole thing being an artistic, a private
    enterprise</i>), listing in what way they are contributing.
    <i>A</i> pledges himself to make this or that, <i>B</i> gives
    so much, etc., that's all.</label></p>

    <p>Meanwhile it is December 1. If you have not written already,
    do so as soon as possible, for I haven't a cent left.</p>

    <p>Adieu, believe me with a warm handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>It ought to be a combination which <i>acts</i>, not
    deliberates, acts quickly and resolutely and without loss of
    time, considering the whole thing a matter of public service,
    not a publisher's speculation.</p>

    <p>Another thing. One must calculate the expenses beforehand;
    thirty stones, printing wages, paper, how much would it be? I
    do not know exactly, but I think that 300 guilders would cover
    a great deal. The drawings would be contributed by members who
    could not give any money. I will take them all upon myself if
    there is nobody else. But I would rather that artists better
    than myself undertook it.</p>

    <p>In any case I think it is desirable to bring the first
    thirty sheets before the public, and I should like to see this
    through, even if for the present no other contributors should
    present themselves to make the drawings. Because artists who
    could do it better than I may hope to might perhaps be induced
    to join if they were shown the series. Many people will begin
    only when they know for sure that the undertaking is serious,
    and will refuse to have anything to do with it as long as the
    first steps have not been taken.</p>
