    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>The weeks pass quickly and it is Sunday again.</p>

    <p>I have often been to Scheveningen these last few days, and
    one evening I just hit that curious moment when a fishing smack
    was coming in. Near the monument is a little wooden shed in
    which a man sits on the lookout. As soon as the boat came in
    sight, the fellow appeared with a large blue flag, followed by
    a crowd of little children who just reached his knees. It was
    apparently a great pleasure for them to stand near the man with
    the flag, and I suppose they fancied they were helping the
    fishing smack come in. A few minutes after the man had waved
    his flag, a fellow on an old horse arrived who had to go and
    get the anchor.</p>

    <p>Then the group was joined by several men and women -
    including mothers with children - to welcome the crew. When the
    boat was near enough, the man on horseback went into the water
    and came back with the anchor.</p>

    <p>Then the men were carried ashore on the backs of men wearing
    high wading boots, and there was a great cheer of welcome at
    each new arrival. When they were all ashore, the whole troop
    marched home like a flock of sheep or like a caravan, with the
    man on the camel - I mean the man on the horse - towering over
    them like a tall spectre.</p>

    <p>Of course I tried to sketch the various incidents most
    carefully. I have also painted part of it, namely, the group of
    which I enclose a little sketch.</p>

    <p>Then I painted another study of a marine, nothing but a bit
    of sand, sea, sky - grey and lonely. I sometimes long for that
    quiet, where there is nothing but the gray sea - with a
    solitary sea bird - except for that, no voice other than the
    roaring of the waves. It is a refreshing change from the noisy
    bustle of the Geest or the potato market.</p>

    <p>For the rest, this week I have been working on sketches for
    watercolours.</p>

    <p>I also carried the <art id=951>large one of the bench out further</art>,
    and then I made a sketch of women in the hospital
    garden, and part of the Geest.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">You can see from the enclosed sketch what I want to make -
    groups of people who are in action some way or another. But how
    difficult it is to bring life and movement into it and to put
    the figures in their places, yet separate from each other. It
    is that great problem, <i>moutonner</i>: groups of
    figures form one whole, but in it the head or shoulders of one
    rise above those of another; in the foreground the legs of the
    first figures standout strongly, and somewhat higher the skirts
    and trousers form a kind of confusion in which the lines are
    still quite visible. </label>Then to the right or the left, according
    to the point of view, the greater or lesser extension or
    shortening of the sides. As to composition, all possible scenes
    with figures - either a market or the arrival of a boat, a
    group of people in line at the soup kitchen, in the waiting
    room of the station, the hospital, the pawnshop... groups
    talking in the street or walking around - are based on that
    same principle of the flock of sheep, from which the word
    <i>moutonner</i> is surely derived, and it all depends on the
    same problems of light and brown and perspective. There is the
    same effect of the chestnut trees here as you describe in your
    last letter, as you will have seen from the drawing of the
    little bench; only here very little of the new green leaves is
    still visible, though some time ago I also noticed it, but here
    they are withered by the many gales.</p>

    <p>Soon the leaves will really start to fall here, and then
    especially I hope to paint many studies of the wood and also of
    the beach, for though there are no effects of autumn leaves
    there, the peculiar light of autumn evenings has its own
    effect, and it is twice as beautiful there during this time of
    the year, as it is everywhere.</p>

    <p>Am rather short of colours and other things, but you know
    how it is - I can vary my work in different ways, and there are
    always so many things to draw. For the group of figures in the
    enclosed sketch varies infinitely and requires innumerable
    separate studies and sketches of each figure, which one must
    catch quickly in the street. In this way it gradually gets
    character and vigour. Recently I made <art id=980>a study of ladies and
    gentlemen on the beach, a hustling crowd of people</art>.</p>

    <p>Sooner or later, after some more study, I should love to do
    drawings for illustrations. Perhaps one thing will result from
    the other. The main thing is to continue working.</p>

    <p>I certainly hope you are well, and that you will write me
    about yourself and the things which strike you in your
    surroundings. Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>I am so afraid that you are in great embarrassment because
    of the occurrence you wrote me about, and I hope things will
    settle themselves.</p>

    <p>You see from the little sketch that I have started the thing
    I mentioned in my last letter, namely, regularly sketching the
    scenes of working people, of fishermen, which strike me -
    either drawing or painting them; and these are the very things
    which, with some practice, might serve as illustrations, I
    think.</p>

    <p>Of course the characters must be much more vigorously
    executed for that purpose.</p>

    <p>I made about ten different sketches of the fishing smack's
    arrival, also of the weighing of the anchor which I sent you in
    my last letter.</p>
