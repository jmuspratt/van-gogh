    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Today I sent you a drawing, &ldquo;Vegetable Gardens on the
    Laan van Meerdervoort.&rdquo;[Drawing lost]</p>

    <p>So now you have one of my figures and one of my landscapes,
    and I think you will see that I have made some progress.</p>

    <p>Though this be &ldquo;only black and white&rdquo; and
    unsaleable??? and without charm??? I still hope there may be
    some character in it. And I think that instead of reproaching
    me for applying myself only to drawing things, this certainly
    proves that I am taking the most practical way. For it is
    easier to proceed from drawing to painting than, conversely, to
    make pictures without drawing the necessary studies.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.loneliness">Of course it causes me a great deal of worry and makes my
    life far from easy when those whom I thought I could depend on
    for sympathy, like Mauve and Tersteeg, become indifferent or
    hostile and spiteful. I have not heard anything from Mauve; one
    day he is ill, and then again he needs rest, or he is too busy.</label>
    How beautiful his picture for the Salon is!</p>

    <p>But you understand these things yourself, so enough.</p>

    <p>This little drawing also needs a narrow grey mount. You
    write that you have moved; I will do my best to make something
    for the walls of your new home now and then. I also have a few
    good wood engravings you could perhaps use if you like them, as
    I have duplicates of some good ones. But you must see and
    choose those for yourself when you come this summer.</p>

    <p>I have not moved, but I have had an alteration made in my
    house, that is, I have had a little bedroom partitioned off in
    the attic; now I have more room in the studio, especially as
    the stove has been removed.</p>

    <p>You see, there are a great many things in drawing which lots
    of people often overlook. There is the correct perspective of
    an interior, for instance (I will send you a specimen of that
    too, someday); there are the great lines of a landscape; and
    then I personally see no way to eliminate study of the
    nude.</p>

    <p>All this is essentially <i>drawing</i> - once having fairly
    mastered this, one sees the way out; and I personally go
    quietly along this way, knowing that if only I persist, before
    long I shall overtake a few of those who think they can skip
    such things.</p>

    <p>All good luck to you. The weather is very cold and windy
    here, and it worries me a great deal, as I cannot go on with
    the views of the city for C. M., which I would otherwise make
    between times; but surely the mild weather will come again.</p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>This little drawing has caused me more trouble than has been
    expended on many a watercolour. I send it to the Bd.
    Montmartre<sup>1</sup> because then you can have it pressed and
    mounted at once.</p>
