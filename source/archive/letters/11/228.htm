  <body>
    <p>Sunday morning</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just received your very welcome letter, and as am
    taking some rest today, I am answering it at once. Thank you
    very much for it and for the enclosure, and for the various
    things you say in it.</p>

    <p>And many thanks for your description of that scene with the
    workmen at Montmartre, which I found very interesting because
    you convey the colours so well that I can see them. I am glad
    you are reading the book on Gavarni. I found it very
    interesting, and it made me love G. twice as much.</p>

    <p>Paris and its environs may be beautiful, but we have no
    complaints here either.</p>

    <p>This week I did a painting that I think would remind you a
    little of Scheveningen as we saw it when we walked there
    together: A large study of sand, sea and sky - a big sky of
    delicate grey and warm white, with a single small patch of soft
    blue shimmering through - the sand and the sea light, so that
    the whole becomes golden, but animated by the boldly and
    distinctively coloured figures and fishing smacks, which tend
    to set the tonal values. The subject of the sketch I made of it
    is a fishing smack weighing anchor. The horses stand ready for
    hitching up before pulling the smack into the sea. I am
    enclosing a little sketch of it.</p>

    <p>It was really hard to do. I just wish I'd painted it on a
    panel or on canvas. I tried to get more colour into it, that
    is, depth, strength of colour.</p>

    <p>How strange it is that you and I so often seem to have the
    same thoughts. Yesterday evening, for instance, I came home
    from the woods with a study, having been deeply preoccupied
    with the question of depth of colour the whole week, and
    particularly at that moment. And I should very much have liked
    to have talked to you about it, especially with reference to
    the study I had done - and lo and behold, in this morning's
    letter you chance to mention that you were struck by the very
    vivid, yet harmonious, colours of Montmartre. I don't know if
    it was precisely the same thing that struck the two of us, but
    I do know that you would most certainly have been affected by
    what struck me so particularly and would probably have seen it
    in the same light.</p>

    <p>As a start, I am sending you a little sketch of the subject
    and I shall tell you what the problem was.</p>

    <p>The woods are becoming thoroughly autumnal, and there are
    colourful effects I don't often see in Dutch paintings.</p>

    <p>Yesterday evening I was working on a slightly rising
    woodland slope covered with dry and mouldering beech leaves [F
    008, JH 182]. The ground was light and dark reddish brown,
    emphasized by the weaker and stronger shadows of trees casting
    half-obliterated stripes across it. The problem, and I found it
    a very difficult one, was to get the depth of colour, the
    enormous power and solidity of that ground - and yet it was
    only while painting it that I noticed how much light there was
    still in the dusk - to retain the light as well as the glow,
    and depth of that rich colour, for there is no carpet
    imaginable as splendid as that deep brownish-red in the glow of
    an autumn evening sun, however toned down by the trees.</p>

    <p>Young beech trees spring from the ground, catching the light
    to one side, where they are a brilliant green, and the shadowy
    side of the trunks is a warm, intense black-green.</p>

    <p>Behind those saplings, behind that brownish-red ground, is a
    sky of a very delicate, blue-grey. Warm, hardly blue at all,
    sparkling. And against it there is a hazy border of greenness
    and a network of saplings and yellowish leaves. A few figures
    of wood gatherers are foraging about, dark masses of mysterious
    shadows. The white cap of a woman bending down to pick up a dry
    branch stands out suddenly against the deep reddish-brown of
    the ground. A skirt catches the light, a shadow is cast, the
    dark silhouette of a man appears above the wooded slope. A
    white bonnet, a cap, a shoulder, the bust of a woman show up
    against the sky. These figures, which are large and full of
    poetry, appear in the twilight of that deep shadowy tone like
    enormous clay figurines taking shaped in a studio.</p>

    <p>I am describing nature to you - I'm not sure to what extent
    I reproduced it in my sketch, but I do know that I was struck
    by the harmony of green, red, black, yellow, blue, brown, grey.
    It was very de Groux-like, an effect like, say, that sketch of
    &ldquo;The Conscript's Departure&rdquo; formerly in the Palais
    Ducal.</p>

    <p>It was a hard job painting it. The ground used up one and a
    half large tubes of white - even though the ground is very dark
    - and for the rest red, yellow, brown, ochre, black, sienna,
    bistre, and the result is a reddish-brown, but one ranging from
    bistre to deep wine-red and to a pale, golden ruddiness. Then
    there are still the mosses and a border of fresh grass, which
    catches the light and glitters brightly, and is very difficult
    to capture. So there in the end you have it, a sketch that I
    maintain has some significance, something to tell, no matter
    what may be said about it.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">I said to myself while I was doing it: don't let me leave
    before there is something of the autumnal evening in it,
    something mysterious, something important. However - because
    this effect doesn't last - I had to paint quickly, putting the
    figures in all at once, with a few forceful strokes of a firm
    brush. It had struck me how firmly the saplings were rooted in
    the ground - I started on them with the brush, but because the
    ground was already impasted, brush-strokes simply vanished into
    it. Then I squeezed the roots and trunks in from the tube and
    modelled them a little with the brush.</label></p>

    <p>Well, they are in there now, springing out of it, standing
    strongly rooted in it.</p>

    <p>In a way I am glad that I never <i>learned</i> painting. In
    all probability I would then have learned to ignore such
    effects as this. Now I can say to myself, this is just what I
    want. If it is impossible, it is impossible, but I'm going to
    try it even though I don't know how it ought to be done. <i>I
    don't know myself</i> how I paint it, I just sit down with a
    white board in front of the spot that appeals to me, I look at
    what is in front of my eyes, and I say to myself: that white
    board has got to turn into something - I come back,
    dissatisfied, I lay it to one side and when I have rested a
    little, I go and look at it with a kind of awe. Then I am still
    dissatisfied, because I have that splendid scenery too much in
    my mind to be satisfied with what I made of it. Yet I can see
    in my work an echo of what appealed to me, I can see that the
    scenery has told me something, has spoken to me, and that I
    have taken it down in shorthand. My shorthand may contain words
    that cannot be deciphered, mistakes or gaps, and yet there is
    something left of what the wood or the beach or the figure has
    told me, and it isn't in tame or conventional language derived
    from a studied manner or from some system, but from nature
    itself.</p>

    <p>Enclosed another little sketch from the dunes. There are
    small bushes there whose leaves are white on one side and dark
    green on the other and are constantly moving and glittering.
    Beyond them dark trees.</p>

    <p>You can see that I am plunging full speed ahead into
    painting, I am plunging into colour. I have refrained from
    doing so up till now and I am not sorry for it. Had I had not
    already done some drawing, I should be unable to get the
    feeling of, or be able to tackle, a figure that looks like an
    unfinished clay figurine. But now that I sense I have gained
    the open sea, painting must go full speed ahead as fast as we
    are able.</p>

    <p>If I am going to paint on panel or canvas then the expenses
    will go up again, everything is so expensive, paint is
    expensive, too, and is so quickly used up. Well, these are
    complaints all painters have, we must see what can be done. I
    know for certain that I have a feeling for colour and shall
    acquire more and more, that painting is in the very marrow of
    my bones.</p>

    <p>I value your loyal and effective help more than I can say. I
    think of you so much; I should so like my work to become
    vigorous, serious, virile, so that you too may get some
    pleasure out of it as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>One thing I should like to bring to your attention as a
    matter of importance - wouldn't it be possible to obtain paint,
    panels, brushes, etc., at <i>discount</i> prices? I am having
    to pay the <i>retail</i> price at the moment. Have you any
    connection with Paillard or someone like that? If so, I think
    it would be much more economical to get paints, say, wholesale,
    for instance white, ochre, sienna, and we could then come to
    some arrangement about the money. Everything would be cheaper,
    it goes without saying. Do think it over.</p>

    <p>One doesn't paint well by using a lot of paint, but in order
    to do a ground effectively or to get a sky bright, one must
    sometimes not spare the tube. Sometimes the subject calls for
    less paint, sometimes the material, the nature of the subjects
    themselves demands impasto. Mauve, who paints very frugally in
    comparison with J. Maris and even more so in comparison with
    Millet or Jules Dupr&eacute;, nevertheless has cigar boxes full
    of the remnants of tubes in the corners of his studio, as
    plentiful as the empty bottles in the corners of rooms after a
    soir&eacute;e or dinner such as Zola describes, for
    instance.</p>

    <p>Well, if there could be a little extra this month, that
    would be wonderful. If not, then not. I shall work as hard as I
    can. <label content="health.general">You ask about my health, but what about yours? I would
    imagine my remedy would be yours as well: to be out in the
    open, painting. I am well, I still feel like it even when I'm
    tired, and that is getting better rather than worse. It's also
    a good thing, I think, that I live as frugally as possible, but
    my main remedy is painting.</label></p>

    <p>I sincerely hope that your luck is in and that you will have
    even more. Please accept a handshake in my thoughts, and
    believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>You will see that there is a soft, golden effect in the
    little marine sketch and a more sombre, more serious mood in
    the woods. I am glad that both exist in life.</p>
