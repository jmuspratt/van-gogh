  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Just a word to ask you whether you have received my last
    letter as well as a little roll, also sent by mail, containing
    <art id=1658>a proof of a lithograph</art>.</p>

    <p>The reason why I can't help suspecting that it didn't reach
    you but got lost, or that the letter got lost, is that I
    haven't heard from you since then; and besides, today is
    already November 14. For the last five or six days I have been
    literally without money, and consequently I cannot go on with
    my work, at least not as I should wish.</p>

    <p>I think the reason is that you want to send me, along with
    your letter and the money, the information I asked you for
    about the lithographic process and the autographic ink, and
    that you had to wait for it. And I hope that perhaps today it
    will be explained this way.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.apprehension">But on the other hand,
    I'm always nervous when something
    like this happens and I feel anxious, and then I am afraid of
    having written or done something which you do not approve of.
    So last night I worried about it: perhaps you didn't approve of
    my having had my lithograph printed; perhaps you would conclude
    from my letter that I intended to publish my work, or something
    like that. Well, I was anxious, thinking something had
    happened. But probably nothing is wrong. For safety's sake,
    however, I will tell you that you must not confuse publications
    with experiments made to learn a process.</label></p>

    <p>The former, namely publications, are things which I would
    certainly not undertake without consulting you, and for the
    present, I do not think of it; and besides, as you know, I only
    busy myself with the drawings and the artistic side of the
    work, that's all. These experiments I make are certainly part
    of this, however, and it is quite natural that I work on
    them.</p>

    <p>Some time ago Rappard, for instance, made similar
    experiments with etchings, which also had to be printed; but
    the printing an artist does is not publishing - it has nothing
    to do with business, being quite a private affair. This seems
    to me as clear as daylight, but, as I told you, last night (as
    I had not received a letter from you) I was worrying about it,
    lest you take it for quite a different kind of action.</p>

    <p>Well, I hope it will soon become apparent that I had no need
    to worry. I hope, on the contrary, that you succeeded in
    getting information about the same matter, namely that you can
    tell me something about the processes.</p>

    <p>On what was left of the printing paper, I made another trial
    last week with the little figure<art id=929> &ldquo;Sorrow.&rdquo;</art> Just now
    when I said that I was afraid you would suspect from my last
    letter something that was not my intention, I was remembering
    that I said something like: &ldquo;This is what I should like:
    to have some of these sheets printed at our own expense, which
    would give us more prestige with the editors of the
    magazines.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Now, my idea is by no means that either you or I should
    handle the business part if we undertook the printing at our
    own expense. I did not and should not think of that for a
    moment. I just think that when one applies for a job, it is
    well to have some work to show. It saves words and is more
    practical.</p>

    <p>I don't think it improbable that some time I shall make
    things which will come into the public's hands, but it leaves
    me rather cold, and I don't consider it a pleasure at all.</p>

    <p>Two reasons would force me to it. In the first place, if I
    became employed by a magazine, then of course I should have to
    do what is required. In the second place - something which may
    come later, but which I have certainly thought about already -
    if sooner or later I should have something which forms a whole
    and has a purpose and expresses something, I would certainly
    publish it; but never without consulting you or letting you
    know, and only if I could not find anyone else to do it for
    me.</p>

    <p>Such a thing would probably cost me money rather than bring
    money in; it would be for art's sake, not primarily for profit.
    If I ever did it, I should let you know everything, and in no
    respect, neither as to the work nor as to the publication,
    would it be dishonest - otherwise, of course, I would never do
    it.</p>

    <p>So, if there were anything that you might consider as my
    undertaking a step toward publication (I don't suppose there
    is, but in my nervousness, as I could find no other reason, I
    thought of that sentence in my letter), rest assured that this
    means nothing more than experiments which anyone who etches or
    lithographs, or reproduces his drawings in some way or another,
    <i>must</i> make in order to learn the process and the effect
    of black and white. If some sheet or other succeeds and the
    maker prints a certain number of copies, it would be - at least
    for me, and for most artists who do such a thing - something of
    an absolutely artistic nature, without any relation to
    commercial publication. If I didn't know from experience that
    misunderstandings may arise about matters such as showing
    drawings (and showing printed copies is similar), and it is
    often considered presumptuous, it would never have entered my
    head. Now as to the non-arrival of your letter, I must tell you
    that, when I think of all your faithfulness, I am sure it
    probably has nothing to do with this matter, and there must be
    some other reason for it.</p>

    <p>When I used the above-quoted sentence in my last letter,
    what I meant was that someday you will see my intentions more
    clearly in my drawings. In print (because of the lithographic
    crayon) they are all, especially <art id=1655>&ldquo;Sorrow,&rdquo;</art> much
    stronger than in the drawing. And just because the originals
    are kept grey and sober, I have only to follow my study to get
    vigour into my lithograph. And this is something which I should
    have to point out to the people with whom I might get in touch
    if I could get some work for a magazine. Well, if you have not
    written, do so at once when you receive this. For I am rather
    hard up. Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
