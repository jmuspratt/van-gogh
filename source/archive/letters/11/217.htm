    <p>Wednesday</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I cannot tell you how much I regret Tersteeg's untimely
    visit. It is why I am writing about a few things now, although
    I would rather have waited and talked them over with you. I
    have told you that I wanted to marry Sien, and as soon as
    possible. Mind, however, that I wish to talk this over with you
    personally before saying anything to Father. I can get along
    with you better; you feel things more justly than all the
    others put together, and when you say something, it is worth
    while. Even though we do not agree about some things, we can
    always meet each other halfway because we speak in sympathy and
    calmness.</p>

    <p>I also believe that if no one else meddled, unasked,
    everything would come right in all respects. As soon as there
    is any question of marriage, however, people flare up quickly
    and noisily, and there is no arguing with them; you can hardly
    get a word in edgewise. So I shall no longer wait to write
    about what I would rather talk over.</p>

    <p>About marrying, you said, Do not marry her, etc., and you
    thought Sien fooled me, etc.</p>

    <p>I then answered you that I could not agree with you in that,
    etc.</p>

    <p>But I did not want flatly to contradict you, because I
    believed, and still believe, that in time you would grow to
    like Sien if you knew her better; and then of course you would
    no longer think that she fooled me or any such thing. When this
    has been achieved, we can talk about marriage again, I thought.
    But you will also remember that I did not speak openly about it
    in my last letter.</p>

    <p>Only I said this much at the time, there is a promise of
    marriage between her and me, and I do not want you to think of
    her as a mistress or as someone with whom I have a liaison
    without caring about the consequences.</p>

    <p>Now I shall come back to it once more. That promise of
    marriage is twofold; first, a promise of civil marriage as soon
    as circumstances will permit, and second, a promise to help
    each other meanwhile, to support each other, to cherish each
    other, not letting ourselves be separated by anything. Now the
    civil marriage is probably the most important question to the
    family. Indeed, it is important to her and to me, but it is
    secondary to the real essence of the matter, the love and faith
    between us as it already exists and is growing daily.</p>

    <p>I am ready to propose to you letting the whole question of
    civil marriage rest for an indefinite time and, for instance,
    postponing it until I earn 150 francs a month by selling my
    work, at which time your help will no longer be necessary. With
    you, but only with you, I will thus agree that for the time
    being I shall not enter into a civil marriage, not until my
    drawing has progressed so far that I am independent.</p>

    <p>As I begin to earn, you will gradually send less every
    month; and when I finally do not need your money any longer, we
    can talk about civil marriage again. But until then it would be
    quite absurd, after what has happened all last winter and
    especially these last months, to try to separate or divide us.
    We are bound and knit together by a strong bond of mutual
    affection, and by the help we mutually give each other. For she
    is my partner in work, if I may call her so, and is infinitely
    more than an ordinary model because she poses so willingly and
    intelligently that I cannot praise her enough.</p>

    <p>After all I have told you now, I hope you will look at
    things with more confidence. This winter you heard from
    Heyerdahl, for instance, better things about my work than what
    Tersteeg thinks about it. I now feel so much renewed animation
    for my work that I have high hopes of making some progress this
    autumn. Perhaps about Christmas, when the year I have allowed
    myself is over, I will send you a number of small watercolours,
    of which the last little drawings, which already have some
    touches of brown and red and grey in them, were the beginning.
    And sometimes I feel a great longing to paint too, a very great
    longing and ambition. Especially now that the better light and
    the better studio involuntarily urge me on.<label content="health.fatigue"> The doctor forbids
    my working hard, as I still tire very easily; but this will
    gradually disappear, and then I shall set to work with full
    energy.</label></p>

    <p>I want to reserve to myself the right of discussing with you
    in general the question of marriage, housekeeping expenses,
    etc., when you come here, particularly as I believe there are
    some points on which you are mistaken; but this will be in
    quite a friendly way, and it does not bear directly on the
    question of a legal marriage to Sien. As all this forces me to
    write at once, I only ask that the matter be allowed to rest
    until such time as I earn more by the direct sale of my work.
    When you come here, I shall certainly tell you the reason why I
    should have preferred to marry her without delay, but please do
    not consider this a further insistence on my part. No, to the
    extent I mentioned I am prepared to make concessions as far as
    I told you, of my own accord and of my own free will.</p>

    <p>If people should speak to you about the affair, I think you
    might say that you and I are on sufficiently confidential terms
    to ensure your getting the necessary information from me, but
    that you do not think the matter need be discussed for the time
    being.</p>

    <p>Such interviews like the one with Tersteeg have a more
    aggravating effect on the woman and myself than the rawest
    north wind; they must be avoided. The main thing is to get
    fully recovered, and to be fit to work regularly again.</p>

    <p>I only hope now, Theo, that what I tell you about marrying
    will show you that I do not want to have my own way in
    everything, that I am willing to give in to your wishes as far
    as I can; but then let this prove to you that I deserve your
    confidence and your writing me about various things. I cannot
    get on with the others, but I can talk and settle things with
    you.</p>

    <p>What I want is to save Sien's life and that of her two
    children. I do not want her to fall back into that terrible
    state of illness and misery in which I found her, and from
    which she is saved for the present. This I undertook, this I
    must continue. I do not want her ever to feel again that she is
    deserted and alone. I want her to feel and to know in every way
    that I feel tender love for her and affection for the children.
    And - whoever may disapprove of this - you will understand and
    not try to prevent it. I attribute her recovery to you, as I
    credit myself with only a small part. I have only been the
    means of bringing it about.</p>

    <p>I repeat, I am sorry that I have not been able to tell you
    personally, and after you had made the acquaintance of the
    woman, what I have told you in this letter; then perhaps I
    might have added some more things to make you feel that I am
    not unreasonable. But even now I hope you will come before long
    and that at all events you will write soon.</p>

    <p>Sien will soon be at her ease with you, and then you will
    not look down on her, and think of her the way Tersteeg did
    yesterday.</p>

    <p>Be fully assured of her and my warmest affection, receive a
    handshake in thought and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>What I should like to talk over with you once more is the
    condition in which I found her, and things about her past. The
    poor creature has had a very hard time of it. And yet there is
    still a vitality and delicacy of feeling in her which have not
    been quenched.</p>

    <p>I repeat once more that I am longing so very much for your
    coming, apart from everything, because I so need sympathy and
    affection. I should like so much to walk with you once more,
    though the Rijswijk mill is no longer there. Enfin.</p>
