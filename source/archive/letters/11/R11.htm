    <p>Sunday evening</p>

    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Your letter, which I received last night, gladdened my
    heart. I had been expecting it, but I thought you were on a
    jaunt somewhere. What you say about Drenthe interests me - I do
    not know it at all from my own observation, but I do through
    the things Mauve and ter Meulen, for instance, brought back
    from there.</p>

    <p>I imagine it is something like Brabant <i>when I was
    young</i> - say, some twenty years ago. I remember as a boy
    seeing that heath and the little farms, the looms and the
    spinning wheels in exactly the same way I see them now in
    Mauve's and ter Meulen's drawings. But since then that part of
    Brabant with which I was acquainted has changed enormously in
    consequence of agricultural developments and the establishment
    of industries. Speaking for myself, in certain spots I do not
    look without a little sadness on a new red-tiled tavern,
    remembering a loam cottage with a moss-covered thatched roof
    that used to be there.</p>

    <p>Since then there have come sugar-beet factories, railways,
    agricultural developments of the heath, etc., which are
    infinitely less picturesque.</p>

    <p>It can't be helped - but what is sure to remain is something
    of the stern poetry of the real heath. And this real heath
    seems to exist in Drenthe as it used to in Brabant.</p>

    <p>Yet there is an enormous amount of beautiful scenery in
    Brabant, even now - do you remember 't Heike,<sup>1</sup> where
    we were together?</p>

    <p>I think the little sketches in your letter very good; I find
    much character in that &ldquo;Churchyard&rdquo; especially. As
    for me, in consequence of a visit from my brother, who saw my
    watercolours, I am also very busy painting.</p>

    <p>Speaking frankly, I do not think people would conclude from
    my first painted studies that they really are my first.</p>

    <p>There is nothing strange in it for me, and it greatly
    attracts me.</p>

    <p>Last night I found a very pretty effect in the meadows near
    Rijswijk. Flat green meadows, across which runs a black coal
    path with a ditch alongside. The sun is setting fiery red - a
    poor peasant is trudging home - in the far distance a
    farmhouse. <sup>2</sup></p>

    <p>Further, I have a small marine - and patches of dune soil -
    a row of pollard willows, a potato field and so on.</p>

    <p>Painting is so sympathetic to me that it will be very
    difficult for me not to go on painting
    <i>forever</i>.</p>

    <p>It is more virile than doing watercolours, and there is more
    poetry in it.</p>

    <p>Probably you know that at present there is an exhibition of
    the Hollandse Tekenmaatschappij [&ldquo;Dutch Drawing
    Society&rdquo;] here. There are splendid things</p>

    <p>There is a &ldquo;Woman at a Weaving Loom&rdquo; by Mauve
    that I cannot get out of my mind. A &ldquo;Poor Old
    Woman&rdquo; by Isra&euml;ls, the same. Neuhuys, Maris,
    Duch&acirc;tel [Du Chattel], ter Meulen and a lot of others, to
    say nothing of Weissenbruch!</p>

    <p>There is an extremely nice portrait of Weissenbruch by
    Isra&euml;ls, so true and characteristic that I cannot describe
    it to you.</p>

    <p>There is also a beautiful large marine by Mesdag and two
    Swiss things by him that I think rather silly, although there
    is a certain boldness in them - but not carried through and not
    &ldquo;felt.&rdquo; But I think the large marine superb.</p>

    <p>By Willem Maris, a very striking &ldquo;Sow&rdquo; with a
    legion of piglets.</p>

    <p>And a Jaap [Jacob] Maris, a very large &ldquo;Town
    View,&rdquo; as vigorous as Vermeer of Delft.</p>

    <p>Some time ago we had an exhibition of French art from
    private collections: Daubigny, Corot, Jules Dupr&eacute;, Jules
    Breton, Courbet, Diaz, Jacque, Th. Rousseau; this work
    stimulated me very much - but for all that I felt a certain
    melancholy when I thought how these faithful veterans are
    disappearing one by one. Corot is dead and gone, Th. Rousseau,
    Millet, Daubigny are resting after their labours. Jules Breton,
    Jules Dupr&eacute; Jacque, Ed. Fr&egrave;re are still there,
    but how long will they be going around in their painter's
    smocks? They are all elderly men, with one foot in the grave.
    And their successors - are they worthy of those first truly
    modern masters? All the more reason for us to bestir ourselves
    energetically and not to slacken.</p>

    <p>I am much pleased with my new studio; I can find my subjects
    in the immediate neighborhood. With all my heart I hope you
    will come and see me eventually, and I am always eager to see
    something of your work, or to read about it in a letter.</p>

    <p>My brother also sends you his kind regards; I told him you
    were working so hard. The same is true of me in this respect,
    so that at present I am writing only a few letters, and I am
    writing in great haste now too.</p>

    <p>Good luck and success in everything, and believe me, with a
    handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
