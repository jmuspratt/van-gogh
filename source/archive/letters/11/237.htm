  <body>
    <p>Sunday afternoon</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I don't need to tell you how delighted I was with your
    letter and the enclosure, it comes just in time and will be of
    tremendous help to me.</p>

    <p>We are having autumn weather here, rainy and chilly, but
    full of atmosphere, especially splendid for figures, which
    stand out in tone against the wet streets and roads reflecting
    the sky. It is what Mauve, in particular, does so beautifully
    time and again. So I have been able to do some work on <art id=970>the
    large watercolour of the crowd of people in front of the
    lottery office</art>, and I have also started another
    one of the beach, of which <art id=982>this is the composition</art>.</p>

    </p>

    <p><label content="psychology.depression">I entirely agree with
    what you say about those times now and
    then when one feels dull-witted in the face of nature or when
    nature seems to have stopped speaking to us.</p>

    <p>I get the same feeling quite often and it sometimes helps if
    I then tackle something quite different. When I feel jaded with
    landscape or light effects, I tackle figures, and vice versa.
    Sometimes there is nothing for it but to wait for it to pass,
    but many a time I manage to do away with the numbness by
    changing my subject matter.</label></p>

    <p>However, I am becoming more and more fascinated by the
    figure. I remember there used to be a time when my feeling for
    landscape was very strong and I was much more impressed by a
    painting or drawing which captured a light effect or the
    atmosphere of a landscape than I was by the figure. Indeed,
    figure painters in general filled me with a kind of cool
    respect rather than with warm sympathy</p>

    <p>However, I remember very well being most impressed by a
    drawing of Daumier's: an old man under the chestnut trees in
    the Champs Elys&eacute;es (an illustration for Balzac), though
    the drawing was not all that important. What impressed me so
    much at the time was something so stout and manly in Daumier's
    conception, something that made me think It must be good to
    think and to feel like that and to overlook or ignore a
    multitude of things and to concentrate on what makes us sit up
    and think and what touches us as human beings more directly and
    personally than meadows or clouds.</p>

    <p>That is also why I always feel attracted to the figures of
    both the English draughtsmen and of the English writers, whose
    Monday-morning-like soberness and studied restraint and prose
    and analysis is something solid and substantial to which one
    can hang on in days when one feels weak. Among French writers
    the same is true of Balzac and Zola.</p>

    <p>I don't know the books by Murger you mention, but I hope to
    become acquainted with them soon.</p>

    <p>Did I tell you that I was reading Daudet's Les Rois en Exil?
    I thought it rather good.</p>

    <p>The titles of those books greatly appeal to me, for
    instance, La Boh&egrave;me [he is referring to Sc&egrave;nes de
    la vie Boh&egrave;me, by Henry Murger]. How far we have strayed
    nowadays from la boh&egrave;me of Gavarni's time! It seems to
    me that there was definitely something warmer and more
    light-hearted and alive about those days than there is today.
    But I cannot be certain, and there is much good nowadays, or
    there could be much more than in fact there is if there were
    greater solidarity.</p>

    <p>At the moment I can see a splendid effect out of my studio
    window. The city, with its towers and roofs and smoking
    chimneys, is outlined as a dark, sombre silhouette against a
    horizon of light. This light is, however, no more than a broad
    streak over which hangs a heavy raincloud, more concentrated
    below, torn above by the autumn wind into large shreds and
    lumps that are being chased away. But that streak of light is
    making the wet roofs glisten here and there in the dark mass of
    the city (on a drawing one would achieve this with a stroke of
    body colour), so that although the mass has a single tone one
    can still distinguish between red tiles and slates. The
    Schenkweg runs through the foreground like a glistening streak
    through the wetness; the poplars have yellow leaves, the banks
    of the ditches and the meadows are a deep green; the little
    figures are black. I would have drawn it, or rather tried to
    draw it, if I hadn't been working hard all afternoon on figures
    of peat-carriers, which are still too much on my mind to allow
    room for anything new, and should be allowed to linger.</p>

    <p>I long for you so often and think of you so much. What you
    tell me about the character of some artists in Paris, who live
    with women, and are less narrow minded than others, perhaps
    trying desperately to preserve something youthful, I think is
    shrewdly observed indeed. Such people can be found here as
    well. It may be even more difficult over there than it is here
    to preserve some freshness in one's daily life, because to do
    so there means swimming even more against the tide. How many
    have not become desperate in Paris - calmly, rationally,
    logically and rightly desperate. I have been reading something
    of that sort about Tassaert, whom I like very much, and I feel
    sorry that this was what happened to him.</p>

    <p>All the more, all the more do I consider every effort in
    that direction worthy of respect. I also think it is possible
    to achieve success without having to start out with despair.
    Even though one loses out here and there, and even though one
    sometimes feels a kind of exhaustion; one must rally and take
    courage again, even though things should turn out differently
    from what one originally intended.</p>

    <p>Please don't think that I look with contempt on such persons
    as you describe, just because their lives are not based on
    serious and well-considered principles. My opinion on the
    matter is this: what matters is <i>deeds</i>, not some abstract
    idea. I only approve of principles and think them worth the
    trouble if they turn into deeds, and I think it is good to
    reflect and to try to be conscientious, because this
    concentrates a man's energies and combines his various actions
    into a whole. The people you describe would, I believe, be more
    resolute if they thought more clearly about what they were
    going to do, but for the rest I greatly prefer the likes of
    them to people who parade their principles without taking the
    slightest trouble or even thinking about putting them into
    practice. For the latter gain nothing from the most beautiful
    principles and the former are precisely the people who,
    <i>if</i> they come round to living with resolve and
    thoughtfulness, might do something great. For great things do
    not done just happen by impulse but are a succession of small
    things linked together.</p>

    <p>What is drawing? How does one learn it? It is working
    through an invisible iron wall that seems to stand between what
    one <i>feels</i> and what one <i>can do</i>. How is one
    to get through that wall - since pounding at it is of no use?
    In my opinion one has to undermine that wall, filing through it
    steadily and patiently. And there you are - how can one
    continue such work assiduously without being distracted or
    diverted, unless one reflects and orders one's life according
    to principles? And as it is with art so it is with other
    things. And great things are not something accidental, they
    must be distinctly <i>willed</i>.</p>

    <p>Whether a man's deeds originate in his principles or his
    principles in his deeds is something that seems to me as
    indeterminable (and as little worthy of determination) as the
    question of which came first, the chicken or the egg. But I
    consider that trying to develop one's power of thought and will
    is something positive and of much moment.</p>

    <p>I am very curious to know what you will make of the figures
    I am doing these days, when you eventually see them. That poses
    another chicken and egg question: must one do figures for a
    previously planned composition, or combine figures that one has
    done separately so that they give rise to a composition? It
    seems to me that it probably comes down to the same thing,
    <i>provided only that one keeps working</i>.</p>

    <p>I conclude with the same thing you said at the end of your
    letter, that we share a liking for peering behind the scenes,
    or, in other words, we have a tendency to analyze things. Now I
    believe that this is precisely the quality one has to have in
    order to paint - the strength one must exert in painting or
    drawing. It may be that nature has favoured us to some extent
    (in any case you and I certainly have it - perhaps we owe it to
    our boyhood in Brabant and to surroundings that taught us to
    think more than is usual), but it is really and truly not until
    later that the artistic sensibility develops and ripens through
    work. I cannot tell you <i>how</i> you might become a very good
    painter, but that you have it in you and can bring it out is
    something I really do believe. Goodbye, my dear fellow, thank
    you for what you sent me and an affectionate handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I have already lit my little stove. My dear fellow, how I
    wish we could just spend an evening together looking at
    drawings and sketches and woodcuts, I have some splendid new
    ones. I hope to get some boys from the orphanage to pose for me
    this week, I might yet be able to save that drawing of
    orphans.</p>
