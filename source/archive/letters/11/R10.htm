  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Herewith I want to thank you for your last letter, which I
    certainly should have done sooner if I had not been upset
    recently. The fact is, you know, that I did not receive your
    letter in my studio but in the hospital, where I have been for
    three weeks now. Therefore your letter was doubly welcome to me
    during those days, and what you said about the drawings, which
    do not seem to have been very much to my worthy uncle's liking,
    pleased me doubly too.</p>

    <p>Later on I heard from somebody else that they were not so
    bad after all, and that he had not meant to speak so harshly.
    Whatever the truth may be, the fact is that, while doing those
    drawings and later making some similar ones of the fish-drying
    barns on the dunes, <label content="health.venereal">I caught a cold, complicated with fever and
    nerves, all of which seems to have affected my bladder, so that
    I could not urinate, which finally distressed me so much and
    was so painful that I came here. Then they messed about in my
    bladder with a catheter, and so on, so that I am now returning
    to a more normal condition, of which I am very glad. For all
    that, I am not cured yet, and I don't know if I shall be able
    to go home soon or not. I hope it will be over in a week, but
    of course such things take their own time.</label></p>

    <p>It is very pleasant here in this hospital; I am lying in a
    ward with ten beds, but, as I had to keep quiet, I have not
    been able to draw until today, and even now it is only a very
    faint and feeble start; I cannot do what I want and penetrate
    to the core of things.</p>

    <p>But now I am allowed to go into the garden for an hour every
    day, and yesterday I started scribbling a little. And at least
    I am beginning to look at things again, though at first I felt
    too rotten even to use my eyes.</p>

    <p>When I leave here, I shall have to go about my business very
    quietly for a while. Well, we shall see....</p>

    <p>What I especially want to praise here is the treatment. If I
    ever happen to fall ill again, I should as little hesitate to
    go to a hospital as I did this time. In my opinion it is
    infinitely more practical than being ill at home, at least
    under circumstances such as mine.</p>

    <p>Going by the way I feel, I am almost completely recovered,
    but the difficulty is that by moving about too much, taking
    long walks, etc., I may immediately have a relapse, which
    happened to me last week, and but for that I should be further
    ahead now.</p>

    <p>As soon as I have a number of drawings again, as for
    instance the ones of the fish-drying barns or a charity court,
    I shall be most happy to send you some, which you may be able
    to sell. However, I shall not hurry, but rather wait until one
    of them turns out better than usual, for in that case I prefer
    sending it to you rather than to Amsterdam. Although I hope
    Amsterdam will come around again.</p>

    <p>And let us agree that, if you do not succeed in selling it,
    you need not feel ashamed to return it to me, and you need not
    think it would discourage me, for such things do not succeed
    all at once. So whether it be the fault of my drawing or the
    fault of a possible buyer, let us agree on both sides that the
    miscarriage of our attempt (if it should fail) will not
    discourage us immediately.</p>

    <p>As soon as I am at work again, I shall write you at an early
    date. Once more thanks for your letter, which I did not want to
    postpone answering any longer.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
