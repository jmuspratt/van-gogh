    <p>Municipal Hospital (4 class ward No. 9)</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>If you come here towards the end of June, you will find me
    at work again, I hope; for the time being I am in the hospital,
    where I shall stay only a fortnight, however. <label content="psychology.insomnia">For three weeks I
    have been suffering from insomnia </label>and low fever, and <label content="health.venereal">passing
    water was painful. And now it seems that I really have what
    they call the &ldquo;clap,&rdquo; but only a mild case.</label></p>

    <p>So now I have to stay quietly in bed here, swallow many
    quinine pills, and also have injections now and then, either of
    pure water or of alum water, so it is as harmless as can be.
    Therefore you need not worry at all about it. But you know, one
    must not neglect such things, and should have them attended to
    at once, because neglect only aggravates it. Witness Breitner,
    who is still here, though in another ward, and perhaps he will
    leave soon; he doesn't know I'm here. You will do me a favour
    by not talking about it, for people sometimes exaggerate so,
    and gossip makes things seem worse. You're the only one I'm
    telling exactly what it is; you needn't keep it a secret if
    anyone should ask you directly, and at all events you needn't
    get alarmed about it.</p>

    <p>Of course I had to pay a fortnight in advance, 10.50
    guilders for all expenses. There is no difference as to food or
    treatment between the persons who are free patients and those
    who pay 10.50 guilders; there are ten patients in a ward, and I
    can only say that the treatment is very good in all respects. I
    do not feel bored at all, and the rest and the thoroughly
    practical, intensive medical treatment do me good.</p>

    <p>If it is convenient, be so kind as to send 50 fr. about June
    20 to the above-mentioned address, but <i>not</i> by registered
    mail. You know that I received 100 fr. on June 1. So then I
    shall be safe no matter what happens. If I have to stay longer,
    I will pay extra and stay on, and if not, I shall have the
    money to start work again. Of course I should prefer to start
    working in a fortnight, and within a fortnight I shall
    certainly be longing for a walk in the dunes.</p>

    <p>Sien comes to see me on visiting days and keeps an eye on
    the studio.</p>

    <p>Now you should know that the day before I came here, I
    received a letter from C. M. in which he wrote a whole lot
    about the &ldquo;interest&rdquo; he has in me, and which he
    says Mr. Tersteeg has also shown me, but he did not approve of
    my having been so ungrateful to Tersteeg for his marks of
    sympathy. It may be so. I am lying here calmly and quietly
    enough, but I can tell you, Theo, that I should certainly lose
    my temper if some person or other came to see me again with the
    kind of interest Tersteeg has shown me on certain occasions.
    And when I think how he pushed his interest so far as to have
    the nerve to compare me with an opium smoker, then I am still
    astonished that for my part I did not show him my interest in
    the form of a &ldquo;go to hell.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Speaking of smoking opium - the comfort and the luxury, the
    kind of glory in which H. G. T. moves, and a reasonably strong
    dose of flattery people in general administer to him, these are
    the things which drug his Honour more than he himself is
    conscious of.</p>

    <p>In short, notwithstanding the superficial elegance of his
    behaviour, notwithstanding his superficially refined manners,
    his nice clothes, etc., etc., when thinking them over, and also
    recalling them to my mind, I find something
    &ldquo;<i>false</i>&rdquo; in his Honour's character. I wish it
    were otherwise, but I cannot speak differently.</p>

    <p>Without doubting for a moment that his Honour is a clever
    man, another question is important to my respecting him. Is he
    a good man? That is to say, a man who does not nurture hatred,
    grudges, chicanery, sarcasm in his mind merely on principle.
    That is the question.</p>

    <p>I did not answer C. M.'s last letter, nor shall I. However,
    I appreciate his saying that sometime he will buy from me again
    out of interest, especially if he means it, which remains to be
    seen.</p>

    <p>Of course a letter from you would make me very happy these
    days. Sien is getting ready to go to Leyden. I often think of
    her - I am expecting her now - I hope she will pull through
    safely.</p>

    <p>I have fought against being ill as long as I could, and
    continued working, but at last I felt it was urgent to consult
    a doctor.</p>

    <p>But this morning he again told me that I would soon be
    better.</p>

    <p>I am the less sorry to be lying quietly here for a few days,
    seeing that in case I should need to, I should be able to get
    an official statement from the doctor here to the effect that I
    am not the person to be sent to Gheel or to be put under
    guardianship.</p>

    <p>And if this should not be enough, another one, if I were to
    take the trouble, from the Medical Director of the Lying-in
    Hospital at Leyden, a professor.</p>

    <p>But perhaps those people who might possibly feel the urge to
    declare that it would be such a great advantage to
    <i>society</i> or to the <i>family</i> if someone like me were
    declared insane or put under guardianship are such awfully big
    bugs that they know much more about those things than, for
    instance, the doctor here. Enfin.</p>

    <p>Did you receive the two little drawings?</p>

    <p>Adieu, a handshake, and wishing you as much prosperity as a
    man can stand,</p>

    <p>Yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>I feel obliged to tell you again that in case they want to
    attempt something like putting me under guardianship on
    <i>physical</i> grounds, the precedent of the Gheel affair
    would make it awkward for the family suddenly to take a
    different stand, and base their action no longer on
    <i>physical</i> but on <i>financial</i> grounds.</p>

    <p>Such things don't cut any ice. But I repeat, I hope things
    will not be pushed as far as that.</p>

    <p>But please write soon, for I am anxiously looking forward to
    a letter from you. You understand, Theo, that I don't talk
    about family matters with either the physician here or the
    professor at Leyden - only seeing that I am being treated by
    the former and Sien, by the latter, if I needed it, one word
    would get me a statement from these gentlemen, contradicting a
    possible differing statement by some persons you spoke of.</p>
