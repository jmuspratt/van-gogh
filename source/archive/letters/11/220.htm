  <body>
    <p>Wednesday morning</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I do not want you to imagine my being in a depressed or
    abnormal mood. And therefore I already wrote you in my last
    letter about my work, and as I have to ask you a few things in
    connection with it, I will not put off writing again.</p>

    <p>When you come, I want to try and show you some watercolours
    done in different ways. Then we can see and talk over what you
    think is best. So I work regularly on that every day, and will
    continue to do so until you come.</p>

    <p>I have now made three of Scheveningen, also <art id=938>the &ldquo;Fish
    Drying Barns,&rdquo;</art> which you know - drawn as elaborately -
    but <art id=945>now there is colour too.</art> I am sure you know, Theo, that it
    is not more difficult to work in colour than <art id=940>in black and
    white;</art> indeed, perhaps the reverse, for as far as I can see,
    three-fourths of it depends on the original sketch, and almost
    the whole watercolour rests on its quality.</p>

    <p>It is not sufficient to give an &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s; it
    was and is my aim to intensify it.</p>

    <p>In the <art id=946a>black-and-white &ldquo;Fish Drying Barns&rdquo; </art>that
    is already apparent, I think, for in them you can follow
    everything and trace the composition of the whole. And look
    here, I think the reason for my working so much more easily in
    watercolours is that I have tried so hard and for such a long
    time to draw more correctly.</p>

    <p>Tersteeg called my activities a waste of time, but you will
    soon see that I have gained time. I already feel it now, and
    when you come, you will see it for yourself.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">This evening I made the rounds of all the shops, looking for
    the thick Ingres paper, but had no luck. They have the thin
    kind, but not the thick or &ldquo;double.&rdquo; Some time ago
    I bought out all of Stam's supply, and since it had been in
    stock for some time, it had turned a fine colour. When you
    come, do try to bring some for me. And if you cannot get it,
    ask for <i>papier de la forme</i>, which is cream coloured,
    strong, and one can wash on it. I also think it is much cheaper
    than Harding or Whatman, so that in the long run it saves a
    great deal.</label></p>

    <p>When you come, I know a few beautiful paths through the
    meadows where it is so quiet and restful that I am sure you
    will like it. There I discovered old and new labourers'
    cottages and other houses that are characteristic, with little
    gardens by the water's edge, very cosy. I will go and draw
    there early tomorrow morning. It is a road which runs through
    the meadows of the Schenkweg to Enthoven's factory or the
    Zieke.</p>

    <p>I saw a dead willow trunk there, just the thing for Barye,
    for instance. It was hanging over a pool that was covered with
    reeds, quite alone and melancholy, greenish, yellowish, but
    mostly a dull black, with bare white spots and knotted
    branches. I am going to attack it tomorrow morning.</p>

    <p>I also did <art id=946>a bleaching-ground at Scheveningen </art>right on the
    spot, washed in at one sitting, almost without preparation, on
    a piece of very coarse Torchon (unbleached linen).
    Enclosed a few small sketches of it[F None, JH 163].</p>

    <p>About the time of your arrival I will have some things to
    show you. I think you will like that &ldquo;Fish Drying
    Barn&rdquo; now that it is done in colour.</p>

    <p>Be sure, boy, that I am quite my old self again, and be sure
    I believe that all depends on the work, and that I consider
    everything in direct relation to it. The new studio is a great
    improvement on the old one; it makes work easier, and it is
    much better for posing especially because one can take a
    greater distance.</p>

    <p>I am sure that the extra rent I pay is made up for by better
    work.</p>

    <p>But I have a favour to ask. I could very well understand,
    and it would be very natural if, instead of sending money on
    the first of August, you gave it to me when you came, for
    instance on the seventh of August. But as I bought paper and
    paint and brushes as soon as I received your last letter, and
    shall need a few other things about the first of August, I beg
    you kindly to send me the money about the first, though you
    will be coming soon after. For I figured it out exactly, and I
    shall be absolutely penniless after the first few days of
    August. I hope it will not be inconvenient for you. Of course I
    am not asking for more, but I am asking you to send it on time,
    on the first day of August if possible, if not, in the first
    days of the month.</p>

    <p>I also have <art id=927>a second drawing of the Rijswijk meadow,</art> in
    which the same subject gets quite a different aspect through a
    change of viewpoint.</p>

    <p>[<art id=247_V-T_2200>A sketch of the Rijswijk meadow was drawn here.</art>]</p>

    <p>You see I am quite taken up by landscape, but it is because
    Sien is not yet fit to pose; nevertheless, the figure remains
    the principal thing for me.</p>

    <p>When you come, I shall take care to be near the house as
    long as you are in town so you will know where to find me; and
    then while you attend to business and pay your calls, I will go
    on drawing as usual. I can meet you by appointment wherever you
    wish, but for several reasons it is better for us both, I
    think, if I do not go with you to see Tersteeg or Mauve, etc.
    and then, <label content="lifestyle.clothing">I am so used to my working clothes, in which I can
    lie or sit on the sand or the grass, whichever is necessary
    (for in the dunes I never use a chair, only an old fish basket
    sometimes); so my dress is a little too Robinson Crusoe-like
    for paying calls with you.</label></p>

    <p>I tell you this before your visit so that you may know that
    I will not be any trouble to you, but for the rest you will
    understand that I actually long for <i>every half hour that you
    can spare</i>. I think we shall feel easier with each other if
    we stick to the subject of painting and drawing, and talk
    especially about that. But if there is nothing else which
    bothers or worries you, then remember I haven't a single secret
    from you and you have my full confidence in everything.</p>

    <p>I am also very anxious to show you the wood engravings. I
    have a splendid new one, <art id=mptychair>a drawing by Fildes, &ldquo;The Empty
    Chair of Dickens,&rdquo; from the Graphic of 1870</art>.</p>

    <p>I could have bought three etchings by M&eacute;yron for 2
    guilders, but I let them go. They were indeed very beautiful,
    but I have so few etchings, and when I buy anything, I stick to
    wood engravings. But I wanted to tell you about them - Blok is
    the one who has them; I don't know if all M&eacute;ryons are
    rare and have any money value. They are from an old series
    L'Artiste.</p>

    <p>I am still wrapped up in those books by Zola. How he
    <i>painted</i> those Halles!</p>

    <p><label subject="health.venereal">My health is pretty good, but I still feel the effect of my
    illness and will continue to for a pretty long time.</label> Sien and
    the baby are well and are getting stronger, and I love them
    both.</p>

    <p>Someday I must do the cradle in watercolour (when it is
    rainy and I cannot work outside). But for the rest I want to
    show you landscape watercolours when you come. I hope to do
    figure watercolours this winter after I have been here a year.
    First I shall have to draw more from the nude, and more in
    black and white too, I think. We shall talk all that over, and
    I am sure that your visit will contribute much toward keeping
    things in order and making the work go smoothly.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>By going quietly on with my work I have every hope of
    eventually getting an entirely new circle of acquaintances to
    compensate for the loss of the sympathy of Mauve, Tersteeg and
    others; but I will make no step toward it, not the least - it
    must come from the work itself.</p>

    <p>What has happened to me with Tersteeg is not at all unusual;
    everybody meets with such things in life. One cannot tell
    exactly where the fault lies. But with Tersteeg it is an old
    trouble. I am now almost certain that long ago he said things
    about me which contributed not a little toward putting me in a
    bad light. But I need not mind that - what could harm me before
    cannot harm me now.</p>

    <p>When you come to the studio, you will see for yourself that
    it really is absurd when he says, &ldquo;Oh! Your drawing will
    never amount to anything.&rdquo; However, it is hard to
    contradict such a remark, for as soon as one does, one is
    called conceited, and they mention the greatest artists and
    say, &ldquo;He fancies he's like them.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>But I repeat, everyone who works with love and intelligence
    finds a kind of armour against the opinion of other people in
    the very sincerity of his love for nature and art. Nature is
    also severe and, so to speak, hard; but she never deceives and
    always helps us on.</p>

    <p>So I do not count my falling into disgrace with Tersteeg, or
    whomever, a misfortune; though I am sorry about it, <i>that</i>
    cannot be the real cause of misfortune. If I had no love for
    nature or my work, then I should indeed be misfortunate. The
    worse I get along with people, the more I learn to have faith
    in nature and to concentrate on her.</p>

    <p><i>All those things make me feel brighter and fresher</i> -
    you will see that I am not afraid of a bright green or a soft
    blue, and the thousands of different greys, for there is
    scarcely any colour that is not grey: red- grey, yellow-grey,
    green-grey, blue-grey. This is the substance of the whole
    colour scheme.</p>

    <p>When I returned to that fish drying barn, a wonderfully
    bright fresh green of turnips or rapes had sprouted in those
    baskets full of sand in the foreground which serve to prevent
    the sand from drifting off the dunes. Two months ago everything
    was bare except the grass in the little garden, and now this
    rough, wild, luxuriant growth forms a very pretty effect in
    contrast to the bareness of the rest.</p>

    <p>I hope you will like this drawing, the distant horizon, the
    view across the roofs of the village with the little church
    steeple, and the dunes - it was all so fine. I can't tell you
    what great pleasure I had making it. So do come soon. I think
    you will approve of the change of studio when you see that it
    gives me an infinitely better opportunity to work - more
    distance, better light, more room.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.parents">Last night I received a parcel from home. Among other things
    there was a sort of spring coat, which comes in very handy. I
    thought it very kind of them. And there was tobacco in it, and
    cigars, and cake and some underwear. In short, quite a parcel.
    Wasn't that nice of them? I appreciate it perhaps more for the
    kind thought than for anything else.</label></p>

    <p>I also had a letter from Van Rappard.</p>

    <p>I am confoundedly pleased that the fellow is so absorbed in
    his English wood engravings. It is true I encouraged him in the
    beginning, but now he no longer needs any encouragement, he is
    almost as enthusiastic about it as I. When you come, I will
    show you a few which you will not soon forget after you have
    seen them. And there are things among them quite different from
    Boughton's style, for instance, though he certainly is also one
    of the main ones. I mean things remarkable for their reality
    and style, like Albrecht D&uuml;rer's, and yet at the same time
    with much local colour and chiaroscuro. One does not see these
    things often now, for one has to look for them in magazines of
    ten and fifteen years ago, for instance, at the time of the war
    of '70 - '71.</p>
