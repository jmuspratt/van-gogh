  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Your registered letter arrived in good order, many thanks.
    From your letter I gathered that you are very busy with the
    inventory; good luck with it, it will be a tough job.</p>

    <p>How I wish we could be together these two Christmas days - I
    should so love to see you in the studio again.</p>

    <p>I too have been working hard lately, just because I was full
    of that Christmas sentiment; the feeling is not enough, one
    must express it in one's work.</p>

    <p>So I am now working on <art id=954>two large heads </art>of an old man from
    the workhouse, <art id=954a>with his wide beard and his shabby old-fashioned
    top hat</art>. The old fellow has the
    kind of wrinkled, witty face that one should like to have near
    a cozy Christmas fire.</p>

    <p>Harper published a Christmas issue illustrated by some
    painters who call themselves the &ldquo;Tile Club.&rdquo;
    Boughton is one of them. The best of the drawings are by Abbey
    - they are mainly scenes from long ago, when the Dutch founded
    New York under the name of New Amsterdam.</p>

    <p>I think these drawings have been reproduced by the process
    you described on the paper which Buhot sent a sample of. I must
    compare these American drawings again with the pictures in Vie
    Moderne.</p>

    <p>I trust I shall be able to learn it, and who knows, maybe
    next year we shall be able to make a trial.</p>

    <p>While you are so busy just now, I'll try my utmost to make
    some drawings for that purpose. When you are less busy after a
    while, I shall have to ask you or Buhot some more about it.</p>

    <p>But I see clearly enough that the process is very
    <i>satisfactory</i>, that, if the drawing is good, one is
    almost sure of a good reproduction. So working on the drawings
    is the main thing.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">As to lithography, as I have assisted a few times at the
    printing and the preparation of the stone, I think I shall try
    to make some lithographs without having recourse to paper, etc.
    - simply by drawing on the stone itself.</label> For much as I like
    those drawings in Harper's Christmas Number or in Vie Moderne,
    still there is always something mechanical in them, something
    of a photograph or photogravure, and I prefer an ordinary
    lithograph by Daumier or Gavarni or Lemud. Well, a firm hand
    for drawing is needed for one as well as for the other, that's
    the main thing.</p>

    <p>I am afraid that a new process is one of those things which
    cannot quite satisfy one, that it is in fact rather too smooth.
    I mean that an ordinary etching, an ordinary wood engraving, or
    an ordinary lithograph has a charm which cannot be replaced by
    anything mechanical.</p>

    <p>The same can be said of engraving - the photogravure
    reproduction of the &ldquo;Sewing Class&rdquo; by Isra&euml;ls,
    for instance, or of the picture by Blommers or Artz is superb -
    the way they are published by Goupil and Co. But if this
    process should entirely replace the real engraving, I think in
    the long run one would miss the ordinary engraving, with all
    its difficulties and imperfections.</p>

    <p>Rappard is still sick, though the crisis is past; he is very
    weak, his father writes.</p>

    <p>What is it? I don't know - perhaps brain fever or
    inflammation? His father doesn't give particulars.</p>

    <p>Well, I hope your Christmas will be pleasant after all -
    that you will be able to take a nice long walk, and that you
    will have a good time - but I am afraid you will be up to your
    ears in the inventory. Well, work is always cheering, even the
    kind of work which isn't very pleasant in itself.</p>

    <p>My very best wishes, write again if you can, but if you are
    too busy, I'll understand perfectly, and then you will make up
    for it later by a few descriptions of Montmartre or so. Adieu,
    with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
