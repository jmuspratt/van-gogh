    <p>[Postcard, written in English]</p>

    <p>Today I sent you by post 1 drawing,<art id=933> &ldquo;A Root in a dry
    ground.&rdquo;</art> Just let me know what you think
    of it. &ldquo;The Roots&rdquo; is very similar to this one, but
    I cannot send that one, neither &ldquo;Sorrow&rdquo; in this
    manner on a roller, the drawings being mounted on cardboard.
    <label content="art.technique">With regard to this one I hammered it off in a single day,
    having studied the same spot and trees for &ldquo;The
    Roots.&rdquo; So it has been done &ldquo;tout d'un trait&rdquo;
    out of doors, and has not even been in my studio.</p>

    <p>But the paper has been slightly damaged in 2 or 3 places, as
    I worked through it; please have this seen to at once, else it
    might get worse. I think it wants a grey mount.</label> Good bye, I
    hope to hear from you at your earliest convenience.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Tuesday evening.</p>
