  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your last letter with the 180 fr. enclosed in
    good order; my heartfelt thanks for it.</p>

    <p>I am very glad you liked the drawing I sent you; I think
    there really is something in it.</p>

    <p>I wish you would have it put on a simple grey mount, for it
    will look best that way.</p>

    <p>Further, I partly agree with you in what you say about the
    aspect of some drawings having something which can best be
    compared to an eau-forte non &eacute;barb&eacute;e [unpolished
    copperplate etching]. However, I believe that this peculiar
    effect in drawings, which I think the connoisseurs rightly
    appreciate, is caused more by a peculiar tremor of the hand
    when working under emotion than by the material one uses (of
    course, with etchings it is different - there it is caused by
    the barbe, burr, of the plate). Among my studies I myself have
    a few which look rather like what I shall call non
    &eacute;barb&eacute;e. <label content="art.technique">If I have not fixed your drawing, or
    have worked on it again here and there after having fixed it,
    so that there are spots with an unpleasant shine, just pour a
    large glass of milk, or water and milk, over it and let it dry;
    you will see that it gives a peculiar saturated black, much
    more effective than is generally seen in a pencil drawing.</label></p>

    <p>To get that peculiar look, non &eacute;barb&eacute;e, I
    think one ought not to use crayon but rather charcoal which has
    been soaked in oil.</p>

    <p>Of course I sent the 25 guilders to Mr. Tersteeg at once,
    and have received a receipt for it <i>without one written
    word</i>. He may talk about being &ldquo;hurt,&rdquo; but I
    wish he would only consider how hurt I must have felt, always
    hearing such things as, &ldquo;You do not earn your living, you
    have lost your rights,&rdquo; and I don't know what else. Such
    things really don't hurt less but infinitely more <i>than what
    I said to him</i> - such things sometimes pierce the heart and
    deeply grieve the soul.</p>

    <p>But what's the use of talking about it any more?</p>

    <p>As to his buying or not, I consider that quite different,
    quite separate from personal disputes or differences of view on
    some subjects; I should think whether or not he buys from me
    would depend not on me but on my work. Let him buy my work (as
    I make more progress) or not buy it because he either does or
    doesn't like it. He may buy it for himself or another, but it
    is not exactly fair to let a personal antipathy influence one's
    judgement, or, on the other hand, to let the personal charm of
    some artist influence one into overlooking faults in his
    work.</p>

    <p>There certainly is an affinity between a person and his
    work, but it is not easy to define what this affinity is, and
    on that question many judge quite wrongly.</p>

    <p>And now, yes, I know that Mother is ill, and I know many
    other sad things besides, either in our own family or in
    others'.</p>

    <p>And I am not insensible to it, and I don't think I should be
    able to draw <art id=929a>&ldquo;Sorrow&rdquo;</art> if I didn't feel it. But
    since last summer it has become clear to me that the disharmony
    between Father, Mother and myself has become a chronic evil
    because there has been misunderstanding and estrangement
    between us for too long a time. And now it has gone so far that
    we must suffer for it on both sides.</p>

    <p>I mean, we might have helped each other more if long ago we
    had tried on both sides to live in closer understanding and to
    share weal and woe, always remembering that parents and
    children must remain one. We didn't make these mistakes on
    purpose, and for the greater part they must be ascribed to the
    force majeure of difficult circumstances and a hurried life.
    Now I have become little more than a half strange, half
    tiresome person to Father and Mother; and for my part, when I'm
    at home, I also have a lonesome, empty feeling. Opinions and
    professions differ so much that we unintentionally annoy each
    other, but I repeat, it is quite involuntary. This is a very
    sad feeling, but life and the world are full of such
    unsatisfactory relationships, and it really does more harm than
    good to reproach each other - sometimes the best thing to do in
    such a case is to avoid each other. But I don't know what's
    best; I wish I did.</p>

    <p>Well, Father and Mother find comfort in their work and I in
    mine. For, brother, in spite of all the little miseries, I work
    with great animation.</p>

    <p>I have just received a letter from Rappard; I have been
    &ldquo;en froid&rdquo; with him for some time, but now we are
    interested in each other's work again. Probably he will come to
    see me soon. The other day I was at Blommers' studio; the
    exhibition of wood engravings did not come off after all, but I
    gained this much by it that I at last found time to sort and
    arrange them. But it is impossible for me to give enough time
    to it or to take the trouble to find new wood engravings, as
    day by day I become more absorbed in drawing.</p>

    <p>Today I made another nude study of a woman's figure,
    kneeling, and yesterday one of a girl knitting, but also nude,
    which I told you before I wanted to do.</p>

    <p>Now, sleep well, it is late at night; once more thanks for
    what you sent, and believe me with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>

    <p>I hope to make you a pendant for &ldquo;Sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
