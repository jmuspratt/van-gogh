  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>What I feel obliged to tell you once more is this. You know
    very well that up to this very day there has been nothing in my
    life of a criminal nature, and that I am in full possession of
    my civil rights as a Netherlander. Further, that I shall take
    good care to avoid all things prohibited by the laws of this
    country, but consequently that I shall not suffer myself to be
    molested or to be put under guardianship or anything of the
    sort. I know quite well that in our family very ugly things
    have been said about me repeatedly and in various ways,
    although I do not know the source from which they originated.
    But I very much doubt whether those who said them would have
    the courage to swear to them before a judge or something like
    that. I do not know if you have the Dutch constitution and the
    other laws in your possession. Personally, I have consulted
    them repeatedly on questions in which I myself was concerned
    when I was in doubt whether this or that was legally justified.
    And not just the Dutch laws; at times I even took the trouble
    to compare the Dutch regulations with the French or English
    constitutions. It wasn't just recently necessary for me to look
    up the law; I had to in the past, when I was studying some
    points in history.</p>

    <p>Therefore I can tell you in all tranquillity that I am
    waiting for things to take their course; I only hope that
    nothing of the sort will happen and that, on the contrary, the
    family will prove disposed to arrange things reasonably and
    peacefully, should the necessity arise.</p>

    <p>I must tell you, Theo, that sometimes I perceived that
    Father, for instance, does <i>not</i> always take the trouble
    to look things up, or that he bases and maintains a judgement
    on such shaky premises and such superficial impressions,
    information or gossip that it doesn't cut any ice. Besides one
    should not consider a clause separately, without relation to
    other laws, but rather relate it to the modifications and
    clarifications of the pertinent clauses which appear with
    it.</p>

    <p>When the law says, for instance, &ldquo;A child owes respect
    to its parents,&rdquo; which is the introduction to the law on
    paternal rights, it is not enough to fly into a rage and say,
    &ldquo;You don't show enough respect for your parents&rdquo; -
    one ought to think it over and try to find out if there really
    is something illegal in the child's behaviour before one starts
    shouting about the law.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.family">But this is what happens so often in our family - there is
    some gossip, it is inflated, it is exaggerated to the limit;
    and then they form an opinion or a resolution about someone,
    sometimes wholly without the particular person's knowledge or
    without having talked it over with him, only taking notice of
    impressions, hearsay, communications (the devil take them,
    particularly the last!). Our venerable Uncle Cent also has a
    way of gathering &ldquo;information&rdquo; which I consider
    anything but fair. As for me, when I saw such things happen at
    home, I told Father often enough, You will find no blessing in
    it.</label></p>

    <p>Just think, Theo, how different things might have been at
    home, for instance, if Father could have been less distrustful
    of me, a bit less suspicious; if, instead of considering me a
    person who could only do wrong, he had shown more patience and
    good will in order to understand my real intentions - in which
    he has always been sorely mistaken. In the first place, he
    would have felt less grief on my account, and would have been
    easier in his mind about me; and in the second place, he would
    have spared me much sorrow. For it is a great sorrow to think,
    This is worse than having no home at all, no father, no mother,
    no relations - and I have often thought so, as I do now.</p>

    <p>But one thing is certain, it is wrong to act and leave the
    person concerned out of things; I do not even believe in a
    family council taking resolutions about a person unless the
    accused, or rather the person over whom the family council was
    gathered, is present. But what is a family council? In most
    cases nothing more than an intrigue, and occasionally a
    vindication of family pride - beaucoup de bruit pour peu de
    besogne [much ado about nothing].</p>

    <p>But often something is decided upon which proves that the
    persons who were present did not take the law into account, and
    the resolution would not cut any ice if it were actually laid
    before a judge.</p>

    <p>If I really were bad or vicious or a mischief-maker or a low
    schemer or an incompetent, I should really be afraid. However,
    being what I am, I firmly believe I need not be afraid of
    anything the family or some members of the family may attempt
    to do.</p>

    <p>It is my sincere wish that nothing will be attempted, not
    because I am afraid of anything, but because I prefer peace to
    bickering.</p>

    <p>I do wish you knew Sien, but you are so far away, and it is
    impossible for me to describe a person in such a way that you
    would know her well just from that description. However, I can
    try.</p>

    <p>Do you remember our old nurse at Zundert, Leen Veerman? If my
    memory does not deceive me, Sien is that kind of person. Her
    type of profile resembles &ldquo;L'Ange de la Passion&rdquo; by
    Landelle, you know the one I mean, a kneeling figure; the print
    is published by Goupil. But of course she is not exactly like
    this, I say it only to give you an idea of the lines of her
    face. She is slightly pock-marked, so she is no longer
    beautiful, but the lines of her figure are simple and not
    ungraceful.</p>

    <p>What I appreciate in her is that she is not coquettish with
    me, goes her way quietly, is thrifty, is quite willing to adapt
    herself to the circumstances and to learn, so that she will be
    able to help me with my work in a thousand ways. And she is
    useful to me just because she is no longer handsome, no longer
    young, no longer coquettish, no longer foolish. Her health has
    been very bad, and last winter she was very weak. Now, by
    eating simple food, by walking in the open air a lot, and by
    taking baths, she has become much healthier and stronger. But
    pregnancy is a difficult time. However, her speech is ugly and
    she often says things and uses expressions which, for instance,
    our sister Willemien, who has been brought up differently,
    would never use. But this is something that I don't mind in the
    least. I would rather have her speak coarsely and be good than
    be refined in speech and heartless. But that is just it - she
    has a good heart, has endurance, patience and good will, puts
    herself out to help me. She comes every week to clean the
    studio to save the money I should have to pay a cleaning woman.
    Well, we shall be poor at times, but as long as she has enough
    to eat, she is not sickly in the sense of having some ailment,
    but she has suffered a great deal, for instance, she had
    smallpox and later throat trouble. But there is no reason why
    she cannot live long and get quite well again.</p>

    <p>I must put a question to you confidentially. Do you think
    Father is afraid that I shall ask him for money on this
    occasion? I certainly wouldn't. Father has often told me that
    my education, etc., has cost more than that of the others,
    therefore in case of my marriage I would not ask Father for
    anything, not even for an old cup and saucer. Sien and I have
    what's strictly necessary. The only thing we cannot do without,
    as long as I do not sell my work, is the 150 fr. from you, for
    rent, bread, shoes, drawing materials - in short, for daily
    expenses.</p>

    <p>I ask nothing, not even an old cup and saucer. <i>I ask but
    one single thing: to let me love and care for my poor, weak,
    ill-used little wife as well as my poverty permits, without
    their trying to separate, worry or hurt us.</i></p>

    <p>Nobody cared for her or wanted her, she was alone and
    forsaken like a worthless rag, and I have taken her up and have
    given her all the love, all the tenderness, all the care that
    was in me; she has felt this and she has revived, or rather,
    she is reviving.</p>

    <p>You know the old fable or parable: There was a poor man in a
    town who had but one single little ewe lamb which he had bought
    and fed, and it had been raised in his house - it ate his bread
    and drank from his cup and slept in his arms, and it was like a
    daughter to him. There was also a rich man in that town who
    possessed many herds of sheep and oxen, but he took that one
    ewe lamb from the poor man and killed it.</p>

    <p>You see, if Tersteeg, for instance, could do what he liked,
    he would separate Sien from me, force her back into her former
    damned life which she has always hated - and why?</p>

    <p>Know it well, the life of the woman, of the children, of me,
    depends on that little thread of 150 fr. a month until my work
    begins to sell. If that little thread breaks before that time,
    then &ldquo;morituri te salutant.&rdquo; It is the least we can
    manage on, and only with the greatest economy at that. But we
    are happy this way because love binds us so closely.</p>

    <p>Whether Father and Mother take it quietly or not will
    three-fourths depend on what you tell them. If you oppose me,
    then the trouble starts. If you say something like, Keep calm,
    don't meddle, or if you try to reassure them in some way, they
    will keep quiet. You need not compromise yourself, however, or
    take any responsibility. In no way, for that responsibility
    rests with me, but if you remain to me what you have been until
    now, you can reassure then in two ways as to the financial
    side. First, that I have your monthly allowance for the
    necessary expenses, secondly, that I shall not ask anything
    from them, not a penny, not even an old cup and saucer.
    Finally, that I already have what's strictly necessary -
    furniture, bedding, child's clothes, cradle, etc.</p>

    <p>Well, brother, I hope all &ldquo;dramatic&rdquo; scenes will
    be avoided, and that we may all keep calm; that is what I hope
    and strive for.</p>
