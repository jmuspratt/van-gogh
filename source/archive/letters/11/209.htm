  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have just got back to my studio and am writing you at
    once. I cannot tell you how delightful it is to be better
    again, nor can I tell you how beautiful all things appeared to
    me on the way from the hospital; and how the light seemed
    clearer and the spaces more infinite, and every object and
    figure more important.<label content="health.venereal"> But there is still one drawback, for
    next Thursday I must go to see the doctor again and tell him
    how I feel; he has warned me that I may have to go to the
    hospital clinic for another fortnight, or a shorter or longer
    period, depending on what's necessary, or even be readmitted.
    At all events, it would be a piece of good luck if I did not
    have to go back.</label></p>

    <p>I must go there as soon as I feel some trouble, and even if
    I don't feel anything in particular, I must go next Tuesday to
    be examined. The channel by which the urine is excreted has to
    be widened little by little, but this cannot be done violently
    or hurriedly. Gradually the bougies they use get bigger, and
    every time one is introduced, things are stretched a little
    more; this is not only very painful but also extremely
    nauseating, as the thing is left inside for some time. There is
    bleeding when the bougie is taken out; afterwards one feels
    relatively free for some days, and the soreness it caused
    gradually disappears. And I am now here during one of those
    intervals. In the meantime I can urinate pretty easily,
    consequently I feel swell, as if this were something highly
    extraordinary. Only it will have to get quite normal again,
    which will take time. The feeling of recovery makes one forget
    all possible catheters, bougies and syringes. But one sees the
    doctor arriving with them after all, and that is not a pleasant
    moment.</p>

    <p>Well, those are the little miseries of human life.</p>

    <p>But pregnancy and confinement is something we call a
    &ldquo;grande mis&egrave;re.&rdquo; Sien's last letter was very
    melancholy; she has not been delivered yet, but awaited it
    every hour. Now that the waiting has lasted for days, I am very
    anxious about it, and it was especially to visit her that I
    asked the doctor if there were any possibility of his giving me
    a short leave instead of walks in the garden. So tomorrow
    morning I am going to see her with her mother and her child,
    Sunday being the only day for visitors. The last letter from
    her was not written by her but by the nurse, who asked if we
    could not come sometime. But maybe we shall not be allowed to
    see her after all. Poor girl; she is plucky enough though, and
    not easily frightened. No, according to that last letter there
    was no real danger, but she was very weak. I cannot tell you
    how I long for her now, and there have been moments when I was
    not sorry I had to suffer a little too, rather than stand there
    in perfect good health, for then it would have been too
    unjustly divided.</p>

    <p>If everything goes well, however, Sien will be back this
    month; may it be so. But the proverb goes, &ldquo;Mal de
    m&egrave;re dure longtemps.&rdquo; This still throws a gloomy
    shadow over the delightful feeling of recovery. I long for
    tomorrow and dread it at the same time.</p>

    <p>The first person I met here in the Schenkweg was my friend
    the carpenter, who has already helped me many a time with some
    little jobs, and by making the perspective instrument, and who
    is at the same time foreman for the owner of the studio about
    which I wrote you. His boss happened to be in <art id=944>the yard (of
    which you have the drawing</art>, the one with the meadows in the
    distance), and they coaxed me to go with them,
    and showed me they had left the room that would be my studio
    unpapered, awaiting my decision. I said I could not decide even
    now.</p>

    <p>All right, said the man, but I could choose what I liked
    from different papers; then he would paper it, and I was not
    committed to anything.</p>

    <p>And though I said I did not want this because I had to go
    back to the hospital, they have already started it, as they
    wanted to show me the finished job before Tuesday.</p>

    <p>I must say the house is exceedingly comfortable, and looks
    very neat and well built. The enormous attic alone would be a
    beautiful studio, though the room on the north would have to be
    used as such. And the price is very low indeed; in town it
    would be twice as much. Three guilders a week for a large upper
    floor is very little, even compared to neighbourhoods like the
    Noordwal or the Buitensingels, and the location is excellent
    for a painter. The view from the attic window is enchanting.
    However, I did not want to make any decision because I am ill,
    as well as Sien. But as soon as we are better, I shall take it.
    There is air and space, delightful for working in and keeping
    healthy; light from the north, and in the other room, from the
    south. There is a little kitchen, which I hope to draw often,
    also with a little window looking out on the courtyard.</p>

    <p>Then I must not forget to tell you that while in the
    hospital, I had an unexpected visit from Mr. Tersteeg, which in
    a way greatly pleased me, though we did not speak about
    anything in particular, as it was not necessary. But I was very
    glad to see him. And then a few days later Iterson also came,
    but I cared much less for that. And then Johan van Gogh came; I
    thought he was in Helvoirt, but it seems that at present he is
    living here in the Stationsweg.</p>

    <p>In case you send me something at the beginning of this
    month, will you address the letter to the hospital? Then it
    will be all right, because the porter promised to keep the
    letters for me in case of absence (according to the rules of
    the hospital - as long as one has not left definitely and asks
    for it). On Tuesday I have to pay the hospital again, and the
    rent, too; I have the money left for it.</p>

    <p>The most delightful thing about the whole recovery is that
    the love for drawing revives, and also the feeling for things
    around me which seemed almost extinct for a long time and had
    left a great void. I am again interested in everything I see.
    And then, I have not smoked a pipe for almost a month, and it's
    like renewing an old acquaintance. I cannot tell you how happy
    I am to sit here in the studio again after having been
    surrounded by chamber pots, etc., for so long, though the
    hospital is also beautiful, very beautiful, especially the
    garden with all those convalescent people - men, women and
    children. I made a few scratches, but as a patient one is not
    free to work as one should, nor is one fit for it. Well, adieu,
    write soon and believe me, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
