  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Though I have nothing particular to tell you, I want to
    write you again. In contrast to what I wrote you - that I often
    feel heavy-hearted about many things, that I cannot consider
    everything progress, etc. - what I said on another occasion is
    still true, too - that there are things which are worth doing
    one's utmost for, because whether people like them or not, they
    have in themselves a raison d'&ecirc;tre. Blessed is he who has
    found his work, says Carlyle, and that is decidedly true.</p>

    <p>As for myself, when I say I want to make types of the people
    for the people, of course the state of affairs influences me
    only indirectly, in so far as to make my work harder or easier,
    but making the drawings themselves is what preoccupies me the
    most. And so, in contrast to a feeling of depression, there is
    the delightful sense of working at something which becomes more
    and more interesting the deeper one gets into it.</p>

    <p>When I told you in my last letter that I sometimes feel as
    if I were in some kind of prison, I meant only that I cannot do
    many things which I should like to do - which would only be
    possible if I had the money - but I certainly did not mean to
    say that I do not appreciate the present or that I am
    discontented, far from it. It is just by doing what is within
    our reach that we have a chance of making progress, so be
    assured that whenever you find work for me on the magazines
    yonder, I shall gladly try my best.</p>

    <p>Although you write, I do not think the illustrated magazines
    take a straight road, it needn't be a reason for my being
    unwilling to work for them. I am only afraid that they wouldn't
    like my work: if this were because of real faults, I should try
    to correct them; but if it were because of the conception or
    sentiment in general, I could do very little to change
    that.</p>

    <p>You will have received the drawing on a smaller scale, and I
    repeat once more, If you wish it, I will make a series in that
    size, just as a trial.</p>

    <p>I have two new drawings now, one of <art id=1001>a man reading his Bible</art>,
    and the other of <art id=1002>a man saying grace before
    his dinner, which is on the table</art>. Both are
    certainly done in what you may call an old-fashioned sentiment
    - they are figures like <art id=997>the little old man with his head in his
    hands.</art> The &ldquo;B&eacute;n&eacute;dicit&eacute;&rdquo;
    [Grace] is, I think, the best, but they complement each other.
    In one there is a view of the snowy fields through the window.
    My intention in these two, and in the first little old man, is
    one and the same, namely to express the peculiar sentiment of
    Christmas and New Years Eve. Both in Holland and England this
    is always more or less religious, in fact, it is that way
    everywhere, at least in Brittany, and in the Alsace, too. Now
    one need not agree exactly with the form of that religious
    sentiment, but if it is sincere, it is a feeling one must
    respect. And personally, I can fully share it and even need it,
    at least to a certain extent, just the way I have a feeling for
    such a little old man and a belief in quelque chose
    l&agrave;-haut, even though I am not exactly sure <i>how</i> or
    <i>what</i> it may be. I think it a splendid saying of Victor
    Hugo's, &ldquo;<i>les religions</i> passent, mais Dieu
    demure&rdquo; [religions pass away, but God remains]; and
    another beautiful saying of Gavarni's is &ldquo;il s'agit de
    saisir ce qui ne passe pas, dans ce qui passe&rdquo; [what
    matters is to grasp what does not pass away in what passes
    away.]</p>

    <p>One of the things &ldquo;qui ne passeront pas&rdquo; is the
    quelque chose l&agrave;-haut&rdquo; [something on high] and the
    belief in God, too, thought the forms may change - a change
    which is just as necessary as the renewal of the leaves in
    spring. But you understand from this that it was not my
    intention to pay homage to the form in this drawing, but to
    show that I highly respect the Christmas and New Year's
    sentiment.</p>

    <p>And if it has any sentiment or expression, it is because I
    feel it myself.</p>

    <p>The one thing which is increasingly difficult to decide on
    is the best working method. There is so much beauty on one side
    as well as on the other - and at the same time so many things
    wrong - that sometimes one doesn't know which path to choose.
    But at all events, one must work on. But I myself do not think
    I cannot make mistakes - I am too conscious of my many errors
    to be able to say this or that is the right manner and this or
    that, the wrong one. That goes without saying. But I am not
    indifferent, I think it wrong to be so. I think it one's duty
    to try to do the right thing, even knowing that one cannot go
    through life without making mistakes, without regret or sorrow.
    Somewhere I read, <i>Some</i> good <i>must</i> come by clinging
    to the right.</p>

    <p>How can I know whether I shall reach some goal - how can I
    know beforehand whether the difficulties will or will not be
    overcome?</p>

    <p>One must go on working silently, leaving the result to the
    future. If one prospect is closed, perhaps another will open
    itself - there <i>must</i> be some prospect, and a future too,
    even if we do not know its geography. Conscience is a man's
    compass, and though the needle sometimes deviates, though one
    often perceives irregularities when directing one's course by
    it, one must still try to follow its direction.</p>

    <p>I just want to copy for you something which I had in mind
    when drawing that little old man, though it is not literally
    applicable to it - for instance, it is not night in the
    drawing.</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS</p>

    Oft in the stilly night<br>

    Ere slumber's chain has bound me,<br>

    Fond memory brings the light<br>

    Of other days around me.<br>

    The smiles, the tears,<br>

    Of boyhood's years,<br>

    The words of love then spoken;<br>

    The eyes that shone,<br>

    Now dimm'd and gone,<br>

    The cheerful hearts now broken!<br>

    Thus in the stilly night<br>

    Ere slumber's chain has bound me,<br>

    Sad memory brings the light<br>

    Of other days around me.<br>

    When I remember all<br>

    The friends, so link'd together,<br>

    I've seen around me fall,<br>

    Like leaves in wintry weather,<br>

    I feel like one<br>

    Who treads alone<br>

    Some banquet hall deserted,<br>

    Whose lights are fled<br>

    Whose garlands dead,<br>

    And all but he departed!<br>

    Then in the stilly night<br>

    Ere slumber's chain has bound me<br>

    Sad memory brings the light<br>

    Of other days around me.<br>

    <p>THOMAS MOORE</p>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>Well, I hope you will enjoy nature somewhat these days,
    either in the aspect of the short wintry days, or of the wintry
    figures. What different people one sees on the streets in
    winter than in summer.</p>

    <p><label content="art.support">I read your information about Buhot's paper which you sent.
    If you think it advisable for me to work on it, I should have
    several sheets, and I think they are made in the right size, so
    that I could adjust my work to them.</label> I cannot get that paper
    here, otherwise I should have tried it already. Having read
    your information, the question also remains, If one takes a
    photograph of the drawing, which photograph is later
    transferred to zinc, are only those drawings which have been
    made on the paper in question suitable for it - can't one
    reproduce all drawings in black and white, even though they are
    made on ordinary paper? Further, Can the photographer reduce
    the size, in case the drawing is too large for the page? I
    should infer the latter from some American reproductions in
    Scribner's Magazine.</p>

    <p>Well, adieu, I hope you will write by the twentieth. With a
    handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
