  <body>
    <p>Dear brother,</p>

    <p>In my last letter I gave you, as I have before, a short and
    concise answer to some things; but for all that, you must not
    think that I am always in a freezing, unfriendly mood, which
    Mauve would perhaps call a yellow-soap or salt-water mood.
    Well, and even if I had written a yellow-soap or salt-water
    letter, that would not be worse than if I had taken things too
    sentimentally.</p>

    <p>You say, &ldquo;you will deeply regret it someday.&rdquo; My
    dear boy, I think I have done much of that regretting before
    this. I saw it coming and tried to avoid it; well, I did not
    succeed, and bygones are bygones. Shall I continue to have
    regrets? No, I really haven't time for regret. Drawing becomes
    more and more a passion with me, and it is a passion just like
    that of a sailor for the sea. Mauve has now shown me a new way
    to make something, that is, how to paint watercolours. Well, I
    am quite absorbed in this now and sit daubing and washing it
    out again; in short, I <i>am</i> trying to find a way.
    &ldquo;Puisqu'il faut faire des efforts de perdu. Puisque
    l'ex&eacute;cution d'une aquarelle a quelque chose de
    diabolique. Puisqu'il y a du bon en tout mouvement
    &eacute;nergetique.&rdquo; [Because one must make efforts like
    those of the lost souls. Because there is something diabolical
    about executing a watercolour. Because there is something good
    in every energetic motion.]</p>

    <p>Although I intended to write you more explicitly about what
    happened at home and to try to explain things as they seemed to
    me, although I wanted to speak to you about some other subjects
    too, I have no time for it now, and I think it better to write
    you about drawing again. I started at once a few smaller
    watercolours and also a large one, at least almost as large as
    one of those figure studies which I made at Etten. Now of
    course it doesn't all succeed right away. Mauve himself says
    that I shall spoil at least ten drawings before I know how to
    handle the brush well. But behind it is a better future, so I
    work with as much composure as I can, and am not disheartened
    even by my mistakes.</p>

    <p><art id=194_V-T_1700>This is a little sketch </art>of one of the smaller watercolours;
    it is a corner of my studio with a little girl grinding
    coffee.</p>

    <p>You see, I am seeking for tone, a head or little hand which
    has light and life in it, and which stands out against the
    drowsy dusk of the background, and then boldly against it all
    that part of the chimney and stove - iron and stone - and a
    wooden floor. If I could get the drawing as I want it, I would
    make three-fourths of it in a yellow-soap style, and would
    treat only the corner where the little girl sits tenderly,
    softly and with sentiment.</p>

    <p>You understand that I cannot express everything as I feel
    it, but the problem is to attack the difficulties; the
    yellow-soap part is not yet yellow-soapy enough, and, on the
    other hand, the tenderness is not tender enough.</p>

    <p>But at any rate I have hammered the sketch onto the paper,
    and the idea is expressed, and I think it a good one.</p>

    <p>Of course, one cannot master the technique in a day.</p>

    <p>This is <art id=910a>the subject of the large drawing</art>,
    but I made it in a hurry and <art id=194_V-T_1701>the sketch is horrible</art>.</p>

    <p>They tell me somebody came to see me today, I think Mr.
    Tersteeg. I hope so, for he has promised to come and I should
    like to talk with him about a few things.</p>

    <p>He said he would be back tomorrow morning.</p>

    <p>Theo, I have great trouble with models: I hunt for them, and
    when I find them, it is hard to get them to come to the studio;
    often they do not come at all. For instance, this morning a
    blacksmith's boy could not come because his father wanted me to
    pay a guilder an hour; of course I refused to do it. Tomorrow
    that old woman will sit for me again, but she could not come
    for three days.</p>

    <p>When I go out, I often make sketches in the soup kitchens or
    in <art id=909>the third-class waiting room</art>, and such places. But outside
    it is so deuced cold, especially for me, as I do not draw as
    quickly as the more advanced, and must finish my sketches in
    more detail if they are to be of any use.</p>

    <p>So you see that I do not sit idle, and for the present I
    think no more about Etten, but try to get rooted here. Of
    course the models cost a lot of money, and I must tell you that
    I also spend what is necessary for myself,
    <label content="food-and-drink.preference">though living as
    cheaply as possible. (I take my meals in the soup kitchen.) </label>Yet
    I hope you will not object to my going on.</p>

    <p>But I repeat what I already said in my last letter, let me
    know as nearly as possible what I can expect; and I wish you
    could make some arrangement with Mr. Tersteeg, so that in case
    of difficulties, I can go to him without any scruples. For my
    part, I promise you to work as hard as I can; but with models,
    for instance, whether I can work <i>full speed, half speed, or
    not at all</i> often depends on the money I have or haven't got
    in my pocket. So now I am making arrangements with a mother and
    her baby, but I am afraid it will be too expensive. Of course
    you understand that I like best to go full speed,
    but&hellip;well, you know what I mean. I must hold myself in
    until I have a little more scope and freedom.</p>

    <p>Write me soon, and do send me the money for February as
    early as possible, for I am quite sure I shall not have a cent
    left by that time. <label content="art.technique">Meanwhile I intend to go on making those
    little pen drawings, but in a style different from that of last
    summer's large one. Somewhat more fiercely and savagely.</label></p>

    <p><art id=194_V-T_1702>This is a little sketch of the Schenkweg, the view from my
    window.</art></p>

    <p>Well, adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
