  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It's Sunday again, and rainy as usual. We have had a gale
    too this week, and there are few leaves left on the trees. I
    can tell you, I'm glad the stove is burning. When I happened to
    arrange my drawings this morning, namely, the studies from the
    model which have been done since your visit (not counting the
    older studies or those I drew in my sketchbook), I counted
    about a hundred.</p>

    <p>I mention the number because I remember that you asked me
    during your visit if I had even more studies than the drawings
    you saw then. I do not know whether all painters, even those
    who look down on my work so much that they think it beneath
    their dignity to take the slightest notice of it, work harder
    than I do. Nor do I know if they know a better way than to work
    from the model, though, in my opinion, they do it too little;
    as I wrote you before, I cannot understand why they do not take
    more models. (Of course I do not mean people like Mauve and
    Isra&euml;ls - though the latter, in my opinion, sets a
    splendid example of always working with a model - but I mean
    more especially people like De Bock or Breitner.) I haven't
    seen the latter since I visited him in the hospital during his
    illness. By chance I heard a rumour that he had become a
    teacher of drawing at a high school; from himself I did not
    hear a single word.</p>

    <p>This week I had a letter from Rappard, who is also
    astonished at the behaviour of many painters here, and whose
    picture was refused for the Arti [a society of painters in
    Amsterdam] exhibition. I ask you, is it just that he and I are
    counted for nothing?</p>

    <p>For I assure you that he works hard. This summer he was in
    Drenthe, and after that he worked quite a while in the hospital
    for the blind in Utrecht. It was curious to hear him tell of
    some experiences which were almost the same as mine.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">Well, I often long for you, as I already wrote you. If I saw
    you more often, and if I could speak to you about my work, I
    should make more things, which I am sure might proceed from the
    studies I have.</label> But you remember that not long ago I wrote you
    (when sending you <art id=1091>a sketch in colour of a potato market</art>),
    &ldquo;I must try to paint the bustle of the streets
    again.&rdquo; The result if this is about twelve watercolours
    which I am doing right now, so I do <i>not</i> want to say that
    I cannot do anything with my studies or that I make them
    without a definite purpose, but only that I believe I could do
    <i>more</i> with them and make them more directly effective if
    I could sometimes consult you about it.</p>

    <p>But however that may be, I work with great pleasure these
    days, and I hope there will be some things among my pictures
    which will please you too when you come.</p>

    <p>I believe that if one wants to make figures, one must have a
    warm feeling, what Punch calls in its Christmas picture, Good
    will to all - that means one must have real love for one's
    fellow creatures. I for one hope to try my best to be in such a
    mood as much as possible.</p>

    <p>It is for just this reason that I am sorry not to have any
    intercourse with painters, and that, as I wrote you before, one
    cannot sit cosily together round a fire on a rainy day like
    today, looking at drawings or engravings and stimulating each
    other in this way.</p>

    <p>I must ask you something: Are there any cheap Daumier prints
    to be had, and, if so, which ones? I always found him very
    clever, but it is only recently that I have begun to have the
    impression that he is more important than I thought. If you
    know any particulars about him or if you have seen any of his
    important drawings, please tell me about it.</p>

    <p>I had seen some caricatures of his before now, and perhaps
    for that very reason had the wrong idea about him. His figures
    always impressed me, but I think I know only a very small
    portion of his work, and that, for instance, the caricatures
    are not at all the most representative or most important part
    of it.</p>

    <p>I remember we spoke about it last year on the road to
    Prinsenhage, and you said then that you liked Daumier better
    than Gavarni, and I took Gavarni's part, and told you about the
    book I had read about Gavarni which you have now. But I must
    say that since then, though I have not come to like Gavarni
    less, I begin to suspect that I know but a very small portion
    of Daumier's work and that the very things which would interest
    me most are <i>in the portion of his work which I do not
    know</i> (though I already greatly appreciate what I know of
    him). And I have a vague recollection, but I may be mistaken,
    that you spoke about large drawings, types or heads of people,
    and I am very curious to see them. If there were more things of
    his as beautiful as a print I found recently, &ldquo;Les 5 ages
    d'un buveur [the five ages of a drinker], or like that figure
    of an old man under a chestnut tree which I mentioned to you
    before - yes, then he would perhaps be the greatest of all. Can
    you perhaps give me some information about it?</p>

    <p>Do you remember the figures by De Groux from the
    &ldquo;Uilenspiegel,&rdquo; which I used to have but have lost,
    alas. Well, those two prints by Daumier just mentioned are like
    them, and if you can find more of them, those are what I mean
    (I care much less for the caricatures).</p>

    <p>I am awfully sorry that I don't have those De Groux and
    Ropses any more. I gave them away in England with some other
    things to Richardson, the travelling representative for Goupil
    &amp; Co.</p>

    <p>Well, my boy, one thing I can promise you against the time
    of your arrival, besides the watercolours and painted studies,
    I shall beg you to take the trouble of looking through a
    portfolio with a hundred drawings, all studies of figures. I
    already have them now, if I count some old ones in. But in the
    time between now and your arrival, I will try to make some
    better ones instead of those which are not good enough, and I
    will try to put some more variety into them. Goodbye, with all
    my heart I wish you some prosperity and happiness. Believe me,
    with a handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
