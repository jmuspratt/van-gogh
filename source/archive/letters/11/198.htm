  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Having received your letter of 13 May, which must have
    crossed a letter of mine to you, I find it necessary to explain
    a few things to you without delay.</p>

    <p>A great deal of what I read in your letter I certainly
    appreciate very much, for instance, `One must be narrow-minded
    or hypocritical to set one class without question above
    another.'</p>

    <p>The world, however, does not reason like that and never sees
    or respects man's `humanity' but only the greater or lesser
    value of the money or goods he carries with him so long as he
    is on this side of the grave. The world takes no account at all
    of what happens beyond the grave. That is why the world goes no
    further than its feet will take it.</p>

    <p>For my part, however, I feel sympathy or antipathy for men
    just as men, and their circumstances leave me relatively
    indifferent.</p>

    <p>Yet even I take some note (and were my own circumstances to
    <i>allow</i> me, I should make even further concessions) when
    you say, `There are many who maintain a certain social standing
    in order to avoid attention from others and lest people meddle
    too much in their affairs.' Very often, indeed, I let things
    pass, thinking, I'm not going to do or say this or that in case
    I give offence to somebody or other.</p>

    <p>But when it comes to important, serious maters one must act,
    not in accordance with l'opinion publique, not according to
    one's own passions, but following the ABC which is the basis of
    all morality: `Love thy neighbour as thyself.' Act in a way you
    can justify before God. Do the right thing and act loyally.</p>

    <p>Now, when it comes to Christien, this is my reasoning: how
    should I like it if someone first helped me and then left me in
    the lurch? Wouldn't I think&hellip;someone who behaves like
    that would have done better to have left me alone. If he
    doesn't finish what he started - he really has deceived me.</p>

    <p>The father of X<sup>tien</sup>`s [Christien's] child argued
    in the exact spirit of your letter, Theo, but in my opinion
    quite wrongly. He was very kind to her, but did not marry her,
    even when he had made her pregnant, for the sake, he said, of
    his position and his family, etc. X<sup>tien</sup> was young at
    the time and had met him after her father's death, didn't know
    then what she knows now, and when the man died there she was
    alone with her child - forsaken, without a penny. &Agrave;
    contrecoeur [reluctantly] went on the streets, became ill, was
    taken to hospital, in all sorts of trouble&hellip;</p>

    <p>That man's behaviour made him guilty before God, although in
    the eyes of the world he had kept up his position, `had paid
    her off.' But at the moment when he faced death, do you imagine
    he felt no regret and remorse???</p>

    <p>Now, in this world, the characters of people like him come
    up against characters like, say, mine. I care as little for the
    world as the aforesaid person cared for what is right. The
    semblance of doing right was enough for him. As for me, I
    wouldn't give you tuppence for the world's opinion. What comes
    first and foremost with me is this: <i>I will not deceive or
    forsake a woman</i>. If a woman refuses to have anything to do
    with me, like Kee Vos, I don't try to force her, no matter how
    strong my passion. I turn away with desolation in my heart the
    moment my own `she and no other' is met by her `certainly not
    him.'</p>

    <p><i>I will not force and I will not forsake</i>. And I, too,
    protest when I myself am forced or forsaken.</p>

    <p>If I were married to a woman and I realized that that woman
    was carrying on with another, I wouldn't stand for any
    nonsense, but even then I wouldn't forsake her before I had
    tried everything possible to bring her back. So you see what I
    think of marriage and that I take it seriously.</p>

    <p>Now as you know, when I met X<sup>tien</sup> she was
    pregnant, ill, left out in the cold. I was alone, and had just
    had the experience in Amsterdam I wrote to you about. I started
    it - though not immediately with marriage in mind. However,
    when I got to know her better, it became obvious to me that if
    I wanted to help her I must set about it more seriously.</p>

    <p>Then I spoke to her frankly and said, I think about this and
    that, in such and such a way, I see your position and mine in
    such and such a way. I am poor - but I am no seducer. Will you
    be able to put up with me? Otherwise there isn't any point in
    going on.</p>

    <p>At which she said, I want to be with you, no matter how poor
    you are.</p>

    <p>And that is how it all came about. And before very long now
    she will be going to Leyden and I should like to marry her
    without any fuss straight after that. Because otherwise there
    will be something false about her position and mine, which I
    most decidedly wish to avoid.</p>

    <p>I shall be like a workman with a trade in which she is my
    assistant. My drawings are in your hands and for the first year
    at least my bread and hers will depend on you and on all those
    who are willing to help me, because you can see that I am doing
    my best and that I have the gift of drawing, and I believe of
    painting as well, which little by little will become more
    evident.</p>

    <p>Now, Theo, I do not think I am disgracing my family by what
    I have done - and I wish my family would come to terms with it.
    Otherwise we will remain in opposite camps and I will have to
    declare: I will not forsake a woman to whom I am attached by a
    bond of mutual aid and respect in order to oblige anybody. I
    have come to terms with her past and she has come to terms with
    my past. If my family disowned me for seducing a woman and I
    had actually done it, then I should feel like a blackguard, but
    if I were to be opposed because I remained loyal to a woman to
    whom I had pledged my troth, I should despise my family.</p>

    <p>Not everyone is suited to be a <i>painter's</i> wife -
    <i>she is willing</i>, she learns something every day. I
    understand peculiarities in her character that have repelled
    others. But H. G. T. would probably think of her what he thinks
    of me, and say, `She has a disagreeable nature and there is
    something unattractive about her,' and there the matter would
    rest.</p>

    <p>But it goes without saying that I have enough knowledge of
    the world and of human nature to ask for nothing more than that
    people should not oppose my marriage - and I hope that I will
    not be wanting for my daily bread as long as I can show that I
    am doing my best and straining every nerve to become a good
    painter, or perhaps merely a draughtsman. I shall not be
    visiting my family or anything of the sort, however, either by
    myself or with her, but shall remain in the walk of life to
    which my work has allotted me. And then nobody can take
    offence, unless `men of iniquity should deliberately try to
    find a stumbling block,' which I trust will not be the
    case.</p>

    <p>However, you will find me most obliging in everything I am
    able to do without being disloyal to Christien. I should very
    much like to have your advice on, for instance, where I should
    live, and the like. If there is some objection to my remaining
    in The Hague, then I owe The Hague no loyalty. And I can find
    somewhere to work wherever you think fit, be it a village or a
    town. The figures and the landscape that come my way will no
    doubt always be interesting enough for me to do my best, so you
    are welcome to speak your mind freely on the subject. But it
    goes without saying that there must be no question of putting
    me under guardianship, I made my feelings concerning that
    perfectly clear during the Gheel affair: that sort of thing
    would be quite hors de saison [inopportune].</p>

    <p>But as far as being loyal or disloyal to Christien is
    concerned, my feeling is: `<i>I must not break a promise of
    marriage</i>.'</p>

    <p>Had Kee Vos been willing to listen to me last summer in
    Amsterdam, she might not have been so quick to send me packing
    and then things would have been quite different. At the time,
    however, as you know, although I followed her all the way,
    although I pursued her as far as Amsterdam, all my attempts to
    speak to her or to establish anything with a certainty -
    anything I could rely on, that is - proved futile.</p>

    <p>Now the very pace of life is driving and urging me on, as
    well as the work, and the new things that crop up and which I
    must tackle with a will if I want to hold my own in the bitter
    struggle. Taking things lying down is what I did in years gone
    by, taking action and being alert is what I do now, having
    found my work and my vocation.</p>

    <p>So I consider your letter in the main quite mistaken, but
    perhaps that is because you haven't thought things through, and
    I credit you with being better than that particular letter this
    morning suggests.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.mistress">You mention something that happened to you. I think I am
    able to recall something about it very faintly in the dim and
    distant past. If I remember rightly, you were acquainted with a
    girl from a lower class and &hellip; were fond of her and slept
    with her. Now I don't know who the person was, but I do know
    that you consulted Father about it and also spoke to me about
    it. And that Father then made you promise something about
    getting married, I don't know exactly what - but perhaps it was
    that while you remained a minor you would not do it without his
    consent. (The rest - what happened to the woman - I don't
    know.) Since you were a minor, Father had every right to step
    between the two of you and I can understand why he did it.</label></p>

    <p>Now the difference between your case and mine is that in the
    first place you and she were considerably younger than
    X<sup>tien</sup> and I, and secondly, your future and mine are
    different, that is, I for my part ply a humble trade and you
    hold a position which of necessity requires you to keep up a
    certain style.</p>

    <p>This is all clear enough, it seems to me, and also that
    being a minor you were right to obey, while I for my part,
    being of age, am at liberty to say to Father: this is a matter
    in which you cannot and must not press me.</p>

    <p>Now, you say that what has happened between X<sup>tien</sup>
    and me does not mean I have to marry her. This is what
    X<sup>tien</sup> and I think about it: we both want a very
    domesticated life, close together, <i>need each other every day
    for our work and like to be together every day</i>. We want
    there to be nothing false in our position and consider marriage
    the only radical means of stopping the world talking and of
    seeing to it that we are not &hellip; reproached with an
    illicit relationship. If we do not get married, they could
    indeed say that something or other is wrong - if we do get
    married we shall be very poor and give up any social pretenses,
    but our action will be right and honourable. You will
    understand this, I think.</p>

    <p>But if you should now say, `Vincent, you're going to have a
    dreadful time and terrible worries,' then what I shall reply
    is, yes. Brother, I'm well aware of that, you are right, but,
    my dear fellow, what I would find even worse would be the
    feeling deep down inside of: `You have treacherously abandoned
    that woman whom you met in the winter, pregnant and sick, and
    have thrown her back on to the cruel cobblestones once more.'
    That is not going to be said about me, and you will realize by
    now that it isn't `obstinacy' on my part or `wantonly having it
    my own way,' but that I must stand by X<sup>tien</sup>, that I
    have pledged her my troth and that I shall keep my pledge.</p>

    <p>Once again, if my staying in The Hague should bother anyone,
    please say so frankly, I am only too happy to yield on all
    matters concerning a home or the like. I need a studio, a
    living room and a bedroom, and though I am not indifferent as
    to whether that will be in The Hague or elsewhere, I shall be
    happy to show willing. However it must all be discussed quite
    differently from, for example, the way Father did on the Gheel
    occasion. That was scandalous.</p>

    <p>Should it be possible for me to have, say, 50 frs. a month
    this year (although my work still isn't saleable yet, it is the
    foundation on which I shall be able to build later on) - then I
    shall get down to business with a will and in good heart,
    because I shall at least know then that I shan't be lacking the
    barest necessities I require for my work - my daily bread, a
    home, drawing materials - <i>I shall be able</i> to work
    then.</p>

    <p>Were I to be told for certain that you are withdrawing your
    support, I should be rendered powerless. With the best will in
    the world my hand would become paralysed - everything would
    indeed be dreadful then, yes, everything would be terrible.
    What satisfaction would that give you or anyone else? I should
    become downhearted and it would go hard with Christien and the
    child. You may think it's going too far to suppose you capable
    of doing anything like that, but `<i>such things can
    happen.</i>' If this dreadful fate has to befall me - so be it.
    Though it hangs over my head, I can say nothing other than: I
    have pledged X<sup>tien</sup> my troth and she has pledged me
    hers, and we do not have it in us to break this pledge.</p>

    <p>And yet - confound it - what's happening? - and what sort of
    times do we live in? - wake up, Theo! Don't let them confuse
    you or sway you with their Jesuitisms. Do I deserve being left
    in the lurch by you because I have helped a pregnant woman and
    will not send her back on to the streets? Is that a capital
    offence???</p>

    <p>Goodbye, my dear fellow, but before you strike at me and
    chop off my head, <i>and X</i><sup><i>tien</i></sup> <i>`s and
    the child's as well</i> - sleep on it once more. But again, if
    it has to be, then in God's name `off with my head,' though
    preferably not, I still need it for drawing.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>P. S. X<sup>tien</sup> and the child won't be able to pose
    <i>headless</i> either.</p>
