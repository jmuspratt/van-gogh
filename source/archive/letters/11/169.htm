    <p>[Letterhead Goupil &amp; Cie., Paris. Letter from Theo to
    Vincent.]</p>

    <p>[Vincent's handwriting] Please don't think I'm sending your
    letter back to offend you, I simply believe this is the
    quickest way of answering it clearly. And if you didn't have
    your own letter to hand, you might not be able to understand
    quite so well what my answer refers to. Now the numbers will
    guide you. I'm short of time, I'm still expecting a model
    today.</p>

    <p>[Theo's handwriting]</p>

    <p>Paris, 5 January 1882</p>

    <p>My dear Vincent,</p>

    <p>I have received your two letters and thank you for keeping
    me in the picture. I think it is a very good thing that you
    have settled permanently in The Hague and hope to do as much as
    I can to help you out until you can start earning your own
    money. But what I do not approve of is the way in which you
    contrived to leave Father and Mother, (1)</p>

    <p>That you could not bear it there is possible and that you
    should differ in your views from people who have lived in the
    country all their lives and who have had no chance of
    participating in modern life, is only too natural, but what the
    devil made you so childish and so shameless as to embitter
    Father and Father's life and render it almost impossible by
    setting about things in the way you did? (2) It isn't hard to
    fight with someone who is already weary. (3)</p>

    <p>When Father wrote to me about it, I thought it must be a
    misunderstanding, but you yourself say in your letter,
    &ldquo;As far as the relationship between Father and me is
    concerned, it will not be remedied in a hurry.&rdquo; (4) Don't
    you know him then, and don't you realize that Father cannot
    live while there is all this bickering between the two of you?
    (5) Co&ucirc;te que co&ucirc;te [at all costs], you <i>are in
    duty bound</i> to ensure that matters are put right and I
    guarantee that one day you will be extremely sorry for having
    been so callous in this matter. (6)</p>

    <p>It is Mauve who attracts you at the moment, and, carried
    away as usual, you find anyone who is not like him
    objectionable, because you look for the same qualities in
    everybody. (7) Is it not a bitter pill for Father to swallow to
    see himself belittled by someone who claims to be more of a
    freethinker, (8) and whom, au fond [deep down], he possibly
    envies from time to time for his clearer insights? (9) Does his
    life count for nothing then? (10) I don't understand you. (11)
    Write to me again when you can (12) and give my regards to
    Mauve and Jet.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Theo</p>

    <p>[Vincent's handwriting]</p>

    <p>7 or 8 January 1882</p>

    <p>Because I have only a little time to spare, I can think of
    no better means of replying to your letter than by doing it in
    this way, answering your points one by one in orderly
    sequence.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li value="1">
        <p>I did not `contrive' anything, on the contrary, when
        Father was here, Mauve, Father and I talked about my
        renting a studio in Etten - spending the winter there - and
        returning to The Hague in the spring. Because of the models
        and because I had settled down to my work in Etten and had
        begun to make headway.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>That does not alter the fact that I should have liked to
    prolong my stay in The Hague a bit more, seeing that I was here
    already, but it was nevertheless my definite intention to
    continue my studies of the Brabant peasant types. And when my
    plans were thwarted, after they had been discussed with M. and
    I had already entered into correspondence with him about the
    studio in question (a shed in need of some repair), I could no
    longer contain my anger.</p>

    <p>Do you recall a letter I wrote to you in which I expanded at
    some length on my plan to continue those studies? I mean the
    letter in which I asked you to impress upon Father and Mother
    once more in plain terms that working in Etten was of the
    greatest importance to me, etc. I remember the way I put it: it
    would be too bad if, because of a whim of Father's, I had to
    abandon work that had begun to make headway and on which I had
    been engaged for months. Give it some thought yourself -
    despite Mauve's help I am in much more of a fix here than at
    home, and I'll be blowed if I know how I am going to get
    through it.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li value="2">
        <p>The reproach that I set about embittering Father's and
        Mother's life is not really your own. I know it, and of
        old, as one of Father's Jesuitisms and have told Father,
        and Mother too, that I considered it to be a Jesuitism and
        that I didn't take the slightest notice of it.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Whenever one says something to Father to which he has no
    reply, he comes out with a reproach of that sort and says, for
    example, &ldquo;You will be the death of me,&rdquo; while he
    sits there perfectly calmly reading his newspaper and smoking
    his pipe. So I take such reproaches for what they are.</p>

    <p>Or else Father flies into an enormous rage, is used to
    people being frightened by it and is astonished when somebody
    does not give way before his anger.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.father">Father is extremely touchy and irritable and obstinate in
    domestic affairs and is used to having his way. And the heading
    `the rules and regulations of this house', with which I am
    obliged to comply, includes literally anything that comes into
    Father's head.</label></p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li value="3">
        <p>It's easy enough to fight with an old man, etc. Because
        Father is an old man, I have spared his feelings a hundred
        times and tolerated things that are little short of
        intolerable. Anyway, there wasn't any fighting this time
        either, but just an &ldquo;enough!&rdquo; And because he
        wouldn't listen to reason and common sense, I spoke
        straight out and it can only be to the good that for once
        Father should have heard a few home truths expressed that
        others too think now and then.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="4">
        <p>That it will not be remedied in a hurry. For the sake of
        appearances I have put matters straight by writing to
        Father again and telling him that I have rented a studio,
        that I wished him a happy New Year, and that I hoped we
        would have no more quarrels of this or any other kind in
        that New Year. I shall do no more about it, nor do I need
        to. If this last row had been an isolated case then it
        would be a different matter, but it was preceded by other
        rows, yet whenever I told Father a few things in a calmer
        though still resolute way, His Honour would fling it all
        systematically to the winds. So as far as the things I have
        said in anger are concerned, I think the same even in a
        calmer mood, though for diplomatic reasons I have usually
        kept quiet about them or put them differently. But this
        time I lost my temper, my diplomacy went by the board, and
        well, for once I had my say. I offer no apology for that
        and while Father and Mother continue in this mood I shall
        take nothing back. Should they later behave in a more
        humane, more sensitive and more sincere way, then I shall
        be happy to take everything back. But I doubt if that will
        happen.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="5">
        <p>That Father and Mother cannot live while there is all
        this bickering going on, etc., that's true, in so far as
        they are creating a desert around themselves and are
        earning themselves an unhappy old age when they could have
        a happy and contented one. But as to such expressions as
        &ldquo;I cannot bear it&rdquo;, &ldquo;it's killing
        me&rdquo;, &ldquo;my life is embittered&rdquo;, I no longer
        attach any importance to them, for that's only their little
        way. And if they do not change, then, as I have already
        said, I'm afraid they are storing up many bad and lonely
        days for themselves.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="6">
        <p>That I shall be sorry, etc. Before things came to their
        present pass, I used to have many regrets and be very sad
        and reproach myself because things between Father and
        Mother and me were going so badly. But now that matters
        have gone this far, well, so be it, and to tell you the
        truth, I have no regrets anymore, cannot help feeling a
        sense of deliverance. If I should later come to see that I
        did wrong, well, then I shall of course be sorry, but as it
        is I have been unable to see how else I could possibly have
        acted. When somebody tells me decisively, &ldquo;Get out of
        my house, the sooner the better, in half an hour rather
        than an hour,&rdquo; well then, my dear fellow, it doesn't
        take a quarter of an hour for me to leave, never to return
        either. That was going too far, and you surely understand
        that, if only to spare you and others further financial
        trouble, I should not lightly have left on my own accord,
        but once that &ldquo;Get out&rdquo; has been said, by them
        and not by me, well then, my course is clear enough.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="7">
        <p>As for Mauve - yes indeed, I am very fond of M. and am
        in sympathy with him. I love his work - and I count myself
        fortunate to be learning from him, but I can no more
        withdraw into some system or school than Mauve can himself,
        and apart from Mauve and Mauve's work, I also love others
        who are quite different and work quite differently. And as
        for myself and my own work, perhaps there is a similarity
        between us at times, but there is certainly a difference as
        well. If I love someone or something, then I do so in
        earnest and sometimes with real passion and fire, but that
        doesn't make me think as a matter of course that only a few
        people are perfect and all the others worthless - far from
        it</p>
      </li>

      <li value="8">
        <p>Freethinker, that is really a word I detest, although I
        have to use it occasionally faute de mieux [for want of
        anything better]. The fact is that I do my best to think
        things through and try in my actions to take account of
        reason and common sense. And trying to belittle someone
        would be quite contrary to that. So it is perfectly true
        that on occasion I have said to Father, &ldquo;Do try to
        think this or that through,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;To my mind,
        this or that does not stand up,&rdquo; but that is not
        trying to belittle someone. I am not Father's enemy if I
        tell him the truth for a change, not even that time I lost
        my temper and did so in salty language. Only it did no
        good, and Father took it amiss.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p><label content="attitude.clergy">In case Father refers to my saying that, ever since I have
    acquired so much dessous les cartes, I haven't given two pins
    for the morality and the religious system of the clergy and
    their academic ideas, then I absolutely refuse to take that
    back, for I truly mean it.</label> It is just that when I am in a calm
    mood, I don't talk about it, although it is a different matter
    when they try to force me to go to church, for instance, or to
    attach importance to doing so, for then I naturally tell them
    that it is completely out of the question.</p>

    <p>(10) [<i>sic</i>] Does father's life count for nothing? I
    have already said that when I hear someone say, &ldquo;You will
    be the death of me,&rdquo; while in the meantime that man is
    reading his paper and half a minute later is talking about
    goodness knows what advertisement or other, I consider that
    phrase fairly irrelevant and superfluous and take no notice of
    it. As soon as that kind of phrase is repeated to others, who
    are then going to consider me more or less a murderer or even a
    parricide, I say, these slanders are nothing more nor less than
    Jesuitisms. There you are. Anyway, the murderer has left the
    house now, and so, in short, I take not the slightest notice of
    any of it and even consider it ridiculous.</p>

    <p>(11) You say, &ldquo;I don't understand you.&rdquo; Well, I
    readily believe that, for writing is really a wretched way of
    explaining things to each other. And it takes up a great deal
    of time and you and I have a great deal to do as it is. But we
    must have a little patience with each other until we can see,
    and speak to each other.</p>

    <p>(12) Write to me again. Yes, of course, but first we must
    agree how. Would you like me to write in a kind of businesslike
    style, dry and formal, weighing my words carefully and actually
    saying nothing at all? Or would you like me to continue to
    write as I have done recently, telling you all the thoughts
    that come into my head, without being afraid of rambling on now
    and then, without censoring my thoughts or holding them back?
    That's what I would prefer - that is, being free to write or
    say exactly what I mean.</p>

    <p>So much for my direct answer to your letter, but I still
    have some things to say to you about drawing, etc., etc., and I
    would sooner talk about that. Consider it a point in my favour
    that for the time being I am behaving as if Father and Mother
    did not exist. It would have been much better if I had spent
    this winter in Etten, and things would have been much easier
    for me, too, especially for financial reasons - if I were to
    start thinking and fretting about that again, it would make me
    melancholy, so that's over and done with, once and for all. I
    am here now and I must try to muddle through. If I wrote to
    Father about it again, it would be adding fuel the fire. I
    don't ever want to get angry again and am throwing myself with
    might and main into life and affairs here, and, what can I do,
    Etten is lost and so is Heike, but I shall try to obtain
    something else in their stead.</p>

    <p>&mdash;</p>

    <p>Let me now thank you warmly for what you sent me, I don't
    need to add that I am still extremely anxious in spite of it.
    Of course my expenses are greater than in Etten and I cannot
    get down to work half as energetically as I should like and
    should be able to if I had greater resources.</p>

    <p>But my studio is turning out well. I wish you could see it
    sometime. I have hung up all my studies and you must send me
    back those you still have because they could still be useful to
    me. They may not be saleable and I readily acknowledge all
    their faults, but there is something of nature in them because
    they were done with some passion.</p>

    <p>And you know, I am toiling away at watercolours right now
    and when I have got my hand in, they will be saleable. But
    Theo, believe me, when I went to Mauve for the first time with
    my pen drawings and M. said, &ldquo;Now try it with charcoal
    and crayon and stump,&rdquo; I had the devil of a job working
    with that new material. I was patient, but that didn't seem to
    help, then I grew so impatient at times that I would stamp on
    my charcoal and become utterly dejected. And yet, a little
    while later, I sent you drawings done with chalk and charcoal
    and the brush, and I went back to Mauve with a whole lot of
    similar ones, in which, naturally, he found something to
    criticize, and with reason, and you did as well, it was a step
    forward.</p>

    <p>Now I am once again passing through a similar period of
    struggle and dejection, of patience and impatience, of hope and
    despair. But I have to struggle on and, well, in good time I
    shall understand watercolours better. If it were easy, there
    would be no pleasure in it. And ditto, ditto with painting.</p>

    <p>Added to this, the weather is inclement so that I have yet
    to go out just for the fun of it this winter. Still, I am
    enjoying life, and in particular having a studio of my own is
    too glorious for words. When are you coming to have some tea or
    coffee with me? Soon, I hope. You can spend the night too, if
    necessary - how very nice and how enjoyable. And I even have
    some flowers too, a few small bowls of bulbs.</p>

    <p>And what's more, I have obtained yet another ornament for my
    studio. I got an amazing bargain of splendid woodcuts from the
    Graphic, in part printed, not from the clich&eacute;s, but from
    the blocks themselves. Just what I've been looking for for
    years. Drawings by Herkomer, Frank Holl, Walker and others. I
    bought them from Blok the Jewish bookseller, and for five
    guilders picked the best from an enormous pile of Graphics and
    London News. They include some superb things, for instance, <art id=ildes>the
    Houseless and Homeless by Fildes (poor people waiting outside a
    night shelter)</art> and two large Herkomers and many small ones, and
    the Irish emigrants by Frank Holl and the `Old gate' by Walker,
    and above all a girls' school by Frank Holl, and then another
    large Herkomer, The Invalids.</p>

    <p>Anyway, it's just the stuff I need.</p>

    <p>And I keep such beautiful things at home with some
    contentment because, my dear fellow, although I am still a long
    way from doing anything as beautiful myself, I have
    nevertheless hung a few of my studies of old peasants, etc., on
    the wall, which proves that my enthusiasm for those artists is
    not mere vanity, but that I struggle and strive to make
    something myself that is realistic and yet done with
    feeling.</p>

    <p>I've got about 12 figures of diggers and people working in
    the potato field, and I wonder if I couldn't do something with
    them. You still have a few of them, for instance a man putting
    potatoes into a sack. Well, I'm not sure when, but sooner or
    later I must get down to that, because last summer I made some
    careful observations, and here in the dunes I should be able to
    do a good study of the earth and the sky and then put in the
    figures boldly. Still, I'm not setting too much store by these
    studies, and hope, of course, to do something quite different
    and better, but the Brabant types are characteristic, and who
    knows whether they can't still be used to good account. If
    there are any you would like to keep, feel at liberty to do so,
    but I should be very glad to have back those in which you are
    not interested. By studying new models I will automatically
    discover the mistakes in proportion I made in last summer's
    studies, and so they may yet prove useful to me.</p>

    <p>When your letter took so long to come (since it went to
    Mauve first, I received it even later) I had to go to Mr.
    Tersteeg, and he gave me 25 guilders until I received your
    letter. It might be a good idea if I, with your knowledge, or
    you, with my knowledge, made some sort of arrangement with Mr.
    T. For you realize, Theo, I must know with as much certainty as
    possible what to expect, and I must be able to calculate and be
    able to tell in advance whether I can do this or that or must
    give it up. So you will do me a great favour by agreeing with
    me to a definite arrangement, and I hope you will write to me
    about it soon.</p>

    <p>Mauve has promised me to put my name forward immediately as
    an associate member of Pulchri [the artists' society and
    headquarters of the Hague school], because I shall then be able
    to draw from the model there 2 evenings a week and shall have
    more contact with artists. Then as soon as possible after that
    I shall become a full member. Well, my dear fellow, thanks for
    what you sent, and believe me, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
