  <body>
    <p>Amice Rappard,</p>

    <p>Your very welcome letter came to hand a minute ago, and as I
    am longing for another chat with you, I am answering it at
    once.</p>

    <p>You write, &ldquo;Have you many German things?&rdquo; As it
    happens, I wrote in a letter to my brother, with reference to
    some figure studies I had done, practically exactly the same
    things about Vautier and some other Germans as you do. I told
    him I had been to an exhibition of watercolours where there
    were a good many things by Italians. Clever, very clever - and
    yet they left me with a feeling of emptiness, and I told my
    brother, Old fellow, what jolly times those were when that
    artists' club in the Alsace was started: Vautier, Knaus, Jundt,
    Georg Saal, Van Muyden, <i>Brion</i><i>,</i> and especially
    Anker and Th. Schuler, who mostly did drawings that were, one
    might say, explained and propped up by artists of another kind,
    namely such writers as Erckmann-Chatrian and Auerbach. Oh,
    certainly, these Italians are very clever, but where is their
    sentiment, their human feeling? I would rather see a little
    grey sketch by Lan&ccedil;on - some rag pickers eating
    <sup>1</sup> soup, while outside it is raining or snowing -
    than those brilliant peacock's feathers by those Italians - who
    seem to multiply daily, whereas the soberer artists remain just
    as rare as always.</p>

    <p>I mean it, Rappard, I would just as soon be a waiter in a
    hotel, for instance, than the kind of watercolour manufacturer
    some of those Italians are.</p>

    <p>I do not say this of all of them, but I am sure you will
    feel as I do about the trend and the purpose of this school.
    What I say does not imply that I do not appreciate many of them
    - I mean such artists as have something Goya-esque about them,
    for instance Fortuny in some things, and Morelli, and at times
    even Tapero, etc. - further Heilbuth, Zues. Some ten or twelve
    years ago - I was with Goupil then - I saw these things for the
    first time; I thought them splendid, and I admired them even
    more than the elaborate things by the German or English
    artists, for instance Rochussen or Mauve. But I changed my mind
    a long time ago, because I think these artists are a bit like
    birds that can sing only one note, and I happen to be feeling
    more sympathy for larks and nightingales that tell us more with
    less noise and more passion. For all that, I don't have many
    things by the Germans - the fine things of Brion's time are
    hard to find now.</p>

    <p>At the time I made a collection of wood engravings,
    particularly after the artists mentioned above, but I gave it
    away to a friend in England when I left Goupil. Now I am mighty
    sorry I did. If you want something very beautiful, then order
    from the offices of L'Illustration<i>:</i> l'Album des Vosges,
    dessin&eacute; de Th. Schuler, Brion, Valentin, Jundt, etc.; I
    think the price is 5 francs, but I am afraid it might be sold
    out. At any rate it is worth inquiring. It is even probable
    that the price has been raised now - they won't send it for
    inspection, so I did not venture to inquire myself.</p>

    <p>I know only a few particulars about English black-and-white
    artists, by which I mean that I could not give a biography of
    any of them. But generally speaking, as I lived in England for
    fully three years, I learned much about them and their work by
    seeing a lot of what they did. Without having been in England
    for a long time it is hardly possible to appreciate them to the
    full.</p>

    <p>They have quite another way of feeling, conceiving,
    expressing themselves, to which one must get used to begin with
    - but I assure you it is worth the trouble to study them, for
    they are great artists, these Englishmen. Isra&euml;ls, Mauve
    and Rochussen come nearest to them - all the same the aspect of
    a picture by Thomas Faed, for instance, is greatly different
    from one by Isra&euml;ls; and a drawing by Pinwell, Morris or
    Small looks different from one by Mauve; and a Gilbert or du
    Maurier is different from a Rochussen.</p>

    <p>Speaking of Rochussen, I saw a marvelous drawing by him:
    French generals in a room of an old Dutch town hall, demanding
    information and papers from the burgomaster and the town
    councilors. I thought it just as beautiful as, for instance,
    that scene in Dr. Wagner's house in Madame
    Th&eacute;r&egrave;se by Erckmann-Chatrian. I know that at one
    time you did not appreciate Rochussen very much, but I feel
    sure that, when you see his important drawings, you will like
    him quite a lot.</p>

    <p>For me the English black-and-white artists are to art what
    Dickens is to literature. They have exactly the same sentiment,
    noble and healthy, and one always returns to them. I greatly
    wish you had the opportunity some time to look over my whole
    collection at leisure. <i>You gain an insight, particularly
    from seeing many of them together, and the work begins to speak
    for itself, and you see clearly what a splendid whole this
    school of artists forms</i> <i>-</i> just as one must read the
    whole of Dickens or of Balzac or of Zola to understand their
    books separately.</p>

    <p>For instance, at present I have no less than fifty sheets
    about Ireland. Separately one might easily overlook them; but
    as soon as one sees them together, one is struck by them.</p>

    <p>I do not know the portrait of Shakespeare by Menzel, but I'd
    very much like to see how one lion understood the other. For
    Menzel's work has this much in common with Shakespeare's, that
    it is so intensely <i>alive</i><i>.</i> I have the small
    edition by Fred and the big one by Menzel. Please bring
    Shakespeare's picture along next time you come to The
    Hague.</p>

    <p>I haven't got the prints you write about, except
    R&eacute;gamey, Heilbuth and Marchetti; I haven't got Jacquet
    either.</p>

    <p>I haven't anything by Whistler, but at the time I saw some
    beautiful etchings of his, figure and landscape.</p>

    <p>The marines by Wyllie in the Graphic<i>,</i> about which you
    write, struck me too. I know the &ldquo;Widow's Field&rdquo; by
    Boughton; it is very beautiful. My mind is so occupied by all
    this that I am organizing my whole life so as to do the things
    of everyday life that Dickens describes and the artists I've
    mentioned draw. Millet says, &ldquo;Dans l'art - <i>il faut y
    mettre sa peau&rdquo;</i> - yes, art demands the sacrifice of
    the whole man. I have engaged in the struggle, I know what I
    want, and drivel about what is called &ldquo;the illustrative&rdquo;
    cannot mislead me. My intercourse with artists has stopped
    almost completely, without my being able to explain precisely
    how and why this has come about. All kinds of eccentric and bad
    things are thought and said about me, which makes me feel
    somewhat forlorn now and then, but on the other hand it
    concentrates my attention on the things that never change -
    that is to say, the eternal beauty of nature. Often I think of
    the old story of Robinson Crusoe, who did not lose courage in
    his isolation, but managed to create a round of activities for
    himself so that through his own seeking and toiling his life
    became very active and animated.</p>

    <p>Well - of late I have also been painting and doing
    watercolours, and further I am doing a lot of figure drawing
    after the model and making sketches in the street. Besides, I
    have rather often had a man from the almshouse posing for
    me.</p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">Now it is really high time I returned Karl Robert's Le
    fusain to you. I have read it through more than once, but
    fusain [charcoal] does not come easily to me, and I prefer to
    work with a carpenter's pencil. I wish I could see someone
    doing a fusain - with me it becomes overdone so rapidly, and
    this must be caused by something that, I think, might be
    overcome when I saw someone else doing it. Next time you come
    I'll have to ask you a number of things about it.</label></p>

    <p>All the same I'm glad I've read it, and I quite agree with
    the author that it is splendid material to work with, and I
    greatly wish I knew how to use it better.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I shall find out someday, together with a number of
    other things that are still obscure to me.</p>

    <p>So I am returning it with many thanks. I am including some
    wood engravings - among which there are two German ones by
    Marchal. I think the Lan&ccedil;ons beautiful, and especially
    the one by Green and &ldquo;The Miners.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>If you have duplicates, please remember to send them to
    me.</p>

    <p>And the same holds true with regard to letters. And if you
    read something that strikes you, please let me know it too, for
    I am practically uninformed about what is being published
    nowadays - I know something more of the literature of some
    years ago. When I was ill and afterward I read Zola's books
    with great admiration. I thought Balzac unique, but now I see
    that he has successors. But all the same, Rappard, that time
    of Balzac and Dickens, that time of Gavarni and Millet - how
    far away it is. For though it isn't so long since these men
    passed away, yet it's a long, long time <i>since they
    began</i>, and since then many changes have taken place which
    in my opinion are not exactly changes for the better. Once I
    read in Eliot, &ldquo;Though it be dead, I think of it all as
    alive.&rdquo; To my mind the same may be said of the period I
    am writing about. And that is why I am so very fond of
    Rochussen, for instance. You are speaking of the illustration
    of fairy tales - do you know that Rochussen did some splendid
    watercolours of scenes out of German legends? I know a series
    called Lenore - brilliant of sentiment. But Rochussen's
    important drawings are not much in circulation; they are to be
    found, rather, in the portfolios of wealthy collectors. As soon
    as you put a little vigour into collecting wood engravings you
    are sure to hear some learned drivel about &ldquo;the
    illustrative.&rdquo; But what is happening to the wood
    engravings? - the beautiful ones are getting scarcer and
    scarcer, and more and more difficult to get hold of, and
    eventually people who are hunting for them will no longer be
    able to find them. The other day I saw a complete set of
    Dor&eacute;'s pictures of London. I tell you it is superb, and
    noble in sentiment - for instance that room in the &ldquo;Night
    Shelter for Beggars&rdquo; - I think you have it, or else you
    will be able to get it.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>Among other things I am working on a watercolour of orphans
    <sup>2</sup> - and I have started many other things - so I am
    very busy.</p>

    <p>When I had finished this letter, I went out and came back
    with another batch of illustrations, namely from the old Dutch
    Illustration<i>,</i> so that I can add a few more duplicates to
    the little package.</p>

    <p>In the first place three very fine Daumiers, and one Jacque.
    If you have them already, then please return them to me
    sometime.</p>

    <p>I have always thought &ldquo;The Four Ages of a
    Drinker&rdquo; by Daumier one of the most beautiful things.
    There is as much soul in it as in a De Groux. I am very glad to
    be able to send you this sheet; the Daumiers are getting
    scarce.</p>

    <p>Even if you had nothing else by Daumier than this one, the
    master would still be well represented in your collection. At
    the time I certainly saw splendid drawings by Frans Hals, and
    in this particular sheet I found something - aye,
    <i>everything</i> - of Frans Hals and Rembrandt.</p>

    <p>Further, I am including extremely fine Morins and old
    Dor&eacute;s - sheets that are becoming scarcer and scarcer and
    scarcer.</p>

    <p>Of course you have heard, like myself, a lot of cheap talk -
    with regard to &ldquo;the illustrative&rdquo; - aimed at
    Dor&eacute; - and of course at Morin too. But I believe that,
    notwithstanding this, you still like the work of these artists
    - and yet, unless one is on guard, such things may influence
    one. Therefore, now that I am sending you these sheets, I don't
    think it superfluous to tell you that I find in these soiled
    wood engravings a certain flavour of the days of Gavarni, and
    of Balzac and Victor Hugo - something of the now almost
    forgotten <i>Boh&egrave;me</i> - for which I feel a deep
    respect, and which, every time I see them again, stimulates me
    to do my best and to attack things energetically.</p>

    <p>Of course I too see the difference between a drawing by
    Dor&eacute; and one by Millet, but the one does not exclude the
    other.</p>

    <p>There is a difference, but there is also a resemblance.
    Dor&eacute; can model a torso and put together the joints
    better, infinitely better, than many who revile him with
    pedantic self-conceit - witness that one sheet which to him was
    no more than a rough sketch of sea bathers.</p>

    <p>I say that, if somebody like Millet had criticized
    Dor&eacute;s drawing - I doubt if he would ever have done it,
    but suppose he had - well, then he would have had a
    <i>right</i> to do so; but when those who with their ten
    fingers cannot do a tenth of what Dor&eacute; can do with a
    single finger revile his work, then it is nothing but humbug,
    and it would be more appropriate if they held their tongues and
    learned to draw better themselves.</p>

    <p>It is so ridiculous that nowadays this non-appreciation of
    drawing should be such a general phenomenon.</p>

    <p>Surely you saw in Brussels the drawings by Lynen - how witty
    and funny and clever they were; if you spoke about them to one
    of the fellows, he would answer arrogantly and with a certain
    disdain, Oh yes, they were &ldquo;rather nice.&rdquo; This
    Lynen himself, for instance, will probably always be a poor
    man, though it is quite likely that he is very active and
    productive, and will become more and more so. Well, speaking
    for myself - provided I remain active and productive too - as
    long as I may have my daily bread, I shall not mind being
    relatively poor all my life.</p>

    <p>Well, goodbye once more; I hope you will like the wood
    engravings and that I shall hear from you soon. Adieu.</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>
