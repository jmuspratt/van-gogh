  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is New Year's Eve and I want another chat with you.</p>

    <p>When I wrote my last letter, I spoke of some large heads I
    was working on. At that time I was busy making an experiment of
    which I can tell you the initial outcome, as I had models for
    two drawings the day before yesterday, yesterday and today.</p>

    <p><label content="art.technique">When I made the lithographs, it struck me that the
    lithographic crayon was very pleasant material, and l thought,
    I'll make drawings with it.</p>

    <p>However, there is one drawback which you will understand -
    as it is greasy, it cannot be erased in the usual way; working
    with it on paper, one even loses the only thing with which one
    can erase on the stone itself, namely the scraper - which
    cannot be used strongly enough on the paper because it cuts
    through it.</label></p>

    <p><label content="art.materials">But it occurred to me to make a drawing first with
    carpenter's pencil and then to work in and over it with
    lithographic crayon, which (because of the greasiness of the
    material) fixes the pencil, a thing ordinary crayon does not
    do, or, at least, does very badly. After doing a sketch in this
    way, one can, with a firm hand, use the lithographic crayon
    where it is necessary, without much hesitation or erasing. So I
    finished my drawings pretty well in pencil, indeed, as much as
    possible. Then I fixed them, and dulled them with milk. And
    then I worked it up again with lithographic crayon where the
    deepest tones were, retouched them here and there with a brush
    or pen, with lampblack, and worked in the lighter parts with
    white body colour.</label></p>

    <p>In this way I made a drawing of <art id=1001>an old man sitting reading,
    with the light falling on his bald head, on his hand and the
    book</art>. And the second one, <art id=1003>the bandaged head of
    an injured man.</art> The model who sat for this really had a head
    injury and a bandage over his left eye. Just
    like a head, for instance, of a soldier, of the old guard in
    the retreat from Russia.</p>

    <p>Now when I compare these two heads with the others I have
    done, there is a great difference in the power of effect. So I
    hope that the drawings done this way will lend themselves to
    reproduction by the process which you described to me.
    Especially if the paper you sent is not absolutely necessary
    for the reproduction.</p>

    <p>And if it is, I should be more apt to get a better than a
    worse effect on this grey paper with the same ingredients. When
    I looked at what Buhot had scratched on one of the samples, I
    saw at once that the black was of a very deep tone, and I can
    understand that this is a real necessity for the reproduction
    where photography and galvanography are used. So I at once
    began to try to find what kind of black to use and still stick
    to my usual way of sketching.</p>

    <p>First I tried it with ink, but that didn't satisfy me;
    however, I think that with the lithographic-crayon method the
    results will be better.</p>

    <p>Well, I am not writing about it to worry you during your
    busy days; I am in no hurry for it, and am even very glad to
    have a little time for additional experiments.</p>

    <p>But I am writing you about it so that you may know I am
    working heart and soul on it to get a good and useful result.
    What is called Black and White is in fact <i>painting in
    black</i>, meaning that one gives the same depth of
    effect, the same richness of tone value in a drawing that ought
    to be in a painting.</p>

    <p>Some time ago you rightly said that every colourist has his
    own characteristic scale of colours.</p>

    <p>This is also the case with Black and White, it is the same
    after all - one must be able to go from the highest light to
    the deepest shadow, and this with only a few simple
    ingredients. Some artists have a nervous hand at drawing, which
    gives their technique something of the sound peculiar to a
    violin, for instance, Lemud, Daumier, Lan&ccedil;on - others,
    for example, Gavarni and Bodmer, remind one more of piano
    playing. Do you feel this too? - Millet is perhaps a stately
    organ.</p>

    <p>2 January</p>

    <p>This is as far as I got on New Year's Eve, I had hoped your
    letter would come. If you haven't written already, do so now,
    for I haven't a cent left. But you are very busy, I
    suppose.</p>

    <p>Since then I have again done a few sketches with the
    lithographic crayon - it makes drawing almost as delightful as
    painting, and it gives a great vigour and depth of tone.</p>

    <p>I long very much indeed to see you again. I have so many
    plans - not all of which will be realized, I suppose, nor will
    they all be failures - and I want so badly to talk them over
    with you because I have so little time to think them over and I
    am so little in touch with what is in demand that I cannot
    judge what is practicable. Please do not let my having done
    nothing saleable this year worry you; you once said the same
    thing to me, and if I say so now, it is because I see a few
    things within my reach in the future which I couldn't see
    before.</p>

    <p><label content="business.co-op">I sometimes think of the time, a year ago, when I came here
    to The Hague. I had imagined that the painters formed a kind of
    circle or society in which warmth and cordiality and a certain
    kind of harmony reigned. This seemed to me quite natural, and I
    didn't suppose it <i>could</i> be different.</label></p>

    <p>Nor should I want to lose the ideas I had about it then,
    though I must modify them and distinguish between what is and
    what might be. I cannot believe so much coolness and disharmony
    is natural.</p>

    <p>What's the reason??? I don't know and it's not my business
    to find out, but it's a matter of principle with me that I
    personally must avoid two things. First, one must not quarrel
    but, instead of that, try to promote peace - for others as well
    as for oneself. And second, my opinion is that if one is a
    painter, one must not try to be something other than a painter
    in society; as a painter, one must avoid other social ambitions
    and not try to keep up with the people who live in the
    Voorhout, Willemspark, etc. For in the old dark, smoky studios
    there was a good fellowship and genuineness which was
    infinitely better than what threatens to replace it.</p>

    <p>If you should find some progress in my work when you come
    here again, I should have no other desire than to go on in the
    same way I have - that is, to continue my work quietly without
    mixing with anybody else. When there is bread in the house and
    I have some money in my pocket to pay the models, what more can
    I want? My pleasure lies in the progress of my work, and that
    absorbs me more and more.</p>

    <p>Well, boy, if you haven't written already, do so soon, for I
    am rather hard up. Once more, my best wishes for the New Year.
    I had a nice letter from home. Adieu. With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
