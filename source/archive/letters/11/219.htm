  <body>
    <p>Sunday morning</p>

    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received your letter with enclosed 50 fr. My warm thanks
    for both, and I am very glad you have given some details about
    your visit. <label content="feelings.nostalgia">Do you approve of our arranging to spend the time
    you have free from business and visits together, and both
    trying to be in the same frame of mind as we were in the days
    of the Rijswijk mill?</p>

    <p>As for me, brother - though the mill is gone and the years
    and my youth are gone as irrevocably - deep within me has risen
    again the feeling that there is some good in life, and that it
    is worth while to exert oneself and to try to take life
    seriously. Perhaps, or rather certainly, this is more firmly
    rooted than it used to be, when I had less experience. The
    question for me now is how to express the poetry of that time
    in my drawings.</label></p>

    <p>Your letter to me crossed one of mine in which I told you I
    had resolved to set to work again, sick or not sick. Well, I
    have done so, and I find it does me no harm, though I must take
    more medicine to brace me up. But of course the work itself
    puts me in a much better mood. I could not bear staying away
    from my drawings any longer.</p>

    <p>Now when you come, brother, I shall have a few watercolours
    for you. It is damn nice working in the studio. Do you remember
    that last winter I told you you would have your watercolours
    within a year?</p>

    <p>Those I have done now are simply to show you that my
    studying drawing, correct perspective and proportions, helps me
    make progress in watercolours. And for my part, I did them as
    an experiment to find out what progress I had made in
    watercolours after six months of drawing exclusively; and
    secondly, to see what I shall have to work harder on in that
    fundamental drawing which everything depends on.</p>

    <p>They are landscapes with complicated perspective, very
    difficult to draw, but for that very reason there is a real
    Dutch character and sentiment in them. They resemble those I
    sent last, the drawing is no less conscientious;<art id=943> but in
    addition these have colour</art> - the soft green of the meadow
    contrasting with the red tile roof, the light in the sky
    contrasting more strongly with the sombre tones of the
    foreground, a yard full of wet wood and sand.</p>

    <p>When judging me and my behaviour, Tersteeg always starts
    with the fixed idea that I can do nothing and am good for
    nothing. I heard it from his own lips, &ldquo;Oh, that painting
    of yours will be like all the other things you started, it will
    come to nothing.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>He spoke like this last winter; he speaks that way now, to
    which I replied that I did not wish to go to see him or have
    him come here for six months. You should thoroughly understand
    - for this reason I no longer care for him; and he should
    clearly understand once and for all that lately I have
    developed a strong aversion to him, and prefer to be done with
    him for good and all. I quietly continue working, and I shall
    gladly let him tell all the absurdities about me he may get
    into his noodle, as such sayings only annoy and upset me. As
    long as he does not hinder my work, I shall absolutely forget
    him.</p>

    <p>It was different last winter when he said something about
    his seeing to it that I should get no more money from you, and
    I wrote you about it at once. But I shall not write about him
    any more unless such a thing happens again. It would be too
    foolish to run after him, saying, Mr. Tersteeg, Mr. Tersteeg, I
    am a real painter like other painters, no matter what you
    say.</p>

    <p>No, since I do indeed have the artistic sense in the very
    marrow of my bones, I think it's much better to go quietly
    camping in the meadows or the dunes, or to work in the studio
    from the model, without paying the slightest attention to
    him.</p>

    <p>I am glad that you have been reading Le Ventre de Paris;
    lately I read Nana too. I tell you, Zola is really a second
    Balzac. Balzac the First describes society from 1815 to 1848.
    Zola begins where Balzac leaves off and goes on until Sedan, or
    rather until now. I think it's splendid. I just want to ask you
    what you think of Mme. Fran&ccedil;ois, who lifted poor Florent
    into her cart and took him home when he was lying unconscious
    in the middle of the road where the greengrocers' carts were
    passing.</p>

    <p>Though the other greengrocers cried, Let that drunkard lie,
    we have no time to pick men up out of the gutter, etc.</p>

    <p>That figure of Mme. Fran&ccedil;ois stands out so calmly and
    nobly and sympathetically all through the book, against the
    background of the Halles, in contrast with the brutal egoism of
    the other women.</p>

    <p>See, Theo, I think Mme. Fran&ccedil;ois is truly humane; and
    I have done, and will do, for Sien what I think someone like
    Mme. Fran&ccedil;ois would have done for Florent if he had not
    loved politics more than her. Look here, that humanity is the
    salt of life; I should not care to live without it, that's
    all.</p>

    <p>I care as little about what Tersteeg says as Mme.
    Fran&ccedil;ois cared about the other women and greengrocers
    when they cried, &ldquo;Let him be, we have no time,&rdquo; and
    about all the noise and gossip.</p>

    <p>Then I must tell you that it will not be long before Sien
    earns her own bread by posing. My very best drawing,
    <art id=929a>&ldquo;Sorrow&rdquo;</art> - at least, I think it's the best I've
    done - well, she posed for that, and in less than a year I
    shall draw the figure regularly. I promise you that. For
    understand clearly that however much I may like landscapes, I
    love drawing the figure more. But it is the most difficult, and
    therefore costs me more study and work, and also more time. But
    don't let them tell you she keeps me from my work; at the
    studio you will see for yourself how things are. If it were
    true that I worked less for her sake, yes, then you would be
    right; but, indeed, now it is exactly the reverse.</p>

    <p>Well, I hope we shall agree on that by and by, less by words
    than by drawings. I hate words. Enough.</p>

    <p>But, brother, I am so very glad you are coming; when you are
    here, shall we really go through the meadows together, with
    nothing around us but that quiet, tender, soft green and the
    light sky above? Fine - and the sea and the beach, and the
    <i>old</i> part of Scheveningen. Delightful.</p>

    <p>Apropos - the other day I saw some very beautiful little
    fusains by Th. de Bock, with touches of white and a delicate
    blue in the sky, very well done; I like them better than his
    pictures.</p>

    <p>I can't tell you how wonderful I find all the space in the
    studio - now that I have set to work, the effect is immediately
    apparent. We'll teach them to say of my drawings
    &ldquo;<i>they're only the old ones</i>.&rdquo; After all, I
    didn't get ill for the fun of it.</p>

    <p>So you must picture me sitting in my attic window as early
    as 4 o'clock in the morning, studying the meadows and the
    carpenter's yard with my perspective frame just as they're
    lighting the fires to make coffee in the yard and the first
    worker comes strolling in. A flock of white pigeons comes
    soaring over the red tile roofs between the smoking black
    chimney stacks. Beyond it all lies an infinity of delicate,
    soft green, miles and miles of flat meadow, and a grey sky, as
    calm, as peaceful as Corot or Van Goyen.</p>

    <p><art id=943>That view over the ridges of the roofs and the gutters with
    grass growing in them, very early in the morning, and those
    first signs of life and awakening - the flying bird, the
    smoking chimney, the small figure strolling along far below -
    that is the subject of my watercolour</art>. I hope
    you will like it.</p>

    <p>I'm sure that it depends more on my work than on anything
    else whether or not I succeed one day. Provided I can just keep
    going, well then, I shall fight my fight quietly in this way
    and no other - by calmly looking through my little window at
    natural things and drawing them faithfully and with love. For
    the rest, I shall just adopt a defensive attitude against
    possible molestation, and beyond that I love drawing too much
    to want to be distracted by anything else. The peculiar effects
    of perspective intrigue me more than human intrigues.</p>

    <p>If Tersteeg only understood that my painting is a thing
    apart, quite different from the rest, he would not make a
    fuss.</p>

    <p>But in his opinion I have deceived and disappointed Mauve.
    Furthermore, he thinks I'm only doing it to get more money from
    you. All this is absurd - too absurd to attach any importance
    to it. Mauve himself will understand later that he was not
    deceived in me, and that I was not at all unwilling. <i>He
    himself</i> was the one who taught me to draw more
    conscientiously before trying anything else. But then there was
    a misunderstanding between us, perhaps Tersteeg was behind it.
    Relationships with people like Tersteeg, who cling to their
    prejudices, are absolutely sterile and useless.</p>

    <p>In answer to your letter I must say one thing, that your not
    knowing about Sien's child was not my fault, for when I told
    you about her I certainly mentioned it, but you probably
    thought of the child that had not yet been born.</p>

    <p>I have already spoken a few words about the love for
    humanity which some people possess, for instance, Mme.
    Fran&ccedil;ois in the book by Zola. However, I haven't any
    benevolent plans or projects for trying to help everybody, but
    I am not ashamed to say (though I know quite well that the word
    <i>benevolence</i> is in bad repute) that for my part I have
    always felt and will feel the need to love some fellow
    creature. Preferably, I don't know why, an unhappy, forsaken or
    lonely creature.</p>

    <p>Once I nursed for six weeks or two months a poor miserable
    miner who had been burned. I shared my food for a whole winter
    with a poor old man, and heaven knows what else, and now there
    is Sien. But so far I have never thought all this foolish or
    wrong. I think it so natural and right that I cannot understand
    people being so indifferent to each other in general. I must
    add that if I were wrong in doing this, you were also wrong in
    helping me so faithfully - it would be too absurd if this were
    wrong. I have always believed that &ldquo;love thy neighbour as
    thyself&rdquo; is no exaggeration, but a normal condition. So
    be it. And you know that I shall make every effort to try to
    sell my drawings soon, for the very reason that I do not want
    to abuse your kindness.</p>

    <p>I certainly and confidently believe, brother, that to all
    the hints they may give you to convince you to stop sending me
    money, you will quietly answer that you have faith in my
    becoming a good painter, and so will continue to help me; that
    as to my private life and business, you left me free therein,
    and will neither force me nor help others to force me. Then I
    believe they will soon stop their gossip. The only thing they
    can do is exclude me from some circles where they consider me
    an outcast. Which is nothing new and doesn't bother me one way
    or the other. I will concentrate more and more on art. And
    though some people may damn me irrevocably and forever, in the
    nature of things my profession and my work will open new
    relationships to me, that much fresher for not having been
    frozen, hardened and made sterile by old prejudices.</p>

    <p>Well, brother, thanks for your letter and the 50 fr.; my
    drawing has dried in the meantime, and I want to touch it up.
    The lines of the roofs and gutters shoot away into the distance
    like arrows from a bow, they are drawn without hesitation.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>P. S. Read as much of Zola as you can; that is good for one,
    and makes things clear.</p>
