  <body>
    <p>My dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Just a word to acknowledge the safe receipt of your letter,
    for the contents of which my hearty thanks.</p>

    <p>I have done hardly anything but watercolours these last few
    days. Enclosed is a small sketch of a large one.
    You may remember<art id=970> Mooijman's State Lottery office at the
    top of Spuistraat.</art> I passed it one rainy morning when a crowd
    of people were standing outside waiting to get their lottery
    tickets. Most of them were little old women and the sort of
    people of whom one cannot tell what they do or how they live,
    but who evidently scrape and struggle to make their way through
    life.</p>

    <p>Of course, superficially a small crowd of people like that
    so patently interested in &ldquo;Today's Draw&rdquo; is
    something to make you and me smile, neither of us giving two
    pins for the lottery.</p>

    <p>But I was struck by that small group and their expectant
    expressions, and while I did the sketch it assumed a greater
    and deeper significance for me than it had at first sight. It
    seems to me that it takes on more significance when one views
    it as: <i>the poor and money</i>. However, that is true of
    nearly all groups of figures - one must think about them before
    one can tell what one is looking at. The keen interest in, and
    the illusions about, the lottery may seem rather childish to
    us, but are serious indeed when we think of their counterpart,
    the misery and the sort of efforts de perdus [forlorn efforts]
    of those poor wretches to find salvation, as they think,
    through a lottery ticket possibly paid for with their last
    pennies, money that should have gone on food.</p>

    <p>Be that as it may, I am trying my hand at a large
    watercolour of it. And am also doing <art id=967>one of a pew, which I saw
    in a small church in the Geest </art>attended by the almshouse people
    (in these parts they are called, very expressively
    <i>orphan</i> men and women).</p>

    <p><?showImage("266_V-T_2350");?>
     Once again hard at work drawing. I sometimes think there is
    nothing nicer than drawing.</p>

    <p>This is a part of that pews piece - there are other heads,
    of men, in the background. Things like this are
    difficult, however, and don't always work straight away. When
    they do work, it's sometimes the end result of a whole series
    of failures.</p>

    <p>Speaking of orphan men, I was interrupted while writing
    these lines by the arrival of my model. And I worked with him
    until dark. He was wearing a large old overcoat (which lends
    him a curiously broad figure) [F 962, JH 212].</p>

    <p>I think you may perhaps like this <art id=967>collection</art>
    of <art id=956a>orphan</art> men in <art id=959>their</art>
    Sunday <art id=958>best </art>and <art id=963>their </art>
    working <art id=965>clothes</art>.</p>

    <p>Then I got him sitting with a short pipe as well. He has a
    nice bald head, large (N.B. deaf) ears and white
    side-whiskers.</p>

    <p><?showImage("266_V-T_2351");?>
    </p>

    <p>I did this sketch at dusk, but perhaps you can just make out
    the composition. Once it's all together, it's quickly drawn,
    but it wasn't all that easy to put it together and I wouldn't
    say that I've put it together as well as I would have liked. I
    should like to paint it, with the figures about one foot high,
    or a little less, and the composition a little wider.</p>

    <p>But I don't know if I'll do it. It would need a large
    canvas, and if things go wrong it could mean quite a bit of
    money wasted. So, much as I should like to do it, I think that
    if I carry on with my typical figures, these things will come
    by themselves. They will spring naturally from the studies
    after the model, be it in this or in another form, but with the
    same sentiment.</p>

    <p>I am beginning to see more and more how useful and essential
    it is to keep hold of one's studies after the model. Though
    they have less value for others, the one who made them will
    recognize the model in them and will be reminded vividly of how
    things were.</p>

    <p>If you get a chance, please try to return some of my old
    studies. I hope that I shall be able to do better things with
    them in time.</p>

    <p>It goes without saying that in that group of figures, of
    which I am sending you a quick black sketch, there were many
    splendid things in colour - blue smocks and brown jackets,
    white, black and yellowish workmen's trousers, faded shawls, an
    overcoat that had turned greenish, white bonnets and black top
    hats, muddy paving stones and boots setting off pale or
    weather-beaten faces. And it all cries out for watercolour or
    oils. Well, I am hard at it.</p>

    <p>I count on your writing again - you will, won't you? And
    once more thanks for the timely remittance which is
    indispensable if I am to carry on working hard. Goodbye, my
    dear fellow, let me shake your hand warmly in thought, and
    believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>There is a bit more foreground in the watercolour - here,
    the figures are too prominent and the eye doesn't have enough
    command of the foreground.</p>
