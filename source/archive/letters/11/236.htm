  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Enclosed you will find a little sketch of a larger
    watercolour. I also started another one with many more figures,
    the last summer guests on the beach - <art id=980>an evening effect</art>.</p>

    <p>I do not know whether I shall be able to carry it out, but
    we must do what we can and struggle on until we reach our goal.
    The large one which I sent you a sketch of in my last letter is
    progressing.</p>

    <p>I am sure you would like the things I am doing now. What you
    would notice at once, as I do, is that <i>I need a lot of
    figure studies</i>; therefore I am working with all my strength
    and have a model almost every day.</p>

    <p>I have made even more studies of the old men, and this week
    I also hope to have a woman from the almshouse, but I am badly
    in need of some money; so many things are necessary. I also owe
    Stam something.</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.parents">Just imagine, this week to my great surprise I received a
    parcel from home, with a winter coat, a pair of warm trousers
    and a warm woman's coat. It touched me very much.</label></p>

    <p>I can't get that churchyard with the wooden crosses out of
    my mind. Perhaps I shall make some studies of it beforehand. I
    should like to make it in the snow - a peasant's burial or the
    like - in short, an <i>effect</i> like <art id=1202>the enclosed sketch of
    miners</art>. To complete the seasons, I am sending
    you a <art id=1245>little sketch of the spring</art> and another
    of the fall; they came into my mind while I was making the
    first one.</p>

    <p>How beautiful it is outside now! I try my best to catch the
    autumn effects. I am writing you in a great hurry. I can assure
    you those compositions with figures are no joke, and I am deep
    in my work. It is like weaving - one needs all one's attention
    to keep the threads apart - one must manage to keep an eye on
    several things at once.</p>

    <p>The little drawing of the beach is more finished than the
    others because it has served me when doing the large one,
    whereas the others are less watercolour.</p>

    <p>Well, I certainly hope that your own pocket is not too
    empty. Nature is so beautiful these days that I really must put
    some of it on paper.</p>

    <p>Adieu, write as soon as possible, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
