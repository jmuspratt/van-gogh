  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Friday I was informed by the hospital at Leyden that Sien
    might come home Saturday; so I went there today, and we came
    home together, and now she is here at Schenkweg and so far all
    is well, both she and the baby. She has enough milk, and the
    baby is quiet.</p>

    <p>How I wish you could have seen her today. I assure you her
    appearance has quite changed since last winter, it has been a
    complete transformation. If some of this is to my credit, and
    that through your help, of course much more is due to the
    professor who treated her. But what the professor has less to
    do with is the effect on her of the strong attachment between
    us two. A woman changes when she loves and is loved; when
    nobody cares for her, she loses her spirits and the charm is
    gone. Love draws out what is in her, and her development
    definitely depends on it. Nature must have its free course,
    must go its normal way; what a woman wants is to be with one
    man, and with him forever. This is not always possible, but any
    other way is against nature. So she now has quite another
    expression than last winter, and her eyes look different; her
    glance is calm and quiet, and there is an expression of
    happiness on her face, of peace and quiet, the more touching
    because she is of course still suffering. I wrote you once that
    the form of her head, the line of her profile, is exactly like
    that figure by Landelles, &ldquo;L'Ange de la Passion,&rdquo;
    so it is far from ordinary; it is decidedly noble, but it does
    not always strike the eye at once. Today, however, it was
    exactly, exactly so.</p>

    <p>Before she left the hospital, the professor - who felt real
    sympathy for her, as he had known her before, and treated her
    with special care this time and examined her thoroughly at her
    request (because I had made her promise to ask this before she
    went) - took the trouble to speak with her at length and in
    detail about what she should and should not do to keep
    well.</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li value="1">
        <p>Being with <i>one</i> man - seeing that everything in
        her constitution and temperament makes her fit for domestic
        life, and decidedly unfit for the sort of life misery had
        forced her to lead in the past.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="2">
        <p>That she should be out of doors as much as possible, and
        as soon as she has regained her strength, she should take
        many walks - inhale lots of fresh air.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="3">
        <p>As to food, he told her what she should have and what
        would be harmful.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="4">
        <p>She should often wash with cold water and alcohol, and
        take a hot bath once every week.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="5">
        <p>She ought to avoid emotions that make her nervous - for
        instance, anxiety, tension, disquiet.</p>
      </li>

      <li value="6">
        <p>She must not scrub floors or do other kinds of really
        hard work which would force her to keep her head down, like
        cleaning the passage, for instance, and particularly,
        should not lift heavy things.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>In other words, substantially what he told her before - only
    now he explained it all to her in more detail. Everything
    indicates that he is really interested in her. Also, of course,
    he spoke to her about me at some length; he knows all about my
    indisposition, and told her I did quite right in going to the
    hospital, and he explained to her exactly how he thinks I got
    it. He returned to the question of whether her relation with me
    was permanent and whether I should ever desert her, not once
    but <i>very often</i>, and when she went on assuring him it was
    all right, he thought she was pulling his leg. But he ended by
    saying, If you have really got your man permanently, you have a
    big advantage. What he especially insisted on was that she
    should lead a regular and quiet life.</p>

    <p><label content="health.venereal">Passing water had improved a good deal, until some
    particularly cold and wet days influenced me more or less
    unfavorably. For a number of days the jet was vigorous again
    when passing water, and practically back to normal. Although
    right now this is no longer the case, yet I think it is a sign
    of improvement, and should the weather stay dry and fine, as it
    is today, things will improve even more quickly.</label></p>

    <p>When she left, not only the nurse on her ward, but the head
    nurse herself came to say goodbye to her. I was present and
    thanked her, as I had three letters from her when Sien was not
    allowed to write. She stood talking with us for some time.
    Fortunately, it was quite warm fine weather and the journey
    came off all right. Sien's mother and her little girl had come
    to the Schenkweg and were waiting for us there. It was indeed a
    delightful homecoming, and Sien was in high spirits about
    everything, especially about the cradle, about the easy chair,
    about everything. But she was especially glad to see her little
    girl again; I had given her a pair of new boots for the
    occasion, and she looked very pretty.</p>

    <p>Last May there was an accumulation of difficulties, her
    confinement, my illness, complicated by the question of how
    things would go and where she would live when she left the
    hospital. Light and relief have come in many ways. At times she
    still suffers much pain because of the operation with the
    forceps, and there are still other, more natural results of her
    confinement; there is great weakness, but one can see that
    there is a renewing and reviving in her - a recovery of her
    body and a recovery of her soul at the same time. Now there is
    an atmosphere of &ldquo;home,&rdquo; of one's own
    &ldquo;hearth&rdquo; here. I can understand Michelet's saying,
    &ldquo;La femme c'est une religion.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>She will probably feel pain and will have to be very careful
    for at least six weeks after her confinement.</p>

    <p>I believe that you will see, for instance, from the
    professor's and the head nurse's special attention to her that
    she is somebody for whom serious persons have sympathy; indeed,
    it is quite remarkable that they have given her that kind of
    care.</p>

    <p>When I came into the maternity ward, where I saw several
    patients, it struck me that she was quite different from the
    others, though she is simple enough. But there is more spirit
    and sensitivity in her; one can see that suffering and hard
    times have refined her. I hope you will not have any scruples
    about making her acquaintance.</p>

    <p>I was greatly amused by what Sien told about her
    conversations with the professor; it was really funny. He seems
    to be very jovial with his patients; for instance, he said,
    &ldquo;By the way, do you like to drink a gin and bitters, and
    can you smoke a cigar?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;I only asked,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to tell you that
    you need not give them up.&rdquo; But on the other hand, he
    vehemently forbade her to use vinegar, mustard and pepper. On
    days when, as often happens, she is more thirsty than hungry,
    she must take a gin and bitters as a medicine, to give her an
    appetite.</p>

    <p>He has given her a list of nourishing foods, after
    consulting her as to what she could afford. I myself shall also
    follow his advice in these things. Meat is good for her, but
    once or twice a week is sufficient; it is not necessary every
    day.</p>

    <p>Her first remedy, the most important medicine, was to have a
    home of her own, that is what he kept on insisting on. I was
    afraid perhaps that Sien would have to take expensive things,
    but the diet he prescribed is really the most economical one
    can imagine. So I really think we can manage on 150 fr. a
    month. Besides, he told Sien that if the child should ever
    become ill during the next two years, she can always consult
    the professor at Leyden, and also get free medicine. &ldquo;I
    not only want to help you through your confinement, my
    lass,&rdquo; the professor said, &ldquo;but I want you to
    become a strong, healthy woman again in a few years. You have a
    whole life ahead of you if you do as I tell you.&rdquo; Well,
    he has talked with her and advised her about large things and
    small, as if he were her own father, so she came home much more
    bright and cheerful.</p>

    <p><label content="health.gastrointestinal">I am getting on well, though I still feel very weak, but I
    shall get over it in time. It is not surprising when you
    realize that for two months now I have had indigestion, poor
    appetite, fever, etc., which still troubles me a little.</label></p>

    <p>I have also started drawing again, and though it gives me a
    headache and soon tires me, it will pass by and by, especially
    as I shall be able to begin at home with the woman and the
    child posing for me. It disappoints me to feel so weak still,
    but it is always that way after an illness such as mine.</p>

    <p>The two drawings I did recently are both watercolours
    because I wanted to try it. However, it seems to me that even
    now I must work harder on actual drawing, which is the
    foundation of all the rest. But as you saw from the last one, I
    am beginning to wash in by degrees.</p>

    <p>As soon as I am quite well again,<label content="art.support"> I should like to do a
    clear watercolour on <i>Harding</i>, because this paper permits
    (more than the Whatman) putting in a solid black-and-white
    foundation before beginning to wash in, without spoiling the
    watercolour effect.</label> But now I cannot work for a long enough
    stretch, which worries me a great deal; I am so anxious to set
    to work, especially in the open air. In the meantime, as things
    are, I am glad to be able to do at least a little.</p>

    <p>I began this letter last night, and now I can tell you that
    we - that is, the woman, the two children and I - spent a night
    in the large attic. The bedroom looks a good deal like the hold
    of a ship because it is completely boarded, and I think it is
    very healthy. The cradle has to be carried downstairs during
    the day. Everything was all right, and if no difficulties arise
    from the outside, and I hope they will not, we at home will get
    along very well. As for me, I do not feel strange in the
    company of the woman and the children, but more in my element,
    and as if we had been together a long time. Using my hands to
    do things which Sien is too weak to do, for instance, making
    the beds or a thousand other things, is not unusual for me. I
    have often done things like that, either for myself or for sick
    people, etc.</p>

    <p>And the old Dutch pictures and drawings prove clearly enough
    that those things do not stand in the way of painting and
    drawing. The mixture of studio and family life is no drawback,
    especially for a painter of the figure. I remember perfectly
    interiors of studios by Ostade - small pen drawings, probably
    of corners of his own house - which show clearly enough that
    Ostade's studio looked very little like those studios where one
    finds Oriental weapons and vases and Persian rugs, etc.</p>

    <p>Now, speaking more particularly about art, I sometimes have
    a great urge to start <i>painting</i> again. The studio is
    larger now, the light better; I have a good cupboard to keep my
    paints in, so they will not make too much dirt and mess. I have
    already started with watercolour. I depends on my getting well
    again; as soon as there is no danger of a relapse and I can go
    out and sit in the open air, I intend to start it all again,
    and put some energy into it.</p>

    <p>I think, now that Sien and I live together and need not
    maintain two separate establishments, I shall be able to spend
    more of the 150 fr. a month on painting materials than I have
    up to now. Neither Sien nor I is afraid of having to manage
    with little, and we should not care to have more furniture or
    household things as long as I do not earn anything by selling
    drawings. For we would much rather wait to buy such things than
    to borrow more money now, even if we could get it.</p>

    <p>As soon as she has quite recovered, Sien will begin posing
    seriously again, and I assure you her figure is good enough.
    That she poses well and is fit for it you can see for yourself
    from<art id=929a> &ldquo;Sorrow,&rdquo;</art> for instance, and a few other
    drawings you have.</p>

    <p>I have some more studies from the nude which you have not
    seen yet; I should like to go on with it as soon as she is
    able, for one learns much from it. Even if I could not continue
    working in the open air for some time for fear of a relapse
    (which I hope will not be the case), I shall at all events find
    subjects enough at home and shall not have to sit idle.</p>

    <p>I had a fine letter from Father and Mother. Just think, they
    enclosed two coupons. They must not do that again, however,
    because I know they need it themselves; and I repeat, we can
    manage with the money from you, now that things have taken such
    a good turn as to Sien's condition and my recovery. So I would
    rather not receive money from Father and Mother. As I wrote
    you, I should like to send Father the money for the journey
    here as soon as I can spare it and when Sien is well again; and
    then when he is here, we can talk about everything.</p>

    <p>What pleases me more than the coupons is that their attitude
    is the best I can possibly expect under the circumstances, so
    that I hope that when I speak to them about Sien they will not
    oppose it on principle, but will accept it with good will.</p>

    <p>The other day I saw the exhibition of French art from the
    Mesdag, Post, etc., collections. There are many beautiful
    things by Dupr&eacute;, Corot, Daubigny, Diaz, Courbet, Breton,
    Jacque, etc. What I particularly admired was the large sketch
    by Th. Rousseau from the Mesdag collection - a herd of cows in
    the Alps - and a landscape by Courbet - yellow, sandy hillocks
    covered here and there with fresh young grass and bordered by
    dark woods, which a few white birch trees stand out against;
    far in the distance little grey houses with red and blue slated
    roofs, and a narrow, light, delicate grey streak of sky above.
    But the horizon very high, so that the soil is the principal
    thing. And that fine streak of sky serves more as a contrast to
    make you feel the roughness of the masses of dark earth. I
    think this is the most beautiful thing of Courbet's I have ever
    seen.</p>

    <p>The Dupr&eacute;s are superb, and there is a Daubigny which
    I could not get enough of - large thatched roofs against the
    slope of a hill. Also a small Corot, a pond and lisi&egrave;re
    de bois [edge of a wood], at four o'clock or thereabouts on a
    summer morning. One single little pink cloud shows that the sun
    will soon rise - a silence and a calm and a peace which are
    fascinating.</p>

    <p>I am glad I have seen all this.</p>

    <p>Now I am going to finish this letter; I hope you will write
    soon, and I especially hope that you will really come to
    Holland by August. I write you &ldquo;between times,&rdquo; for
    as you can imagine, there is a lot to do. I let Sien putter
    around the house, but I must always be on the lookout to see
    what she is doing in order to be always on hand if by chance
    she wants help. For she is really weak still (she told me the
    professor had said &ldquo;damned weak&rdquo;), but it is good
    for her to find some distraction in keeping busy. Everything
    that cheers her and makes her happy is medicine for her.
    Neither is the baby absolutely out of danger - you know how the
    confinement went, that always influences the child somewhat -
    and little can be said about how things will go until six weeks
    have passed. Much depends on the mother's milk, of course. I
    hope it does not bore you to read all this. I wanted to write
    just a short note, and it has become a long letter. I am not
    yet out of cash, but if you could send something about the
    20<sup>th</sup>, it would be welcome for getting through the
    last days of the month.</p>

    <p>Adieu, with a hearty handshake in thought,</p>

    <p>Yours sincerely, Vincent</p>
