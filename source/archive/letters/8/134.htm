    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>If I am not mistaken, you must still have &ldquo;Les Travaux
    des Champs&rdquo; by Millet. Would you be so kind as to lend
    them to me for a short time, and send them by mail?</p>

    <p>I must tell you that I am busy sketching large drawings
    after Millet, and that I have already finished &ldquo;The Four
    Hours of the Day &ldquo;as well as &ldquo;The Sower.&rdquo;
    Well, perhaps if you saw them, you would not be altogether
    dissatisfied. Now if you send me &ldquo;Les Travaux des
    Champs,&rdquo; you might perhaps add some other prints by, or
    after, Millet, Breton, Feyen-Perrin, etc. Do not buy them for
    this purpose, but lend me what you have.</p>

    <p>Send me what you can, and do not fear for me. If I can only
    continue to work, somehow or other it will se me right again.
    Your doing this will help me a great deal. If you should take a
    trip to Holland, I hope you will not pass by here without
    coming to see the sketches.</p>

    <p>I write to you while I am busy drawing, and I am in a hurry
    to go back to it, so good night, and send me the prints as soon
    as possible, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Ever yours, Vincent</p>

    <p>C/o Charles Decrucq,</p>

    <p>Rue du Pavillon 3, Cuesmes.</p>

    <p>The Millets which I copied are, &ldquo;The Four Hours of the
    Day,&rdquo; the size is almost that of a page from the Cours de
    Dessin Bargue. You will understand well enough what I want
    without my telling you, but I'll tell you anyway, so you'll
    know what I really think. It is especially studies of the
    figure like &ldquo;The Diggers&rdquo; by Millet, or the
    lithograph after his &ldquo;Le Vanneur&rdquo; [The Winnower]
    and figures by Brion, Fr&egrave;re, or Feyen-Perrin, or Jules
    Breton. I think that you might perhaps find just what I want at
    the Alliance des Arts, where they sell lithographs of
    contemporary artists cheaply. One print which I should like to
    have immensely is the large etching by Daubigny after Ruysdael,
    &ldquo;Le Buisson&rdquo; [The Copse], which is sold at the
    chalcographic cabinet of the Louvre.</p>

    <p>I have sketched a drawing representing miners, men and
    women, going to the shaft in the morning through the snow, by a
    path along a thorn hedge: passing shadows, dimly visible in the
    twilight. In the background the large mine buildings and the
    heaps of clinkers stand out vaguely against the sky. I am
    sending you a hasty sketch so you can see what it is like. But
    I feel the need to study the drawing of the figure from masters
    like Millet, Breton, Brion, or Boughton, or others. What do you
    think of the sketch - do you think the idea good?</p>

    <p>Among Bingham's photographs of pictures by J. Breton, if I
    remember correctly, there is one representing gleaners: dark
    silhouettes against a red sky at sunset. Well, these are the
    things I want to study. It is because I think you would rather
    see me doing some good work than nothing that I write to you on
    this subject, and perhaps it might be a reason for restoring
    the <i>entente cordiale</i> and the sympathy between us, and
    make us of some use to one another.</p>

    <p>I should like very much to do that drawing over again,
    better than it is now. In the one I have done already, such as
    it is, the figures could be 10 cm. high. The pendant represents
    the return of the miners, but it did not turn out so well; it
    is very difficult, being an effect of brown silhouettes, just
    touched by light, against a mottled sky at sunset.</p>

    <p>Send me &ldquo;Les Travaux des Champs&rdquo; by return mail
    if you can and will. I wrote a note to Mr. Tersteeg to ask him
    if perhaps there was a chance of my having for a time the
    Exercices au Fusain, by Bargue - that is, the studies from the
    nude, which you know. I do not know whether he will send them
    or not, but in case he should not be willing to, could you put
    in a word for me? For those Exercices au Fusain would be of
    immense service to me. But perhaps he will do me the favour of
    sending at least a few sheets, if not the whole course.</p>
