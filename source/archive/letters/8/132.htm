  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am writing to you especially to tell you how grateful I am
    for your visit. It had been quite a long time since we had seen
    each other or had written as we used to do. Still, it is better
    to be close than dead to each other, the more so as, until one
    is truly entitled to be called dead by virtue of one's legal
    demise, it smacks of hypocrisy or at least childishness to
    carry on as if it were true. Childish in the manner of a young
    man of 14 who believes his dignity and rank in society oblige
    him to wear a top hat.</p>

    <p>The hours we spent together have at least assured us that we
    are both still in the land of the living. <label content="feelings.nostalgia">When I saw you again
    and walked with you, I had a feeling I used to have more often
    than I do now, namely that life is something good and precious
    which one should value, and I felt more cheerful and alive than
    I have been feeling for a long time, because in spite of myself
    my life has gradually become less precious, much less important
    and more a matter of indifference to me, or so it seemed.</label></p>

    <p>When one lives with others and is bound by feelings of
    affection, then one realizes that one has a reason for living,
    that one may not be utterly worthless and expendable, but is
    perhaps good for something, since we need one another and are
    journeying together as compagnons de voyage. But our proper
    sense of self-esteem is also highly dependent upon our
    relationship with others.</p>

    <p>A prisoner who is condemned to solitude, who is prevented
    from working, etc., will in the long run, especially if the run
    is too long, suffer from the effects as surely as one who has
    gone hungry too long. Like everyone else, I need friendly or
    affectionate relationships or intimate companionship, and am
    not made of stone or iron like a pump or a lamppost, and like
    any man of culture or decency I cannot do without these things
    and not feel a void, a lack of something - and I tell you all
    this to let you know how much good your visit has done me.</p>

    <p>And just as I would not want us to become estranged, so I
    would want to keep in with all at home. For the moment,
    however, I am not very keen on going back there and would much
    rather stay on here. Yet it may well all have been my own fault
    and you could be right about my not seeing things straight. And
    so, despite my great reluctance and though it is a hard course
    for me to take, I may yet go to Etten, at least for a few
    days.</p>

    <p>As I think back with gratitude to your visit, my thoughts
    return to our discussions as well, of course. I have had
    similar ones before, even a good many and often. Plans for
    improvement and change and generating energy - and yet, do not
    be offended, I am a little frightened by them, not least
    because I have sometimes acted upon them only to have my hopes
    dashed.</p>

    <p>How fresh my memory of that time in Amsterdam is. You were
    there yourself, so you know how things were planned and
    discussed, argued and considered, talked over with wisdom, with
    the best intentions, and yet how miserable the result was, how
    ridiculous the whole undertaking, how utterly foolish. I still
    shudder when I think of it.</p>

    <p>It was the worst time I have ever lived through. How
    desirable and attractive have become the difficult days, full
    of care, here in this poor country, in these uncivilized
    surroundings, compared to that. I fear a similar result if I
    follow wise advice given with the best intentions.</p>

    <p>Such experiences are too dreadful - the harm, the sorrow,
    the affliction is too great - not to try on both sides to
    become wiser by this dearly bought experience. If we do not
    learn from this, what shall we learn from? To try &ldquo;to
    reach the goal which was set before me,&rdquo; as the
    expression was then; indeed, I no longer aspire to it, the
    ambition has greatly abated. Even if it looked and sounded well
    before, now I look at those things from another point of view
    gained by experience, although this opinion is not
    permissible.</p>

    <p>Not permissible, aye, just as Frank the Evangelist thought
    it reprehensible of me to assert that the sermons of the
    Reverend Mr. John Andry are only a little more evangelical than
    those of a Roman Catholic priest. I would rather die a natural
    death than be prepared for it by the Academy, and I have
    sometimes had a lesson from a German mower that was of more use
    to me than one in Greek.</p>

    <p>A change for the better in my life, shouldn't I long for
    that, or are there times when one has no need of betterment? I
    hope I do become much improved. But precisely because that is
    what I long for, I am afraid of rem&egrave;des pires que le mal
    [cures worse than the disease]. Can you blame a patient for
    standing up to his doctor and preferring not to be given the
    wrong treatment or quack remedies?</p>

    <p>Is it wrong for someone suffering from consumption or typhus
    to insist that a more potent remedy than barley water might be
    indicated, might indeed be essential, or, while finding nothing
    wrong with barley water as such, to question its effectiveness
    and potency in his particular case? The doctor who prescribed
    the barley water would be wrong to say: this patient is an
    obstinate mule who is courting his own destruction because he
    refuses to take his medicine - no, it is not that the man is
    unwilling, but that the so-called remedy is worthless, because
    though it might well be good for something, it does not fit the
    case.</p>

    <p>Can you blame a person for remaining indifferent to a
    painting listed in the catalogue as a Memling, but having
    nothing more in common with a Memling than that it has a
    similar subject from the Gothic period, but without artistic
    merit?</p>

    <p>And if you should conclude from these remarks that I meant
    to suggest your advice was worthy of a quack, then you have
    completely misunderstood me, as I have no such thoughts or
    opinions about you. If, on the other hand, you believe that I
    would do well to follow your advice literally to become an
    engraver of invoice headings and visiting cards, or a
    bookkeeper or a carpenter's apprentice - or follow the advice
    of my very dear sister Anna to devote myself to the baker's
    trade or many other similar things (curiously at odds and
    hardly compatible) that other people advise me.</p>

    <p>But you say, &ldquo;I do not expect you to take that advice
    literally; I was just afraid you were too fond of spending your
    days in idleness, and I thought you should put an end to
    it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>May I observe that this is a rather strange sort of
    &ldquo;idleness.&rdquo; It is somewhat difficult for me to
    defend myself, but I should be very sorry if, sooner or later,
    you could not see it differently. I am not sure it would be
    right to combat such an accusation by becoming a baker, for
    instance. It would indeed be a decisive answer (always
    supposing that it were possible to assume, quick as lightning,
    the form of a baker, a barber or a librarian); but at the same
    time it would be a foolish answer, more or less like the action
    of a man who, when reproached with cruelty for riding a donkey,
    immediately dismounted and continued his way with the donkey on
    his shoulders.</p>

    <p>And now, all joking aside, it is my honest opinion that it
    would be better if the relationship between us were to become
    closer on both sides.<label content="feelings.despair"> If ever I came to believe seriously that
    I was being a nuisance or a burden to you or those at home, of
    no use to anyone, and were obliged to look upon myself as an
    intruder or to feel superfluous so far as you are concerned, so
    that it would be better if I were not there at all, and if I
    should have to try all the time to keep out of other people's
    way - were I really to think that, then I should be overwhelmed
    by a feeling of sadness and should have to wrestle with
    despair.</label></p>

    <p>I find it hard to bear this thought and even harder to bear
    the thought that so much dissention, misery and sorrow between
    us, and in our home, may have been caused by me. Should that
    indeed be the case, then I might wish it were granted me not to
    have much longer to live.</p>

    <p>Yet when this thought sometimes depresses me beyond measure,
    far too deeply, then after a long time another occurs too:
    'Perhaps it is only an awful, frightening dream and later we
    may learn to see and understand it more clearly.' Or is it
    real, and will it ever get better rather than worse? Many
    people would undoubtedly consider it foolish and superstitious
    to go on believing in a change for the better.</p>

    <p>It is sometimes so bitterly cold in the winter that one
    says, `The cold is too awful for me to care whether summer is
    coming or not; the harm outdoes the good.' But with or without
    our approval, the severe weather does come to an end eventually
    and one fine morning the wind changes and there is the thaw.
    When I compare the state of the weather to our state of mind
    and our circumstances, subject to change and fluctuation like
    the weather, then I still have some hope that things may get
    better.</p>

    <p>If you were to write again soon, you would make me very
    happy. Should you do so, please address your letter care of J.
    B. Denis, Rue du Petit Wasmes &agrave; Wasmes (Hainaut).</p>

    <p>Walked to Wasmes the evening after you left. Have drawn yet
    another portrait since. Goodbye, accept a handshake in my
    thoughts and believe me,</p>

    <p>Yours truly, Vincent</p>
