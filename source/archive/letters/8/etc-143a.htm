    <p>[Reprinted from Louis Pi&eacute;rard, La vie tragique
    de Vincent van Gogh, Edition revue, Paris, Editions Correa
    &amp; Cie, 1939.]</p>

    <p>Reading an article by M. Pierre Godet in <i>L'Art
    D&eacute;coratif</i> and the comments it prompted from a
    certain Protestant publication, <i>Fol et Vie</i>, induced me
    one day to start investigating in my native country this
    disturbing period of Vincent van Gogh's life. I knew that
    Vincent had once been sent as a missionary to the Borinage;
    nothing more. I have patiently interrogated the pastors of
    numerous villages and a certain number of their congregations.
    And at last I had the information I sought.</p>

    <p>It was during a strike. Before the Village Hall an old
    miner, squatting with his knees drawn up to his chin, a pipe
    between his teeth - in the favorite resting position of
    <i>&ldquo;tapeurs &agrave; la veine"</i> - said in his
    rude patois, <i>"L'pasteur Vincent? Si j'mein
    souvi&eacute;s? Je l'crois b&eacute;!"</i> [Pastor
    Vincent? Do I remember him? I should think so!]...I did my best
    to make him specify his memories more precisely. In his mind's
    eye he saw Van Gogh again, sitting on a campstool in the yard
    at the mine (at pit No. 10, Grisoeul), making sketches of the
    cage and <i>&ldquo;la belle fleur,&rdquo;</i> the iron
    framework, and then of the emerging miners, black with coal
    dust, their eyes blinking at the sudden daylight, their lamps
    in their fists...</p>

    <p>At last I learned that Van Gogh had boarded at the house of
    a certain Jean-Baptiste Denis, a baker, and had preached in the
    old &ldquo;Salon de B&eacute;b&eacute;&rdquo; (in
    the Borinage, a hall for dancing and meetings is always called
    a <i>salon).</i> The old house, which at the time was something
    between a farm and a <i>salon,</i> has been much altered during
    the last thirty years. But when I found the vast kitchen
    intact, with its mighty beams covered with white stucco, the
    big open hearth, and in a corner the stone table at which
    Vincent liked to eat, I was moved...The <i>Salon,</i> or as
    some said, <i>L'timpe</i> [the temple] of
    B&eacute;b&eacute;, was situated at the edge of the
    Colfontaine forest. The whitewashed walls of the meeting hall
    were bluish-white. Behind the preacher one could see the
    sloping gardens, the square vegetable plots, through the
    window...</p>

    <p>So here Van Gogh lived after November 1878 in the Borinage,
    vast mining district in the neighborhood of Mons...The Reformed
    religion has always possessed, and does to this day, important
    nuclei here. In every mining village, or in nearly every one,
    there is a Protestant church, and in some, two (one of the
    National Church, and the other of the Free Church, which
    refuses State subsidies)...</p>

    <p>At last, after a long search, I found in the Tournaisis
    district an old pastor, M. Bonte, who was installed in
    Warquignies, a village in the neighborhood of Wasmes, in 1878,
    and received Vincent van Gogh with the greatest kindness. Here
    are the notes he was good enough to send me:</p>

    <p>I should like to satisfy you as much as possible by putting
    together some reminiscences of Vincent van Gogh. In fact, I
    knew him some forty-five years ago in the Borinage where he was
    an evangelist (not a pastor, as he had no theological degree).
    He worked at Wasmes about one year.</p>

    <p>He was the son of a Dutch minister. I remember well his
    arrival at P&acirc;turages;<label content="lifestyle.appearance"> he was a blond young man of
    medium stature and with a pleasant face; he was well dressed,
    had excellent manners, and showed in his personal appearance
    all the characteristics of Dutch cleanliness.</label></p>

    <p>He expressed himself in French correctly, and was able to
    preach quite satisfactorily at the religious gatherings of the
    little Protestant group in Wasmes which they had entrusted to
    his care. Another community in Wasmes had a pastor. He worked
    near the edge of the forest, in the direction of Warquignies;
    he led divine service in a former dance hall.</p>

    <p>Our young man took lodgings in an old farm at Petit-Wasmes.
    The house was relatively pretty - it differed considerably from
    the dwellings in the neighborhood, where one saw only little
    miners' cottages.</p>

    <p>The family which had taken Vincent in had simple habits, and
    lived like working people.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.masochism">But our evangelist very soon showed toward his lodgings the
    peculiar feelings which dominated him: he considered the
    accommodation far too luxurious; it shocked his Christian
    humility, he could not bear being lodged comfortably, in a way
    so different from that of the miners. Therefore he left these
    people who had surrounded him with sympathy and went to live in
    a little hovel. There he was all alone; he had no furniture,
    and people said he slept crouched down in a corner of the
    hearth.</label></p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.clothing">Besides this, the clothes he wore outdoors revealed the
    originality of his aspirations; people saw him issue forth clad
    in an old soldier's tunic and a shabby cap, and he went about
    the village in this attire. The fine suits he had arrived in
    never reappeared; nor did he buy any new ones. It is true he
    had only a modest salary, but it was sufficient to permit him
    to dress in accordance with his social position. Why had the
    boy changed this way?</label></p>

    <p>Faced with the destitution he encountered on his visits, his
    pity had induced him to give away nearly all his clothes; his
    money had found its way into the hands of the poor, and one
    might say that he had kept nothing for himself. His religious
    sentiments were very ardent, and he wanted to obey the words of
    Jesus Christ to the letter.</p>

    <p>He felt obliged to imitate the early Christians, to
    sacrifice all he could live without, and he wanted to be even
    more destitute than the majority of the miners to whom he
    preached the Gospel.</p>

    <p>I must add that also his Dutch cleanliness was singularly
    abandoned; soap was banished as a wicked luxury; and when our
    evangelist was not wholly covered with a layer of coal dust,
    his face was usually dirtier than that of the miners. Exterior
    details did not trouble him; he was absorbed in his ideal of
    self-denial, but for the rest he showed that his attitude was
    not the consequence of <i>laisser-aller,</i> but a consistent
    practicing of the ideas governing his conscience.</p>

    <p>He no longer felt any inducement to take care of his own
    well-being - his heart had been aroused by the sight of others'
    want.</p>

    <p>He preferred to go to the unfortunate, the wounded, the
    sick, and always stayed with them a long time; he was willing
    to make any sacrifice to relieve their sufferings.</p>

    <p>In addition, his profound sensitivity was not limited to the
    human race. Vincent van Gogh respected every creature's life,
    even of those most despised.</p>

    <p>A repulsive caterpillar did not provoke his disgust; it was
    a living creature, and as such, deserved protection.</p>

    <p>The family with whom he had boarded told me that every time
    he found a caterpillar on the ground in the garden, he
    carefully picked it up and took it to a tree. Apart from this
    trait, which perhaps will be considered insignificant or even
    foolish, I have retained the impression that Vincent van Gogh
    was actuated by a high ideal: self-forgetfulness and devotion
    to all other beings was the guiding principle which he accepted
    wholeheartedly.</p>

    <p>It will not revile the memory of the man to confess that in
    my opinion he retained one weakness: he was an incorrigible
    smoker. At times I teased him about it; a loather of tobacco
    myself, I told him that he did wrong not to give it up, but he
    ignored me - Painters cannot do without a little spot of shade
    in the picture.</p>

    <p>As far as his painting is concerned, I cannot speak as a
    connoisseur; besides, he was not taken seriously.</p>

    <p>He would squat in the mine fields and draw the women picking
    up pieces of coal and going away laden with heavy sacks.</p>

    <p>It was observed that he did not reproduce the pretty things
    to which we are wont to attribute beauty.</p>

    <p>He made some portraits of old women, but for the rest,
    nobody attached any importance to an activity that was
    considered a mere hobby.</p>

    <p>But it would seem that as an artist, also, our young man had
    a predilection for all that seemed miserable to him.</p>

    <p>These, sir, are a few reminiscences which my aged memory has
    tried to collect...</p>

    <p>Here is another letter. I did not have the heart to make any
    alteration in it. The good baker who wrote it and who had lived
    on intimate terms with Vincent van Gogh will not take it amiss
    if I reproduce it completely and faithfully.</p>

    <p>Monsieur Pi&eacute;rard, <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>One fine spring day, when I saw our young friend Vincent van
    Gogh arrive, richly dressed, I could not stop looking at him,
    next day he paid a visit to the pastor, M. Bonte. <label content="lifestyle.clothing">Immediately
    putting himself on a level with the working class, our friend
    sank away into the greatest humiliations, and it was not long
    before he had disposed of all his clothes.</p>

    <p>Having arrived at the stage where he had no shirt and no
    socks on his feet, we have seen him make shirts out of sacking.</label>
    I myself was too young then.</p>

    <p>My kind-hearted mother said to him: Monsieur Vincent, why do
    you deprive yourself of all your clothes like this - you who
    are descended from such a noble family of Dutch pastors? He
    answered: I am a friend of the poor like Jesus was. She
    answered: You're no longer in a normal condition.</p>

    <p>The same year there was a firedamp explosion in Pit No. 1 of
    the Charbonnage Belge, and many miners were burned. Our friend
    Vincent did not give himself a moment's rest day and night
    cutting up the last remnants of his linen to make bandages with
    wax and olive oil on them, and then ran to the wounded to dress
    their burns.</p>

    <p>The humanity of our friend continued to grow day by day, and
    yet the persecutions he suffered grew, too. And still the
    reproaches and insults and stoning by the members of the
    Consistory, though he always remained in the deepest abasement!
    One day when he came to our house he started vomiting on the
    basement floor. It had been too great a luxury for him, he
    ought to have stayed in a thatched hovel. His food consisted of
    rice and treacle, no butter on his bread.</p>

    <p>Yet he was always at his studies; in a single night he read
    a volume of 100 pages; during the week he taught a school he
    had founded for the children teaching them to fear God, and at
    the same time he was busy making drawings of photography and
    the mines.</p>

    <p>On a very hot day a violent thunderstorm burst over our
    region. What did our friend do? He went out to stand in the
    open field to look at the great marvels of God, and so he came
    back wet to the skin. So it came about that our friend was
    turned out of his ministry, he went away to Paris and we have
    not heard from him since. And when he walked [it was always] on
    the edge of the road, dear friend, Monsieur
    Pi&eacute;rard, I could not tell you more, I was only
    fourteen years at the time.</p>

    <p>Some of his characteristics have been remembered vividly.
    When the miners of Wasmes went to the pits, they put old vests
    made of sacking over their linen work clothes, using them like
    pea jackets to protect themselves in the cages, from water
    spurting from the walls of the shafts. This miserable
    raggedness kindled Vincent van Gogh's pity most deeply. One day
    he saw the word <i>fragile</i> printed on the sackcloth on one
    miner's back. He did not laugh. On the contrary, for many days
    he spoke about it compassionately at mealtimes. People did not
    understand. This and the thunderstorm episode were enough to
    convince Madame Denis &ldquo;that the young gentleman was not
    like all the others.&rdquo; Her motherly heart bled for him...
    She wrote a letter to Van Gogh's mother, describing the
    miserable life Vincent led in his cabin.</p>

    <p>An epidemic of typhoid fever had broken out in the district.
    Vincent had given everything, his money and his clothes, to the
    poor sick miners. An inspector of the Evangelization Council
    had come to the conclusion that the missionary's
    <i>&ldquo;exc&egrave;s de z&egrave;le&rdquo;</i>
    bordered on the scandalous, and he did not hide his opinion
    from the consistory of Wasmes. Van Gogh's father went from
    Nuenen [sic] to Wasmes. He found his son lying on a sack filled
    with straw, horribly worn out and emaciated. In the room,
    dimly lit by a lamp hanging from the ceiling, some miners with
    faces pinched with starvation and suffering crowded round
    Vincent. Large, fantastic shadows danced all over the walls
    plastered with green.</p>

    <p>The missionary allowed himself to be led away like a child,
    and returned to the home of Madame Denis.</p>

    <p>Van Gogh made many sensational conversions among the
    Protestants of Wasmes. People still talk of the miner whom he
    went to see after the accident in the Marcasse mine. The man
    was a habitual drinker, &ldquo;an unbeliever and a
    blasphemer,&rdquo; according to the people who told me the
    story. When Vincent entered his house to help and comfort him,
    he was received with a volley of abuse. He was called
    especially a <i>m&acirc;cheux d'capelets</i> [rosary
    chewer], as if he had been a Roman Catholic priest. But Van
    Gogh's evangelical tenderness converted the man.</p>

    <p>People still tell how, at the time of the <i>tirage au
    sort,</i> the drawing of lots for conscription, women begged
    the holy man to show them a passage in the Holy Scripture which
    would serve as a talisman for their sons and ensure their
    drawing a good number and being exempted from service in the
    barracks!...</p>

    <p>Traces of Van Gogh's sojourn in the Borinage are to be found
    in the records of the Protestant communities. One is a report
    of the &ldquo;Eglise du Bois &agrave; Wasmes,&rdquo;
    drawn up under the <i>&rdquo;hauspices (sic) du synode."</i> I
    have copied this report and this is how it reads:</p>

    <p>Monsieur le pasteur Peron, of Dour, has come to Wasmes.
    Considering the number [of members, doubtless] and the works
    they could do, Messieurs Neven, Jean Andry and Peron
    aforenamed, all three pastors of the governing body of the
    St&eacute; Synodale, agreed to send our situation (sic)
    to the Synodal Board in order to learn whether it can come to
    our aid.</p>

    <p>After being commissioned, Mr. Peron came to Wasmes, and
    reaching an agreement, they thought it proper to take turns
    holding the service in a hall which Mr. Peron had visited
    together with the members of the consistory.</p>

    <p>After a lapse of about a year and a half the
    Societ&eacute; Synodale was good enough to send us M.
    Vincent; after him came M. Huton, both of them evangelists
    during four years or thereabouts.</p>

    <p>We have been powerfully assisted in the work of
    evangelization.</p>

    <p>And here is the 1879-80 report of the Union of Protestant
    Churches in Belgium, chapter &ldquo;Wasmes&rdquo; [twenty-third
    report of the Synodal Board of Evangelization (1879-80)]:</p>

    <p>The experiment of accepting the services of a young
    Dutchman, Mr. Vincent van Gogh, who felt himself called to be
    an evangelist in the Borinage, has not produced the anticipated
    results. If a talent for speaking, indispensable to anyone
    placed at the head of a congregation, had been added to the
    admirable qualities he displayed in aiding the sick and
    wounded, to his devotion to the spirit of self-sacrifice, of
    which he gave many proofs by consecrating his night's rest to
    them, and by stripping himself of most of his clothes and linen
    in their behalf, Mr. Van Gogh would certainly have been an
    accomplished evangelist.</p>

    <p>Undoubtedly it would be unreasonable to demand extraordinary
    talents. But it is evident that the absence of certain
    qualities may render the exercise of an evangelist's principal
    function wholly impossible.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately this is the case with Mr. Van Gogh. Therefore,
    the probationary period - some months - having expired, it has
    been necessary to abandon the idea of retaining him any
    longer.</p>

    <p>The evangelist, M. Hutton <i>(sic),</i> who is now
    installed, took over his charge on October 1, 1879.</p>

    <p>1879, the tragic year: epidemics of typhoid fever,
    &ldquo;the mad fever,&rdquo; broke out, and then a great
    catastrophe cast a pall of grief over the country (the firedamp
    explosion in the Agrappe at Frameries). Without a thought for
    himself, Vincent devoted himself to nursing the sick and the
    men suffering from burns, with their faces black and
    swollen.</p>

    <p>A strike broke out; the mutinous miners would no longer
    listen to anyone except &ldquo;l'pasteur Vincent,&rdquo; whom
    they trusted.</p>

    <p>In the meantime Van Gogh was increasingly busy with his
    drawings. One day he started for Brussels on foot. He arrived
    at Pastor Pietersen's house in rags, his feet bleeding, but
    carrying with him some of his drawings (Pietersen was an
    amateur watercolourist). The reception was cordial and
    soothing. It was decided that Van Gogh would go back to the
    Borinage, but this time to another parish, Cuesmes.</p>

    <p>One of my Protestant fellow citizens, M. G. Delsaut, who
    knew him at Cuesmes in 1880, sent me some notes which I
    reproduce without a word changed:</p>

    <p>He was an intelligent young man, speaking little - always
    pensive. <label subject="food-and-drink.preference">He lived very soberly: when he got up in the morning,
    he breakfasted off two slices of dry bread and drank a cold cup
    of black coffee.</p>

    <p>Apart from his meals, he drank only water. He always had his
    meals alone, and took pains to avoid eating in company. While
    eating, he made drawings in his lap or he read.</label> All his spare
    time was given to drawing. He often went to Ghlin Wood, to the
    cemetery of Mons, or into the country.</p>

    <p>He drew chiefly landscapes, castles, a shepherd with his
    flock, cows in the meadows.</p>

    <p>The most striking picture, which my sister-in-law, with whom
    he boarded, still remembers, was a drawing showing the family
    gathering in the crop of potatoes, some digging, others (the
    women) picking up the potatoes.</p>

    <p>He left his drawings and his books behind, but now they have
    all disappeared because the family was scattered.</p>

    <p>His board was paid by his father, who sent him money. He
    spent much money on Bibles and New Testaments, which he gave
    away when he went out to draw.</p>

    <p>Once his father had to come to Cuesmes to put a stop to his
    spending money on books.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.appearance">He would set out to draw, a campstool under his arm and his
    box of drawing materials on his back, like a peddler.</p>

    <p>When he was annoyed he rubbed his hands as if he could not
    stop.</label></p>

    <p>[In the <i>Groene Amsterdammer</i> (Amsterdam weekly) of
    September 19, 1925<b>,</b> Pi&eacute;rard added the
    following to his account.]</p>

    <p>I thought I had collected all the particulars, until old Mr.
    Denis, whom I met some days ago, told me that one fine morning,
    when, as he put it, &ldquo;the dew had, as it were, strewn the
    trees and flowers in the garden with pearls of silver,&rdquo;
    he was on the point of crushing a caterpillar underfoot when
    Van Gogh stopped him with the exclamation, &ldquo;Why do you
    want to kill that little animal? God created it...&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Louis Pi&eacute;rard used to be the socialist senator
    for Hainaut, the province to which the Borinage belongs; after
    the liberation (1918) he was sometimes called the cultural
    ambassador of Belgium. To my question as to what grounds he had
    for his statements about Vincent's alleged endeavours to calm
    the strikers, he wrote the following letter a few weeks before
    his death.</p>

    <p>Club des &eacute;crivains belges de langue
    fran&ccedil;aise.</p>

    <p>Pen Club</p>

    <p>President: Louis Pi&eacute;rard</p>

    <p>47, av. Victor Rousseau, Forest (Brux.)</p>

    <p>telephone 44.39.17.</p>

    <p>Dear Mr. Van Gogh, Brussels, October 8, 1951</p>

    <p>I hasten to answer your letter of October 4. I am happy to
    hear that you are preparing a new edition of <i>The</i>
    <i>Letters of Vincent</i>. Thank you for kindly conferring
    importance on the particulars I gave in my book on Van Gogh's
    sojourn in the Borinage.</p>

    <p>The catastrophe to which I referred, and in the course of
    which Vincent exerted himself with the utmost unselfishness
    (which is confirmed by Pastor Bonte's letter), was one of those
    firedamp explosions that occurred again and again in the
    Agrappe Pit at Frameries, near Wasmes. There were hundreds of
    victims. Most of them were miners, killed on the spot by the
    explosion. But others, the wounded, were possibly burned by
    ignition of the coal dust.</p>

    <p>Vincent tried to relieve the atrocious sufferings of these
    unfortunate wretches, applying compresses drenched in olive oil
    to their burns.</p>

    <p>These frequent mining disasters (there had been three, one
    after the other, at the Agrappe and at the Boule) at last
    prompted an outbreak of anger and mutiny among the mining
    population. They believed that the inspection of the mines was
    not conducted in such a way as to protect the miner and
    guarantee his safety. So there were strikes which were in fact
    strikes of despair. Because of this, the strikers were tempted
    to commit acts of violence and destruction. The gendarmes and
    even the army were mobilized to maintain order. It is highly
    probable <sup>2</sup> that, in order to prevent bloodshed,
    Vincent intervened and used his great moral authority to
    restore the miners' self-control.</p>

    <p>I would also allude to the depth at which people have to
    work in the mines. Do you know that there is a pit at Quaregnon
    in which <i>at this very hour</i> people are working at a depth
    of 1400 meters (about 4,700 ft.) ?</p>

    <p>Will you please give my kind regards to Mrs. Van Gogh.</p>

    <p>Bien a vous</p>

    <p>Louis Pi&eacute;rard,</p>

    <p>47, av. V. Rousseau, Bruxelles</p>

    <p><i>Postscript:</i></p>

    <p>You of course know the documentary about Vincent van Gogh
    which won an award at the Film Festival in Venice. But what has
    become of those many projects for films on Van Gogh, his life
    and work?</p>

    <p>During an exhibition of Vincent's pictures at Mons (Dec.
    1946 - Jan. 1947), I received the following letter:</p>

    <p>To Mr. V. W. van Gogh,</p>

    <p>Laren.</p>

    <p>A few notes on the subject of V. van Gogh's life at Wasmes,
    collected by my grandmother from Mr. and Mrs. Denis (my
    grandmother came from Wasmes, Borinage)</p>

    <p>To Esther (Madame Denis, who expostulated with him for
    tearing up his linen so that he could take it to families where
    there were sufferers from firedamp burns):</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, Esther, the good Samaritan did more than that!
    Why not apply in life what one admires in the pages of the
    Bible?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>To the same, who expostulated with him for dashing out of
    the house in the morning to the unfortunate victims, without
    taking the time to wash himself or to lace his shoes:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Oh, Esther, don't worry about such details, there is
    nothing for heaven in them.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>To the same, who expostulated with him for leaving her
    hospitable home to go and sleep on a miserable pallet in the
    hovel of a needy family:</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Esther, one should do like the good God; from time to
    time one should go and live among His own.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The original French letter is grammatically and
        orthographically an amusing document indeed!</p>

        <p>The word &ldquo;probable&rdquo; (vraisemblable)
        indicates that this is only Louis Pi&eacute;rard's
        supposition. It has already found its way into one film
        script, not a little inflated by promoting Vincent to
        strike leader.</p>
