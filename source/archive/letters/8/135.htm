  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I received in good order the prints, etchings, etc., which
    you sent me some time ago, and I thank you very much. You did
    me a great service by sending them.</p>

    <p>I can tell you that I have sketched the ten sheets of
    &ldquo;Les Travaux des Champs&rdquo; by Millet (almost the size
    of a page in Cours de Dessin Bargue), and that I have
    completely finished one. I should have done more, but first I
    wanted to make the Exercices au Fusain by Bargue, which Mr.
    Tersteeg has kindly lent me, and I have now finished the sixty
    sheets. In addition, I have made a drawing of &ldquo;Evening
    Prayer,&rdquo; after the etching which you sent me.</p>

    <p>I wish I could show them to you and get your opinion of all
    this, as well as of some other drawings - for instance, a large
    sepia drawing after Th. Rousseau, &ldquo;Four dans les
    Landes.&rdquo; [Oven in the Landes - vast plain south of
    Bordeaux.] I had already done it twice in watercolour before I
    succeeded in finishing it. As I told you before, I should like
    very much to copy &ldquo;Le Buisson&rdquo; by Ruysdael too; you
    know those two landscapes are in the same style and
    sentiment.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I have been making rough sketches of these drawings without
    advancing very much, but lately it seems to be improving, and I
    am hopeful that it will improve even more.</label> Especially because
    Mr. Tersteeg and also you have come to my aid with good models,
    for at present I think it is much better to copy some good
    things than to work without this foundation. Yet I could not
    keep from sketching in a rather large size the drawing of the
    miners going to the shaft which I sent you a hasty sketch of,
    though I changed the placement of the figures a little. I hope
    that after having copied the other two series by Bargue, I
    shall be able to draw miners, male and female, more or less
    well, if by chance I can have a model with some character; and
    as to that, there are plenty of them.</p>

    <p>The lithograph after Bosboom's &ldquo;Interior of a
    Cowshed&rdquo; is very beautiful. You understood my intentions
    perfectly when you added &ldquo;La Malaria&rdquo; by
    H&eacute;bert to the collection.</p>

    <p>If you still have the book with the etchings after Michel,
    please lend me that sometime, too, but there is no hurry. For
    the moment I have enough to keep me busy, but I should like to
    see those landscapes again, for now I look at things with
    different eyes than I did before I began to draw.</p>

    <p>I hope that you will not be too dissatisfied with the
    drawings after Millet when you see them; those little wood
    engraving are admirable.</p>

    <p>As I already have twenty prints after Millet, you can
    understand that if you could send me some more, I would make
    them readily, for I try to study that master seriously. I know
    that the large etching of &ldquo;The Diggers&rdquo; is rare,
    but be on the lookout for it, and tell me what it will cost.
    Someday or other I shall earn a few pennies with some drawings
    of miners; I should like to have that print and &ldquo;Le
    Buisson&rdquo; as soon as I am able to buy it, even if it is
    rather expensive. The other day I bought for 2.50 francs two
    volumes of the Mus&eacute;e Universel, in which I found a large
    number of interesting woodcuts, including three of
    Millet's.</p>

    <p>I cannot tell you the pleasure Mr. Tersteeg gave me by
    letting me have the Exercices au Fusain and the Cours de Dessin
    Bargue for a while. I worked almost a whole fortnight on the
    former, from early morning until night, and daily I seem to
    feel that it invigorates my pencil. With no less eagerness - in
    fact, more - I am now copying &ldquo;Les Travaux des
    Champs.&rdquo; I am now working on &ldquo;The Sheep
    Shearers.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Once more my heartfelt thanks for having sent them;
    everything you can find by that artist will be of the greatest
    use to me. I have already drawn &ldquo;The Sower&rdquo; five
    times, twice in small size, three times in large, and I will
    take it up again, I am so entirely absorbed in that figure.</p>

    <p>Whenever you write to me (which would be a very welcome
    distraction), could you tell me something about the etchings by
    A. Legros? If I remember correctly, I saw a dozen of them in
    England, and they were very beautiful. This is all for today.
    Thanking you again, and with a handshake,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Accept my congratulations on the occasion of September
    10.</p>

    <p>C/o Charles Decrucq,</p>

    <p>3 Rue du Pavillon,</p>

    <p>Cuesmes, near Mons</p>

    <p>These are the Millets I have:</p>

    <p>The Sower</p>

    <p>Angelus</p>

    <p>Reapers Binding the Sheaves</p>

    <p>Woodcutter and his Wife in the Wood</p>

    <p>Fields in Winter</p>

    <p>Young Farmer</p>

    <p>Les travaux des Champs, 10 sheets</p>

    <p>The Four Hours of the Day, 4 sheets</p>

    <p>Do you still have an old woodcutter alone in the wood in
    your collection of wood engravings?</p>
