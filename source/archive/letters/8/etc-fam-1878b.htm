    <p>From Reverend Van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>20 December 1878</p>

    <p>Eight days ago we received a rather nice letter from
    Vincent; nice in so far as he seems to have found a good
    boarding house with farmers in P&acirc;turages for thirty
    francs a month, the reason that it is not much being that he
    teaches the children in the evening. He was soon accepted with
    goodwill by many people, and working with these people seems to
    give him satisfaction. Furthermore, the Reverend P&eacute;ron
    has promised him his cooperation. In the middle of January
    there will be another meeting of the committee of with Mr.
    P&eacute;ron is the secretary, and he promised him that he
    would try to do something for him.</p>

    <p><label content="business.sales">In the meantime, he spends his free moments drawing big maps
    of Palestine which can be used for talks and catechism, and
    with which he tries to make some money. I received one and
    ordered him to make four more copies for which I gave him ten
    francs each.</label></p>
