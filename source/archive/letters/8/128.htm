    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I heard from Father and mother that you paid them a surprise
    visit recently,<label content="attitude.father"> just after Father came to visit me. I am very
    glad Father came.</label> Together we visited the three clergymen of
    the Borinage, and walked in the snow, and visited a miner's
    family, we saw the coal being bought up out of a mine called
    Les Trois Diefs [The Three Mounds]; Father also attended two
    Bible classes, so we did a great deal in those few days. I
    think that Father has been impressed with the Borinage and that
    he will not easily forget it; no one who visits this curious,
    remarkable and picturesque region can.</p>

    <p>It is a long time since I wrote you. If with God's help my
    work here is a success, you must come to see me someday,
    perhaps when you have to go to Paris again or when you take a
    business trip.</p>

    <p>The other day I found a list of all the coal veins south of
    Mons, 155 in all, in the house of an elderly man who has worked
    in the mines for many years. The country and the inhabitants
    charm me more every day. One has a homelike feeling here, like
    on the heath, or in the dunes; the people have something simple
    and good. Those who leave are homesick for their country; on
    the other hand, homesick foreigners lose their nostalgia for
    their own country and adapt easily.</p>

    <p>How are Mauve and Maris? Have you seen many pictures
    recently? Spring is near, and it will bring fresh subject
    material. What has Isra&euml;ls been doing this winter? They
    would find so many things here that would appeal to them. When
    the cart drawn by the white horse [l'blanc ch'val] brings an
    injured man home from the mines, one sees things that remind
    one of &ldquo;The castaway&rdquo; by Isra&euml;ls: every moment
    there is something which moves one intensely.</p>

    <p>Write again soon, and when you tell me something about
    painters, remember that I am still capable of understanding it,
    though I have not seen any pictures in a long time.</p>

    <p>I have rented a small house that I would like to make my
    home, but now it serves only as a workshop or study; Father,
    and I too, think it preferable that I lodge with Denis. Still,
    I have some of my things there, including some prints on the
    wall. I must go out to visit a few of the sick, and some others
    as well.</p>

    <p>Have a good time, and write me soon. Remember me to Mauve
    when you see him, and the Roos family.</p>

    <p>Spring is coming, for the larks are singing, and in the wood
    the branches and buds are beginning to sprout, especially on
    the alder trees. When Father was here, everything was covered
    with snow, so that he has seen the curious effect of the black
    charbonnages and the many black chimneys in the snow. There are
    many places here that remind one of that drawing by Bosboom,
    &ldquo;Chaudfontaine.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&Agrave; Dieu, a handshake in thought, and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
