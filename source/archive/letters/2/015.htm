    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I have received your gift, included in a letter to me, of a
    guilder intended for the purchase of a pair of cuff links. I
    thank you very cordially, old man, but you should not have, I
    have more money than necessary.</p>

    <p>Thanks for the letter which I received this morning. I was
    very glad to hear that Mauve is engaged to Jet Carbentus. That
    is fine&hellip;I was pleased to hear that you are doing so
    well.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">You have done well to read the book by Burger; you should
    devour books on art as much as possible, especially The Gazette
    de Beaux-Arts, etc.</label> By all means try to get a good knowledge of
    pictures. That picture by Apol we have here now is good, but
    last year he painted the same subject and I thought it was
    better and brighter than this one.</p>

    <p>I am glad that you go to see Uncle Cor now and then; he has
    pictures and prints which you can never see at the house in The
    Hague.</p>

    <p>I, too, am very busy just now and am glad of it, for that is
    what I want. &Agrave; Dieu, boy, keep in good spirits. I wish
    you well. Greetings to Iterson.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
