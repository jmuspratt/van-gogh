  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter. I don't want the book just now; take
    your time and send it back when you have finished it. I have
    not read the book by Van Vloten, but I should like to see it. I
    have read another book on art by Van Vloten, and did not quite
    agree with him, though it was very learned. Burger is simpler,
    and whatever he says is true.</p>

    <p>I am glad you have been in Amsterdam. When you see him, will
    you thank Uncle Cor for the pamphlet he sent me? I am glad you
    feel so comfortable at Roos's.<label content="attitude.women"> As I already let you know
    through Anna Carbentus, you are quite right about those
    priggish girls. I also agree with you about Bertha Haanebeek;
    but watch your heart, boy.</label></p>

    <p>Have you seen Mr. Jacobson's collection yet? He will
    certainly ask you to come to see it, and it is well worth
    while. Give him my respects and tell him I am doing quite well
    here and that I see many beautiful things.</p>

    <p>I am all right and am very busy. Thank Willem for his letter
    and greet everybody at Roos's and Iterson and anybody who may
    ask after me. Best regards.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
