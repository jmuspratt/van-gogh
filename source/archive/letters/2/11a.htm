    <p>[Letter to the Van Stockum-Haanebeek family]</p>

    <p>London, October 1873</p>

    <p>Dear Carolien and Willem,</p>

    <p>Many thanks for your letter of this morning, it was a
    delightful surprise. I am glad you are doing so well.</p>

    <p>Our Anna has passed her English and her needlework
    examinations; you can imagine how delighted she is, as are we
    all. Pa and Mother have proposed that she stay at school until
    next April, and then try French; but she doesn't have to if she
    doesn't want to. I should like so much to find something for
    her here; you know we have occasionally spoken about it.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">You have already heard that Theo is going to The Hague. I
    believe it will be a change for the better, though he will find
    it hard to leave that beautiful, pleasant Brussels.</label></p>

    <p>Some time ago I received a letter from your Pa, also, to
    which I have replied, and so you will probably have heard that
    all is still going well with me here, and some particulars
    about my new lodgings.</p>

    <p>What you say about winter is quite right; I completely
    agree. For myself, I can hardly decide which season I like
    best; I believe I like them all equally. It is worth noting
    that the old painters hardly ever painted autumn, and that the
    modern ones have a predilection for it.</p>

    <p>Enclosed are a few small photographs, which I hope you will
    like. Here you see hardly any albums like those in Holland, but
    so-called scrapbooks into which you put photographs like the
    ones in this letter (that is why we have the photographs
    unmounted here). The advantage is that you can arrange your
    photographs on the same page any way you like. I advise you to
    get a sort of copybook with white paper, and begin by putting
    these in it.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;A Baptism&rdquo; is after Anker, a Swiss who has
    painted a variety of subjects, all equally intimate and
    delicate of feeling. &ldquo;Puritans Going to Church&rdquo; is
    after Boughton, one of the best painters here. An American, he
    likes Longfellow very much, and rightly so; I know three
    pictures by him inspired by The Courtship of Miles
    Standish. Seeing these pictures has induced me to read
    Miles Standish and Evangeline again; I don't know why, but I
    never realized these poems were <i>so</i> fine as I think them
    now.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Le bon fr&eacute;re&rdquo; is after Van Muyden, a
    Swiss painter, &ldquo;encore plus de modestie que de
    talent&rdquo; [more modesty than talent as yet]. Mr. Post in
    The Hague has this picture. If you should ever come to our
    shop, ask them to show you his (Van Muyden's)
    &ldquo;Refectoire.&rdquo; There are no more than four or five
    copies of this photograph in existence, as the negative is
    broken. Show it to Mr. Tersteeg some time.</p>

    <p>The &ldquo;Lune de Miel&rdquo; [The Honeymoon] is after
    Eugene Feyen, one of the few painters who pictures intimate
    modern life as it really is, and does not turn it into fashion
    plates.</p>

    <p>I know the photograph &ldquo;Der Wirthin
    T&ouml;chterlein&rdquo; [The Landlady's Little Daughter], and I
    admire it very much. It is a good thing you appreciate
    Bourguereau. Not everybody is capable of perceiving the good
    and the beautiful as keenly as you do.</p>

    <p>And now I am going to stop; I enclose another picture of
    autumn, this one by Michelet.</p>

    <p>I hope you will be able to read this; I have written on
    without considering that one must take care a letter is
    intelligible. &Agrave; Dieu; the best of luck to you all; many
    kind regards to all at the Poten, and any other friends you may
    meet.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>[Enclosure]</p>

    <p>Je vois d'ici une dame, je la vois marcher pensive dans un
    jardin peu &eacute;tendu, et d&eacute;fleuri de bonne heure,
    mais abrit&eacute;, comme on en voit derri&egrave;re nos
    falaises en France, ou les dunes de la Hollande. Les arbustes
    exotiques cont d&eacute;j&agrave; rentr&eacute;s dans la serre.
    Les feuilles tomb&eacute;es d&eacute;voilent quelques statues.
    Luxe d'art qui contraste un peu avec la tr&egrave;s-simple
    toilette de la dame, modeste, grave, o&ugrave; la soie noire
    (ou grise) s'&eacute;gaye &agrave; peine d'un simple ruban
    lilas&hellip;</p>

    <p>Mais ne l'ai-je pas vue d&eacute;j&agrave; aux mus&eacute;es
    d'Amsterdam ou de La Haye? Elle me rapelle une dame de Phillipe
    de Champagne (n.v. au Louvres) qui m'&eacute;tait entr&eacute;e
    dans le coeur, si candide, si honn&ecirc;te, suffisamment
    intelligente, siimple pourtant, sans finesse pour se
    d&eacute;m&ecirc;ler des ruses du monde. Cette femme m'est
    rest&eacute;e trente ann&eacute;es, me revenant
    obstin&eacute;ment, m'inqui&eacute;tant, me faisant dire
    &ldquo;Mais comment se nommait elle? Qui lui est-il
    arriv&eacute;? A-t-elle eu un peu de bonheur? Et comment se
    nommmait s'est elle tir&eacute;e de la vie?&rdquo;</p>

    <p>[From here I see a lady, I see her walk pensively in a not
    very large garden, bereft of its flowers early in the season,
    but sheltered, as you see them behind our cliffs in France or
    the dunes of Holland. The exotic shrubs have already been put
    back in the conservatory. The fallen leaves reveal a number of
    statues. An artistic luxury which contrasts with the lady's
    very simple, modest, dignified dress, of which the black (or
    grey) silk is almost imperceptibly brightened by a lilac
    ribbon.</p>

    <p>But haven't I seen her already in the museums of Amsterdam
    or The Hague? She reminds me of the lady by Philippe de
    Champagne (N.B. in the Louvre), who took my heart, so candid,
    so honest, sufficiently intelligent, yet simple, without the
    cunning to extricate herself from the ruses of the world. This
    woman has remained in my mind for thirty years, persistently
    coming back to me, making me say: &ldquo;But what was she
    called? What has happened to her? Has she known some happiness?
    And how has she overcome the difficulties of the
    world?&rdquo;]</p>

    l'autonne&rdquo;</p>
