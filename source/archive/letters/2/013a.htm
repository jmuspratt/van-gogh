    <p>[To Carolien van Stockum-Haanebeek]</p>

    <p>My dear Carolien,</p>

    <p>I feel the urge to write you a few words. <label content="feelings.nostalgia">How nice were the
    days &ldquo;<i>wenn </i>[<i>sic</i>] <i>wir zusammen
    waren</i>&rdquo; [when we were together]; rest assured that I
    never forget you, but I am not such a good hand at
    letter-writing as I should like to be.</label> I live a rich life here,
    `having nothing yet possessing all.' At times I am inclined to
    believe that I am gradually turning into a cosmopolite; that
    is, neither a Dutchman, nor an Englishman, nor yet a Frenchman,
    but simply a <i>man</i>. And as a homeland, the whole world,
    i.e. a small spot in the world where we are sent to stay. We
    have not got there yet, though I am straining after it, and
    perhaps may grasp it. And as my ideal, what Mauve called,
    &ldquo;That is <i>it</i>.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Old girl, &agrave; Dieu.</p>

    <p>Yours truly, Vincent</p>

    <p>A handshake for you and Willem, like old times, till your
    fingers hurt.</p>
