    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>In my letter to Uncle Hein I enclose a little note for you.
    I wonder if you were in Helvoirt for Mother's birthday and how
    you enjoyed it.</p>

    <p>Did you get my letter and the lithograph after Weissenbruch
    which I put in the box with the pictures? Oh! Old man, I so
    want that you come here to see my new lodgings, the one I have
    already spoken about to you. I now have a bedroom such as I
    always longed for, without a sloping ceiling and without blue
    wallpaper with green fringes. I lodge with some charming people
    now; they keep a school for little boys.</p>

    <p>One Saturday some time ago, I went boating on the Thames, in
    the company of two Englishmen. It was glorious.</p>

    <p>Yesterday I saw an exhibition of Belgian art, where I
    noticed many of the same pictures that were at the Brussels
    exhibition. There were several beautiful things by Alb. and
    Julien de Vriendt, Cluysenaer, Wauters, Coosemans, Gabriel, De
    Schampheleer, etc. Have you ever seen anything by Terlinden? If
    so, tell me about it. It was a real pleasure to see those
    Belgian pictures; the English ones are with a few exceptions
    very bad and uninteresting. Some time ago I saw one which
    represented a kind of fish or dragon, six yards long. It was
    awful. And then a little man, who came to kill the
    above-mentioned dragon. I think the whole represented
    &ldquo;The Archangel Michael, Killing Satan.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Adieu, boy, best wishes and write soon,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Another English picture is &ldquo;Satan Possessing the Herd
    of Swine at the Lake of Gadarena.&rdquo; It represented about
    fifty black pigs and swine running helter-skelter down the
    mountain, and skipping over one another into the sea. But there
    was a very clever picture by Prinsep.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">I just received your letter. Going to The Hague will be a
    great change for you. I imagine it will be hard to leave
    beautiful, pleasant Brussels, but you will enjoy The Hague,
    too. </label>Thanks for what you wrote me about the pictures. That
    picture by Millet must have been splendid. &Agrave; Dieu, I
    will write soon again.</p>
