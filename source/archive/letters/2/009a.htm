    <p>[Letter to The Van Stockum - Haanebeek family; the envelope
    is addressed to W. J. van Stockum, Esq., Varkensmarkt, The
    Hague.]</p>

    <p>Dear friends,</p>

    <p>I should have liked to write sooner, and now I will not
    postpone it any longer. How are you? I heard that your house
    has been smartened up, and that all is well with you. I hope
    very much you will drop me a line when you have a moment to
    spare.</p>

    <p>All is well with me. I see much that is new and beautiful,
    and have been fortunate in finding a good boardinghouse, so
    that on the whole I feel quite at home already.<label content="Feelings.nostalgia"> Yet I do not
    forget The Hague, and should very, very much like to spend an
    evening in the Poten, and look in on you, too.</label></p>

    <p>The business here is only a stockroom, and our work is quite
    different from what it is in The Hague; but I shall probably
    get used to it. At six o'clock my work is already done for the
    day, so that I have a nice bit of time for myself, which I
    spend pleasantly - taking walks, reading and letter
    writing.</p>

    <p>The neighbourhood where I live is quite beautiful, and so
    quiet and intimate that you almost forget you are in London. In
    front of every house there is a small garden with flowers or a
    few trees, and many houses are built very tastefully in a sort
    of Gothic style. Still, I have a good half-hour's walk to get
    to the country.</p>

    <p>We have a piano in the sitting room, and there are also
    three Germans living here who are very fond of music, which is
    very pleasant.</p>

    <p>One of the finest sights I have seen is Rotten Row in Hyde
    Park, where hundreds of ladies and gentlemen ride on
    horseback.</p>

    <p>In all parts of the town there are beautiful parks with a
    wealth of flowers such as I have never seen anywhere else.</p>

    <p>Enclosed I am sending you a copy of a poem by Van Beers,
    which you possibly do not know. Our Elisabeth copied it for me
    on my last evening in Helvoirt because she knew I thought so
    much of it. It is genuine Brabant: I thought you would read it
    with pleasure, and therefore I copied it for you.</p>

    <p>It was very considerate of your sister Marie to send me the
    announcement. I long to hear something of the wedding, and I
    congratulate you all.</p>

    <p>Will you kindly let me have a list of your birthdays some
    time? I did have one, but lost it.</p>

    <p>And now good-by; remember me to everybody in the Poten, and
    good luck to you all. Excuse the bad handwriting; it is late
    and time to go to bed.</p>

    <p>Sleep well.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    DE AVONDSTOND<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    Langzaam galmde `t gesamp der beelok over de velden,<br>

    Die, volzalig, in `t goud van de avondzonne zich
    baadden&hellip;<br>


    <p>[Literal translation]</p>

    <blockquote><blockquote>

    THE EVENING HOUR<br>

    </blockquote></blockquote>

    The toll of the curfew calling to prayer resounded lazily
    across the fields,<br>

    Which blissfully lay bathed in the gold of the evening
    sun.<br>

    Right in front of him lay the village, with hills to the
    north and to the south,<br>

    between whose ridges the sun, sinking in the west with a
    crimson blush,<br>

    poured forth its whole wealth of colours and the magic of
    its rays.<br>

    Now the little bell in the grey steeple veiled in dark
    green<br>

    was silent. The brown sails of the mills, on yonder
    height,<br>

    hung motionless; the foliage was still; and over the
    cottages<br>

    little puffs of peat-smoke, tinged with blue, rose so
    straight<br>

    from the chimneys that they too seemed to hang motionless in
    the tingling air.<br>

    After the sun's good night kiss it was as if this hamlet,
    this field, these hills,<br>

    everything around, silent and grateful, once more
    recalled<br>

    the richness and peace they had enjoyed,<br>

    before wrapping themselves in the cloak of evening dew to
    sleep.<br>

    <p></p>

    Farther on&hellip;but just beside the narrow footpath<br>

    followed by the Painter, the sudden loud peal of cheering
    met his ears.<br>

    Swaying to and fro, a wagon came rumbling toward him,<br>

    piled high with the harvest of buckwheat.<br>

    Horse and freight were decked with fluttering ribbons and
    flowering branches;<br>

    children, each with a wreath of flowers around his little
    flaxen head,<br>

    sat atop it, brandishing alder twigs,<br>

    or raining down a shower of leaves and flowers,<br>

    whilst below, around the wagon, a crowd of servant lads and
    lasses<br>

    leaped and sang, so as to startle the whole slumbering
    plain.<br>

    Behind the shrubs, the silently smiling Painter watched<br>

    the noisy throng wind its way along the bumpy road.<br>

    And thus, pondering the calm and deep delight the soul<br>

    savours in the country, or with his artist's mind
    reconstructing<br>

    in silent rapture the whole glorious scene of a short while
    ago,<br>

    he came, without perceiving it himself, sauntering into the
    hamlet.<br>

    In the west the purple and yellow had already faded to
    grey;<br>

    and in the east, quite close to the little church, the full
    copper-coloured<br>

    disk of the moon, lightly shrouded in the haze of the
    gloaming, had risen<br>

    when he entered &ldquo;The Swan,&rdquo; the inn where he was
    lodging.<br>
