    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>My address is c/o Messrs. Goupil &amp; Co., 17 Southampton
    Street, Strand, London. You must be eager to hear from me, so I
    will not keep you waiting any longer for a letter.</p>

    <p>I hear from home that you are living with Mr. Schmidt now
    and that Father has been to see you. I certainly hope this will
    please you better than your former boardinghouse, and I'm sure
    it will.</p>

    <p>I am very anxious for a letter; write me soon, and tell me
    how you spend your day, etc. You must tell me especially what
    pictures you have seen lately, and also if any new etchings or
    lithographs have been published. Let me know as much as you can
    about these things, for I do not see much of them here as it is
    only a wholesale house.</p>

    <p>Considering the circumstances, I am doing pretty well.<label content="attitude.people"> So
    far the boardinghouse where I am staying pleases me. There are
    also three German boarders who are very fond of music, they
    play the piano and sing, so we spend very pleasant evenings
    together.</label> I am not so busy here as I was in The Hague; I work
    only from nine in the morning to six in the evening, and on
    Saturdays we close at four o'clock. I live in one of the
    suburbs of London, where it is relatively quiet. It reminds me
    of Tilburg or some such place.</p>

    <p>I spent some very pleasant days in Paris, and, as you can
    imagine, I enjoyed all the beautiful things I saw at the
    exhibition and in the Louvre and the Luxembourg. The house in
    Paris is splendid and much bigger than I had thought,
    especially the one in the Place de l'Opera <sup>1</sup>.</p>

    <p>Life is very expensive here, my accommodation alone costs me
    eighteen shillings by week, washing excepted, and then I still
    have to take my dinner in the city. Last Sunday I went to the
    country with Mr. Obach, my principal, to Boxhill; it is a high
    hill about six hours by road from London, partially chalky and
    overgrown with box and on one side a wood of high oak trees.
    The country is beautiful here, quite different from Holland or
    Belgium. Everywhere you see charming parks with high trees and
    shrubs. Everyone is allowed to walk there. At Easter, I made an
    interesting excursion with the Germans, but these gentlemen
    spend a great deal of money and I shall not go out with them in
    the future.</p>

    <p>I was glad to hear from home that Uncle Hein's health is
    good. Give him and Aunt my best and tell them something about
    me. Give my compliments to Mr. Schmidt and Eduard and write to
    me soon. &Agrave; Dieu, best wishes,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

        <p>Goupil had three branches in Paris, the main branch was
        on the Rue Chaptal, another on Boulevard Montmartre, of
        which Theo became the head later on, and a third branch was
        on the Place de l'Opera.</p>
