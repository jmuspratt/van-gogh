  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Many happy returns of your birthday, &ldquo;Do well and
    don't look back, then all will come right.&rdquo;
    <sup>1</sup></p>

    <p>I was glad to receive your last letter. A few days ago I
    sent you a photograph, &ldquo;Young Girl with a Sword&rdquo; by
    Jacquet, as I thought you would like to have it.</p>

    <p>The picture by Van Gorkom is not very dirty. (Entre nous, I
    have not seen it, but tell him I said it was not very dirty.)
    How are Mauve and Jet? Tell me about them.</p>

    <p>I am glad you visit the Haanebeeks often. When I return to
    Holland, I will stop for some days in The Hague, because for me
    The Hague is like a second home to me. (I will stay at your
    place.)</p>

    <p>I would have liked to accompany you on this walk to the
    Vink. I seize every opportunity to make a tour of the area but,
    for the moment, I am very busy. It is very beautiful here
    (although it is in the city). Lilac, hawthorns and laburnums
    flower in all gardens; the chestnut trees are splendid.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">He that sincerely loves nature, finds pleasure everywhere.
    Nevertheless I miss Holland, especially Helvoirt.</label></p>

    <p>I am very busy gardening now, I have sown scented peas,
    poppies and daisies; I have nothing more to do than to wait to
    see what they will give.</p>

    <p>I have to tell that I am happy every morning to have to walk
    the distance between my accommodation and the shop and, in the
    evening, that between the shop and my accommodation, it is a
    good three-quarters of an hour walk each time.</p>

    <p>It is a fine thing that business finishes so early; the
    office closes at six o'clock, and yet there is no less work
    done. My compliments to all the friends, especially to
    Tersteeg, Haanebeek and Carbentus, also to everyone at Uncle
    Pompe's because they are going to Kampen, and to Mr. Bakhuyzen.
    Best wishes.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>The apple trees have blossomed beautifully; I think
    everything is earlier here than in Holland.</p>

    <p>As soon as I know anything more definite about my going
    home, I shall write at once. I am afraid, however, that I shall
    not be able to go for at least four weeks. Write soon.</p>
