    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>&ldquo;He that is without sin among you, let him cast a
    stone at her.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>So keep to your own ideas, and if you doubt whether they are
    right, test them with those of Him who dared to say, &ldquo;I
    am the truth,&rdquo; or with those of some very human person,
    Michelet, for instance&hellip;</p>

    <p>Virginity of soul and impurity of body can go together. You
    know the &ldquo;Margaret at the Fountain,&rdquo; by Ary
    Scheffer, is there a purer being than that girl &ldquo;who
    loved so much&rdquo;?</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Leys n'est pas un imitateur mais un semblable&rdquo;
    [Leys is not an imitator but a similar one] is a true saying
    that struck me too. One might say the same of Tissot's
    pictures, of his &ldquo;Walk in the Snow,&rdquo; &ldquo;Walk on
    the Ramparts,&rdquo; &ldquo;Marguerite in Church,&rdquo;
    etc.</p>

    <p>With the money I gave you, you must buy Alphonse Karr's
    Voyage autour de mon jardin. Be sure to do that - I want you to
    read it.</p>

    <p>Anna and I walk every evening. Autumn is coming fast and
    that makes nature more serious and more intimate still. We are
    going to move to a house quite covered in ivy; I will soon
    write more from there. Compliments to anyone who may inquire
    after me.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
