    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Yesterday a box was sent to The Hague, in which I enclosed a
    photograph of a picture by J. Maris and also, as I promised,
    &ldquo;Der Wirthin T&ouml;chterlein.&rdquo; I hope you will put
    them both up in your room. In the same box is a photograph of a
    picture by Thijs Maris, for Mr. Tersteeg. Sch&uuml;ller in
    Paris sent me six copies of both, which I needed for presents;
    I have none to spare of the Thijs Maris.</p>

    <p>Anna and I arrived safely in London and hope we shall find
    something for her here. I do not say it will be easy, but every
    day she is here she learns something, and at all events I think
    there is more chance for her to find something here than in
    Holland. <label content="attitude.family">It is a great pleasure for me to walk with her through
    the streets in the evening.</label> I find everything again as
    beautiful as when I saw it the first time. Good luck to you,
    boy, and give my compliments to the Rooses, Haanebeeks and
    Carbentuses when you see them. I am learning to swim.</p>

    <p>Write to me whether you have already read in Michelet
    <sup>1</sup> and what you think about it. To me that book was a
    revelation. &Agrave; Dieu.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
