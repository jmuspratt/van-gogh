    <p>London, 25 Bedford Street, Strand 6</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your letter. I copied in your little book
    &ldquo;Meeresstille&rdquo; [Calm Sea] by Heine, didn't I? Some
    time ago I saw a picture by Thijs Maris that reminded me of it.
    It represents an old Dutch town with rows of brownish-red
    houses with stepped gables and high stoops; grey roofs; and
    white or yellow doors, window frames and cornices. There are
    canals with ships and a large white drawbridge under which a
    barge with a man at the tiller passes the little house of the
    bridge-keeper, who is seen through the window, sitting alone in
    his little office. Farther on is a stone bridge across the
    canal, over which some people and a cart with white horses are
    passing.</p>

    <p>And there is life everywhere: a porter with his wheelbarrow;
    a man leaning against the railing of the bridge and looking
    into the water; women in black with white bonnets.</p>

    <p>In the foreground is a brick-paved quay with a black rail;
    in the distance a church spire rises above the houses. A
    greyish white sky is above.</p>

    <p>It is a small picture, and the artist was looking down on
    the scene. The subject is almost the same as that of the big J.
    Maris, &ldquo;Amsterdam,&rdquo; which you probably know; but
    this is talent and the other, genius.</p>

    <p>I have copied a few more things for you which I will send
    when I have a chance.</p>

    <p>Don't forget &ldquo;La Falaise&rdquo; and anything else you
    may happen to think of. That Victor Hugo is splendid. &Agrave;
    Dieu; my love to Father if you see him.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
