    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I want to be sure you hear from me soon after your arrival
    at The Hague.<label content="Theo.work"> I am eager to hear what your first impressions
    were of your new position and home. I heard that Mr. Schmidt
    gave you such a beautiful souvenir. That proves you have been
    very satisfactory in every respect. I am glad that we now work
    in the same house of Goupil.</label> Lately we have had many pictures
    and drawings here; we sold a great many, but not enough yet -
    it must become something more established and solid. I think
    there is still much work to do in England, but it will not be
    successful at once. Of course, the first thing necessary is to
    have good pictures, and that will be very difficult. Well, we
    must take things as they are and make the best of it.</p>

    <p>How is business in Holland? Here the ordinary engravings
    after Brochard do not sell at all, the good burin engravings
    sell pretty well. From the &ldquo;Venus Anadyomene&rdquo; after
    Ingres we have already sold twenty &eacute;preuves d'artiste.
    It is a pleasure to see how well the photographs sell,
    especially the coloured ones, and there is a big profit in
    them. We sell the Mus&eacute;e Goupil &amp; Co. photographs
    only en papillottes, on an average of a hundred a day.</p>

    <p>I think you will like the work at the house at The Hague as
    soon as you have got used to it. I am sure you will like your
    home with the Roos family. Walk as much as your time will
    allow. Give my best love to everybody at Roos's.</p>

    <p>You must write me sometime whom you like best among the
    older painters as well as among the moderns. Don't forget, as I
    am curious to know. Go to the museum as often as you can; it is
    a good thing to know the old painters also. If you have the
    chance, read about art, especially art magazines, Gazette des
    Beaux-Arts, etc. As soon as I have the opportunity, I will send
    you a book by Burger about the museums at The Hague and
    Amsterdam. Please send it back when you have read it.</p>

    <p>Ask Iterson to write me when he has time, and especially to
    send me a list of the painters who have won awards at the Paris
    exhibition. Is Somerwill still in the office or did he leave
    when you arrived?</p>

    <p>I am all right. I have a pleasant home, and although the
    house here is not so interesting as the one in The Hague, it is
    perhaps well that I am here. Later on, especially when the sale
    of pictures grows more important, I shall perhaps be of use.
    And then, I cannot tell you how interesting it is to see London
    and English business and the way of life, which differs so much
    from ours.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.homesick">You must have had
    pleasant days at home; how I should like to see them all again.</label>
    Give my compliments to everybody who
    inquires after me, especially at Tersteeg's, Haanebeek, Auntie
    Fie, Stockum and Roos; and tell Betsy Tersteeg something about
    me when you see her. And now, boy, good luck to you, write to
    me soon.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Do you have my room at Roos's or the one you slept in last
    summer?</p>
