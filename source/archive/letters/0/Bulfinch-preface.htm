    <p>PREFACE</p>

    <p>&ldquo;It would be really a remarkable book if one could see
    how much he (Vincent) has thought, and how he remained
    himself&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Letter of Theo to his mother, September 8, 1890</p>

    <p>When as Theo's young wife I entered in April, 1889, our flat
    in the Cit&eacute; Pigalle in Paris, I found in the bottom of a
    small desk a drawer full of letters from Vincent, and week
    after week I saw the soon familiar yellow envelopes with the
    characteristic handwriting increase in number.</p>

    <p>After Vincent's death Theo discussed with me the project of
    publishing these letters, but death took him away ere he could
    begin to execute this plan.</p>

    <p>Nearly twenty-four years passed after Theo's death before I
    was able to complete their publication.</p>

    <p>Much time was necessary to decipher the letters and to
    arrange them; this was the more difficult because often the
    dates failed, and much careful thought was needed before these
    letters were fitted into their place.</p>

    <p>There was another reason, however, which kept me from making
    them known earlier. It would have been an injustice to Vincent
    to create interest in his personality ere the work to which he
    gave his life was recognized and appreciated as it
    deserved.</p>

    <p>Many years passed before Vincent was recognized as a great
    painter. Now it is time his personality was known and
    understood.</p>

    <p>May the letters be read with consideration.</p>

    <p>Amsterdam, January 1914.</p>
