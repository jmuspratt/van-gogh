  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>As you can see, I am writing you from Brussels. I thought it
    better to change my domicile for the present. And that for more
    than one reason.</p>

    <p>In the first place, it was urgently necessary because the
    little room where I lived - which you saw last year - was so
    narrow and the light so bad that it was very inconvenient to
    draw there. It is true that if I could have had another room in
    that house, I would have stayed; but the people of the house
    wanted that room for their cooking and washing, and I could not
    have had it even if I had paid more. It is true that in spite
    of everything I drew Les Exercices au fusain and Les
    mod&egrave;les d'apres la bosse de Bargue [Plaster-cast Models
    by Bargue] there - either in the little room or outside in the
    garden; but now that I am as far as the portraits after Holbein
    in the third part of the Cours de Dessin, it has become
    impossible.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">That is why I moved, and in order to remedy things somewhat
    radically, this is the plan which I have begun to carry out. I
    went to see Mr. Schmidt here in Brussels and told him about the
    affair, that is, I asked him if he could help me make an
    arrangement with some artist so that I could continue my study
    in a good studio. For I feel that it is absolutely necessary to
    have good things to look at and also to see artists at work.
    Then I am more aware of what I lack, and at the same time I
    learn how to do better.</label></p>

    <p>It had already been a long time since I have seen enough
    pictures or drawings etc., and the very sight of some good
    things here in Brussels has given me new inspiration and has
    strengthened my desire to make good things myself.</p>

    <p>If Mr. Schmidt would have the kindness to talk seriously
    about it to someone or other, I do not doubt that the thing
    could be satisfactorily arranged. He received me cordially, but
    still, if you yourself would put in a word or two in my behalf
    to recommend the thing to him, it would have more effect on him
    than I could make myself. It would be quite natural if he
    perhaps looked at me with some suspicion, because formerly I
    was with Goupil &amp; Co., left, and have now returned to the
    art field.</p>

    <p>So if you write him by return mail, you would render me a
    great service, and it would prevent my losing time.</p>

    <p>I immediately took up my work here, namely the third part of
    Bargue, and I have a much better room here in a little hotel on
    the Bd. Du Midi than the small cabinet I used to have.</p>

    <p>Father wrote me that for the present I may count on
    receiving 60 fr. a month through his intermediary. There are
    several young men who are beginning to study drawing and are in
    the same position of not being rich either. The thing that
    gives one strength in such circumstances is not to be always
    alone, but to be in contact and relation with others in the
    same position. So you see, this is my great desire - that
    through Mr. Schmidt I may have some chance to make the
    acquaintance of some of the young artists here. Will you do
    what I ask you to that effect, that is, write a little note to
    Mr. Schmidt?</p>

    <p>I have made another pen drawing after &ldquo;The
    Woodcutter&rdquo; by Millet (the woodcut that you sent me). I
    think pen drawing is a good preparation, in case one should
    later want to learn etching. The pen is also very useful in
    accentuating pencil drawings, but one does not succeed in it at
    once. As to the drawing after &ldquo;Le Buisson&rdquo; by
    Ruysdael, I will work with the pen on it especially, and
    prepare myself by using it on other drawings. Among others, I
    have made one of the head of Dante which looks somewhat like an
    etching. But it is not as easy as it seems.</p>

    <p>In our interview Mr. Schmidt spoke about my entering
    L'&Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts here, but I told him frankly that
    I thought in my particular case it would be much better to work
    with some artist - especially since I have already finished two
    series of the Bargues and am on the third, which I could
    perhaps complete with the charcoal drawings by Allong&eacute;.
    However, I have not quite dismissed the idea of L'&Eacute;cole
    des Beaux Arts; I might go there in the evening while I'm here
    if it is free or not too expensive.</p>

    <p>But for the moment my aim must be to learn to make some
    drawings that are presentable and saleable as soon as possible,
    so that I can begin to earn something directly through my work.
    Because that is the necessity which is forced upon me. If you
    write me, please address your letters care of Mr. Schmidt, for
    I do not know whether or not I shall stay at this hotel any
    longer. I think you will approve of what I say, for to
    progress, it is necessary to continue with vigour.</p>

    <p>Once having mastered my pencil, or watercolouring, or
    etching, I can go back to the country of the mines or weavers
    and work from life better than I can now; but first I must
    learn more of the technique.</p>

    <p>Well, I shall finish this letter, hoping you will approve of
    what I have said.</p>

    <p><label subject="health.general">I think that lodgings and perhaps food somewhat better than
    that of the Borinage will also help to set me right again. For
    I have undergone some misery in the Belgian &ldquo;Black
    Country,&rdquo; and my health has not been very good lately.
    But if I can only succeed someday in learning to draw well what
    I want to express, I shall forget all that and remember the
    good side of things, which also exists if one looks for it. But
    still I must try to regain some strength, for I need all my
    energy.</label></p>

    <p>With a handshake,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
