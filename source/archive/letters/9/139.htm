    <p><i>Mon tr&egrave;s cher,</i></p>

    <p>As I have not heard from you for so long - meaning, not for
    several months - nor even had the slightest answer to my last
    letter, perhaps it will not be out of place to ask you for some
    sign of life.</p>

    <p>I must say it seems rather strange and rather unaccountable
    that you have not written me since the one letter I received on
    my arrival here. Not to write is good, but to write seasonably
    is not bad either; in some cases it is even much better.</p>

    <p>In thinking of you, I unconsciously said to myself, Why
    doesn't he write? If he is afraid of compromising himself in
    the eyes of Messrs. Goupil &amp; Co. by keeping in touch with
    me - is his position with those gentlemen so shaky and unstable
    that he is obliged to be so careful? Or is it that he is afraid
    I will ask him for money? But if this was the reason for your
    silence, you might at least have waited until I tried to
    squeeze something out of you, as the saying goes.</p>

    <p>However, I will not prolong this letter unnecessarily by
    enumerating a lot of things which occasionally pass through my
    head when I think of the reasons you may have had for not
    writing.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">I have been drawing all winter until now, and I have also
    read a great deal, for indirectly that is very necessary to me.
    On the whole I can say I have made progress, but I ought to be
    able to get along more quickly. The principal motive for
    writing you now is to ask you if you know of any reason why I
    should not go to see Mr. Tersteeg and Mauve. I think it would
    be to my advantage to go to The Hague for a time. But if I knew
    for certain that Mr. Tersteeg would rather I did not go there,
    it might make me change my mind. What do you think about
    it?</label></p>

    <p>I have seen little of Van Rappard, because it seemed to me
    that he did not like to be disturbed. As long as I am not more
    advanced, I must avoid young artists, who do not always reflect
    on what they do or say. And yet I long very much to find one
    who, being more advanced than I, could help me progress.</p>

    <p>Well, tell me if you see any insurmountable obstacle to my
    going to The Hague for a while, and if perhaps you know any
    other course, in case I am prevented from going there.</p>

    <p>I shake hands, awaiting a somewhat quicker reply,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
