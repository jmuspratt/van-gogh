    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Our Uncle Vincent visited us here, I saw him often and
    talked about a heap of things with him. I asked him if he saw
    any chance of getting you a place in the store in Paris.</p>

    <p>At first he wouldn't hear of it, saying that you were too
    valuable in The Hague. Then, after I insisted, he said he would
    think about it.</p>

    <p>He will certainly come to see you while he is in The Hague;
    he is not going to change from his dullness, let him say what
    he wants, it will do no harm to you, and won't do you any harm
    when you need something in the future. Don't talk of me unless
    you need something.</p>

    <p>He is very, very clever. When I was here last winter, one of
    the things he said to me was, &ldquo;Supernatural things I may
    not know, but I know everything about natural things.&rdquo; I
    do not know if those were his exact words, but that was the
    meaning.</p>

    <p>I can also tell you that one of his favourite pictures is
    &ldquo;Lost Illusions&rdquo; by Gleyre.</p>

    <p>Sainte-Beuve said, &ldquo;In most men there exists a poet
    who died young, whom the man survived.&rdquo; And Musset said,
    &ldquo;Know that often a dormant poet is hidden within us,
    always young and alive.&rdquo; I think Uncle Vincent belongs to
    the first group. So you know whom you are dealing with. Ask him
    squarely if he can arrange for you to have authority here or in
    London.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your letter that came this morning and the
    poem by R&uuml;ckert. Do you have a copy of his poems? I would
    love to get to know them. As soon as I have a chance, I shall
    send you a French Bible, and The Imitation of Christ. It was
    probably the favourite book of that lady painted by Ph. de
    Champaigne. There is a portrait of her daughter, a nun, in The
    Louvre, also by Ph. de Ch. She has l'Imitation on the chair
    beside her.</p>

    <p>Father wrote to me once: &ldquo;You know that the same mouth
    which said: &ldquo;Be as harmless as the doves,&rdquo; and
    straight away added: &ldquo;and wise as a serpent.&rdquo;
    [Matt. 10:16] Keep that in mind and believe me always,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Do you have the photographs after Meissonier in the gallery?
    Look at them often; he has painted men. Probably you know his
    &ldquo;Le Fumeur &agrave; la Fen&ecirc;tre&rdquo; and &ldquo;Le
    jeune Homme D&eacute;jeunant.&rdquo;</p>
