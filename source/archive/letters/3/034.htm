  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for your last letter and the poem by
    R&uuml;ckert.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday, I again went to hear M. Bercier. He had chosen
    this text: &ldquo;Il ne vous est pas permis&rdquo; [It is not
    permitted] and he concluded with &ldquo;Heureaux ceux pour qui
    la vie a toutes ses &eacute;pines&rdquo; [Happy is he whose
    life is all thorns]</p>

    <p>I know that uncle Vincent really likes this phrase,
    &ldquo;Young man, rejoice in your youth and that your heart is
    made content by the days of your youth, and live like your
    heart guides itself according to your eyes, but understand that
    for everything God will make judgment. Take away the chagrin of
    your heart, and put away malice, for youth and adolescence is
    not in vain. But remember your Creator during the days of your
    youth, before the bad days come and the years arrive when you
    will say `I don't have any pleasure'.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>For me, I find the following phrase better:</p>

    <p>Fear God and keep his commandments, for this will give
    pleasure for all men, and lead us not into temptation, but
    deliver us from evil.</p>

    <p>Enclosed is a note for Mr. Tersteeg. It is to ask him if he
    will have two engravings framed for me, &ldquo;Good
    Friday&rdquo; and &ldquo;St. Augustine.&rdquo; You will find
    them in the next box I send you. And will you be so kind as to
    have them sent to Helvoirt by September 10? I should like it to
    be a present [for his mother's birthday] from both of us, so
    will you pay 2.50 towards the frames? I told Mr. Tersteeg that
    you would write me how much it cost and that I would then remit
    the money to him; the 2.50 you can give me when we meet. That
    will probably be before Christmas; I think it would be better
    not to ask for leave before that time.</p>

    <p>Tonight I am invited to dine at Mr. Hamman's <sup>1</sup>.
    &Agrave; Dieu, write me soon and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your affectionate brother, Vincent</p>
