    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Congratulations to you on Father's birthday. That was a
    beautiful text from you on the 8<sup>th</sup> February:
    &ldquo;Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do
    it.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>We ignore what is ahead for our father and for us, but we
    can leave that to Him whose name is &ldquo;Our Father&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;I am that I am&rdquo;.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">Today, I received a reply from one of my letters; they asked
    if I am capable of teaching French, German and drawing, and
    also asked for my photograph. I answered today; as soon as I
    hear from them again, I will let you know.</label></p>

    <p>Thanks for the little book by Andersen, I am glad to have
    it. It is to be read aloud to a Dutchman, a fellow employee
    whom I have seen much of lately.</p>

    <p>Yesterday, I went to an Anglican church; I was very happy to
    assist again in an Anglican service, it is very simple and very
    beautiful. The sermon was on the theme of &ldquo;The Lord is my
    Shepherd, I shall not want.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Many thanks again for the book by Andersen, a handshake and
    compliments to Roos. I heard from home that Mr. Tersteeg has
    been at Etten. Ever yours, in haste,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
