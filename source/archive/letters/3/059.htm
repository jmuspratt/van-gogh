    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">On the morning before I left Paris, I received a letter from
    a schoolmaster in Ramsgate. He proposed that I go there for a
    month (without salary). At the end of that time he will decide
    whether I am fit for the position. You can imagine how happy I
    am to have found something! I will have in any event board and
    lodging free.</label></p>

    <p>Yesterday I went with Father to Brussels; we found Uncle
    Hein in a very sad state. On the train Father and I spoke much
    about pictures, including the Rembrandts at the Louvre and the
    portrait of &ldquo;Burgomaster Six&rdquo; and particularly
    about Michel.</p>

    <p>Wouldn't there be a chance for Father to see that book about
    Michel? If the opportunity arises, don't forget it.</p>

    <p>I am very happy to have the chance to see you before I
    leave, and Liesbeth too.</p>

    <p>As you know, Ramsgate is a little town by the sea. I saw
    somewhere that there were 12,000 inhabitants, but I don't know
    any more about it.</p>

    <p>And now till Saturday, a good journey to you. Always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Gladwell saw me off at the station last Friday night. On my
    birthday he came at half-past six in the morning and brought me
    a beautiful etching after Chauvel, an autumn landscape with a
    herd of sheep on a sandy road.</p>
