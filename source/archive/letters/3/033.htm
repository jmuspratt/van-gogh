    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I wanted to write you earlier. I am happy that Father has
    accepted the nomination at Etten; in the circumstances, I think
    it right that W. and A. [their sisters] are leaving together. I
    would have liked to be with you all that Sunday when you went
    to Helvoirt - did I write you that I spent the day with Soek
    and his family at Ville d'Avray? I was surprised to find three
    pictures by Corot in a little church there.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday and the previous Sunday, I went to church to
    listen to Dr. Bercier; I heard him preach on &ldquo;Toutes
    choses prouveront le bien de ceux qui aiment Dieu&rdquo; [All
    things work together for the good of those that love God] and
    on &ldquo;Il fit l'homme &agrave; son image&rdquo; [God created
    man in his own image.] It was beautiful and noble.</p>

    <p>You should go to church every Sunday if you have the time;
    even if the preaching is not good, it is better to go; you will
    not regret it. Have you been to church to hear the Reverend Mr.
    Zubli?</p>

    <p>On the list of engravings that hang in my room, I forgot the
    following:</p>

    <table width="47.72%" border="1" cols="2" rows="5">
      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="White" width="28.72%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p>N. Maes</p>
        </td>

        <td bgcolor="White" width="71.28%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p>The Nativity</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="White" width="28.72%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p>Hamon</p>
        </td>

        <td bgcolor="White" width="71.28%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p>&ldquo;If I Were the Sombre Winter&rdquo;</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="White" width="28.72%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p>Fran&ccedil;ois</p>
        </td>

        <td bgcolor="White" width="71.28%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p>Last Summer Days</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="White" width="28.72%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p>Ruyperez</p>
        </td>

        <td bgcolor="White" width="71.28%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p>The Imitation of Jesus Christ</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td bgcolor="White" width="28.72%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p>Bosboom</p>
        </td>

        <td bgcolor="White" width="71.28%" rowspan="1" colspan="1">
          <p>Cantabimus and Psallemus</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>I am trying to get another engraving of Rembrandt's
    &ldquo;Bible Reading&rdquo; for you; if possible, I will send
    it to you in the first box of pictures. Did I send you a
    lithograph of Troyon's &ldquo;Morning Effects&rdquo; and
    Fran&ccedil;ois' &ldquo;Last Summer Days&rdquo;? If not, tell
    me. I have duplicate copies of them.</p>

    <p>And now, be as happy as you can; do well and don't look back
    if you can help it.</p>

    <p>Believe me, always your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>My compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Tersteeg and Mauve. Also to
    the Van Stockums, Haanebeeks, Aunt Fie and the Rooses!</p>
