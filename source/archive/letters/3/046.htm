    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>A few words in a hurry, because tomorrow is St. Nicholas
    Day. It is such a pleasant day in Holland, I should like to
    celebrate it once more.</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">I am looking forward to Christmas, aren't you? We shall have
    a great many things to talk about. It is a pity that Anna
    cannot come too; I hope she also will have pleasant days.
    Christmas in England is very interesting, and perhaps Anna will
    learn to love her surroundings better if she celebrates the
    holiday there and helps to make things pleasant in the
    house.</label></p>

    <p>My dear Englishman (Gladwell is his name) is also going home
    for a few days. You can imagine how he longs to go; he has
    never been away from home before.</p>

    <p>Write to me soon.</p>

    <p>Is it as cold in Holland as it is here? With our little
    stove, Gladwell and I are very comfortable - morning and
    evening.</p>

    <p>I have taken to smoking a pipe again and I enjoy it as of
    old. Compliments to everybody who may ask about me. A warm
    handshake from</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
  </body>
