    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Fl&uuml;gel, Fl&uuml;gel &uuml;ber's Leben!</p>

    <p>Fl&uuml;gel &uuml;ber Grab und Tod!</p>

    <p>[Wings, wings to fly above life!</p>

    <p>Wings to fly above the grave and death!]</p>

    <p><label content="feelings.ambition">That is what we want, and I am beginning to understand that
    we can get them. Don't you think Father has them? And you know
    how he got them? By prayer and the fruit of prayer - patience
    and faith - and from the Bible that was a light on his path and
    a lamp ahead of his feet.</label></p>

    <p>This morning I heard a beautiful sermon on the theme: Forget
    what is behind you; the preacher said for example: Have more
    hope than memories; what there has been seriousness and blessed
    in your past life is not lost; wait no longer therefore, you
    will find it elsewhere, but advance &hellip; All these things
    have become new in Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>Keep heart and believe me,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>If it was true that youth and adolescence are only vanity -
    of course, if one takes into account what is written above and
    if one dreams that a well employed youth is a treasure,
    although he breaks off and resumes later, we would have to
    strive and hope to become men like our father and others. We
    hope on these two, and pray. Compliments to all that may ask
    after me.</p>

    <p>You know the etching by Rembrandt, &ldquo;Burgomaster
    Six,&rdquo; standing reading before the window? I know that
    Uncle Vincent and Uncle Cor are very fond of it, and I
    sometimes think they must have resembled him when they were
    younger. You also know the portrait of Six when he was older. I
    think there is an engraving of it in the gallery at The Hague.
    His life must have been beautiful and serious.</p>
