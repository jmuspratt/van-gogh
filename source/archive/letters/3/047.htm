    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.health">This morning I heard from home what had happened to you,
    <sup>1</sup> and I wanted to write you at once. </label>I wish I could
    do something for you; one of these days a box will be sent to
    The Hague, I will put some chocolate in it for you. Gladwell
    calls that &ldquo;consolation.&rdquo; I will also send you the
    book by Jules Breton - at least, if I can get it back, as I
    lent it to somebody. I am anxious to know how you are; write
    soon and please give me some details about how you spend your
    days.</p>

    <p>How I should like to be with you, Theo, but what can we do?
    It cannot be helped, boy. In a fortnight I shall go home and
    then we will certainly see each other, and our meeting again
    will not be the less delightful for the accident that has
    befallen you.</p>

    <p>If you see Uncle Jan, please remember me to him and thank
    him for his letter. You must try to become good friends with
    him. I don't know him well, but I know he is &ldquo;pure
    gold.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>It has been very cold. Fortunately, the thaw set in
    yesterday. I was very glad of it.</p>

    <p>I am rather busy these days with the inventory and finishing
    things off before my departure.</p>

    <p>And now, Theo, a warm handshake and wishing you a speedy
    recovery, always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
