  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Thanks for the letter I received this morning. Yesterday I
    saw the Corot exhibition. In it was the picture, &ldquo;The
    Garden of Olives&rdquo;; I am glad he painted that. To the
    right, a group of olive trees, dark against the glimmering blue
    sky; in the background, hills covered with shrubs and a few
    large ivy-grown trees over which the evening star shines.</p>

    <p>At the Salon there are three very fine Corots; the best of
    them, painted shortly before his death, &ldquo;Les
    B&ucirc;cheronnes&rdquo; [female woodcutters], will probably be
    reproduced as a woodcut in L'Illustration or Le Monde
    Illustre.</p>

    <p>Of course I have also been to the Louvre and the Luxembourg.
    The Ruysdaels at the Louvre are splendid, especially &ldquo;Le
    Buisson,&rdquo; &ldquo;L'Estacade,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Le Coup de
    Soleil.&rdquo; I wish you could see the little Rembrandts
    there,<art id=emmaus> &ldquo;The Men of Emmaus&rdquo;</art> and its counterpart,
    &ldquo;The Philosophers.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Some time ago I saw Jules Breton with his wife and two
    daughters. His figure reminded me of J. Maris, but he had dark
    hair. As soon as there is an opportunity I will send you a book
    of his, Les Champs et la Mer, which contains all his poems. He
    has a beautiful picture at the Salon, &ldquo;St. John's
    Eve.&rdquo; Peasant girls dancing on a summer evening around a
    St. John's fire; in the background, the village with a church
    and the moon over it.</p>

    <p>Dansez, dansez, oh jeunes filles,</p>

    <p>En chantant vos chansons d'amour,</p>

    <p>Demain pour courir aux faucilles,</p>

    <p>Vous sortiez au petit jour.</p>

    <p>There are now three pictures of his at the Luxembourg:
    &ldquo;A Procession among the Cornfields,&rdquo; &ldquo;Women
    Gleaning&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alone.&rdquo; &Agrave; Dieu.</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>
