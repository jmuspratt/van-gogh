  <body>
    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>I am enclosing my letter for Mother's birthday; please
    include it with yours.</p>

    <p><label content="art.influences">I have bought the book about Michel, with etchings after his
    pictures; as soon as I have finished it, I will send it to you.
    Yet Michel is not nearly so beautiful as the landscape
    described in Adam Bede which impressed us both so much. There
    is also a painting by Bonington which is almost
    &ldquo;<i>it</i>&rdquo; but not quite.</label> When you have a chance
    and I have finished the book, please lend it, in my name, to
    Uncle Cor; but I want it to be yours. I see the pictures
    themselves, so you may as well have the descriptions and
    etchings after them.</p>

    <p>Compliments to the Haanebeeks, Carbentuses, Van Stockums,
    Mauve, and Roos when you see them.</p>

    <p>Best wishes, always your loving brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Also give the book by Michel to Mr. Tersteeg to read.</p>
  </body>
