    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Enclosed is a note for Uncle Haanebeek; I had not written
    since Annette's death and felt a strong urge to do this. Do you
    call on them now and then? At all events you will take this
    note yourself, won't you?</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">Every morning my dear
    Englishman prepares oatmeal, his
    father sent him 25 pounds of it. I wish you could taste it with
    us.</label></p>

    <p>I am so glad that I met this boy. I have learned from him,
    and in return I was able to show him a danger which was
    threatening him.</p>

    <p>He had never been away from home, and though he did not show
    it, he had an unhealthy (though noble) longing for his father
    and his home. It was the kind of longing that belongs only to
    God and heaven. This idolatry is not love. He who loves his
    parents must follow their footsteps in life. He understands
    this now clearly; and though his heart is sad, he has the
    courage and the desire to go forward.</p>

    <p>Has Father already told you, as he often did me, 'Keep your
    heart with all diligence, because the heart is an open door to
    life'? Then let us do so, and with the help of God, we will
    stay on the right path.</p>

    <p>Good luck to you, believe me always,</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
  </body>
