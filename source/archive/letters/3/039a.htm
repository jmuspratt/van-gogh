    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>Boy, be careful, do not lose your resistance.</p>

    <p>See things as they are, and do not approve of everything for
    yourself. It is possible to deviate, to the right as well as to
    the left.</p>

    <p>Think of what Pa has undoubtedly said more than once to you,
    too; The <i>intellect</i> and the feeling must go hand in
    hand.</p>

    <p>Cordial greetings, and always,</p>

    <p>Your affectionate brother, Vincent</p>

    <p>Write again soon.</p>

    <p>I advised you to go out a good deal, but if you don't like
    to, don't do it.</p>

    <p><label content="lifestyle.reclusive">You know I used not to go out so much myself, which
    occasioned unpleasant remarks many a time.</label></p>

    <p><label content="feelings.nostalgia">How I should like it if we could have breakfast together or
    drink a cup of chocolate in my room. Keep courage, old
    fellow.</label></p>

    <p>Don't take things that don't really concern you very closely
    <i>too</i> much to heart, and don't let them hit you too
    hard.</p>

    <p><label content="food-and-drink.preference">How about eating bread, have you tried that?</label> In a great
    hurry I shake your hand warmly in thought.</p>
  </body>
