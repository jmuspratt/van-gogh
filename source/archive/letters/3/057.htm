    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>At last I am sending Longfellow's poems; I am sure the book
    will become a friend to you.</p>

    <p>Today I answered two advertisements again. I continue to do
    it, though I get hardly any answers. My time here is drawing to
    a close.</p>

    <p>You will see many beautiful things on your travels. Though
    love of nature is not <i>everything</i>, it is still a precious
    possession; may we keep it always.</p>

    <p>And now you will become a guest in &ldquo;many an Inn&rdquo;
    - that is pleasant, too, sometimes. You know, I once made a
    trip on foot to Brighton; I always remember it with pleasure.
    The inns in England are often so cosy. Longfellow describes it
    so well in Tales of a Wayside Inn.</p>

    <p>Gladwell has got my place at the gallery and is there
    already to become familiar with the work before I leave. I have
    seen several pictures intended for the Salon, including two
    beautiful large Gabriels: &ldquo;A Morning in the
    Meadows&rdquo; (through the haze one sees a town in the
    distance) and one of what we should call a &ldquo;watery
    sun.&rdquo; There were also two large Xavier de Cocks. One
    represents an evening at the beginning of summer, with a meadow
    surrounded by poplars; in the distance, the farm and fields and
    a girl driving the cows home. In the foreground a pool, around
    which three cows are lying in the grass - one white, one black
    and one red; the sun has set and the trees stand out dark
    against the light yellowish sky.</p>

    <p>I am writing in great haste, as you can see from the
    handwriting. A pleasant journey; always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
