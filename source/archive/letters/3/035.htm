    <p>Paris, 1<sup>st</sup> September 1875</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p><label content="">This morning I received from Father and from you the news of
    the death of Uncle Jan <sup>1</sup>. News of this sort makes
    one repeat the prayer, &ldquo;Unite us, O Lord, close together,
    and may our love of Thee strengthen that bond,&rdquo; and
    again: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the
    whole duty of man.</label></p>

    <p>In the first box of pictures going to Holland you will find
    some lithographs and the engravings after Rembrandt that I
    mentioned to you. You will surely like the two lithographs
    after Bonington. At the same time I shall send you a few
    photographs of pictures by Jules Breton and Corot for Father; I
    shall write on the back, &ldquo;for Helvoirt.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>I never heard of the painter, Pynas, whom you write about. I
    should like to see the picture you mention. I don't know that
    lithograph after Diaz's &ldquo;A Monk&rdquo; either.</p>

    <p>Last Sunday I was at the Louvre (on Sundays I generally go
    there or to the Luxembourg). I wish you could see Van Ostade,
    his own family - himself, his wife and, I think, eight
    children. They are all in black - the wife and daughters with
    white caps and kerchiefs - in a stately old-Dutch room with a
    fireplace, large oak panels and ceiling, the whitewashed walls
    with pictures in black frames. In the corner of the room is a
    large bed with blue curtains and quilt.</p>

    <p>The <art id=emmaus>Rembrandt, &ldquo;The Men of Emmaus,&rdquo;</art> which I
    wrote you about has been engraved; Messrs. Goupil &amp; Co.
    will publish the engraving next autumn.</p>

    <p>Do you ever visit Borchers's home? His mother is, I think, a
    real lady. Go out as much as you can, I mean, of course, to Van
    Stockum's, Haanebeek's, Carbentus's, Borchers's, etc.; not to
    Kraft's or Marda's, you know, unless it happens that you can't
    do otherwise - then there is no harm in it for once.</p>

    <p><label content="Theo.work">How is business? I know how difficult it is sometimes, but
    try to be as useful as you can.</label></p>

    <p>Best wishes and write soon, always your loving brother,</p>

    <p>Vincent</p>

    <p>Enclosed is a note for Borchers; compliments to all the Roos
    family and to everybody who asks after me. B. tells me that
    Weehuizen is dead, which I did not know. Were you there?</p>
