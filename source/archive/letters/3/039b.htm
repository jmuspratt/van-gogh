    <p>Paris, 27 September 1875</p>

    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>&ldquo;The Kingdom of God cometh not with observation; the
    kingdom of God is within you.&rdquo; &ldquo;The son of Man is
    not come to be served, but to serve,&rdquo; and we who want to
    become His followers, Christians, we are not greater than our
    Lord [see Like 22:26-27; John 13:16]. Blessed are the poor in
    spirit, blessed are the pure in heart.</p>

    <p>Narrow is the path which leadeth unto life, and those that
    find it are few. Struggle to enter by the narrow gate, for many
    will seek to enter, and will not be able [see Matt. 7:14].</p>

    <p>My brother, let us be prudent; let us ask of Him Who is on
    high, Who also prayeth for us, that He take us not away from
    the world, but that he preserve us from evil. Yea, let us be
    sober, and watch, let us trust in God, and not lean upon our
    intellect. Let us ask of Him that He force us to come in; that
    He enable us to fulfill a Christian's life; that He teach us to
    deny ourselves, to take our cross every day and follow after
    Him; to be gentle, long-suffering and lowly of heart.</p>

    <p>A part that shall not be taken away, a spring of living
    water, springing into Life eternal [see Luke 10:42; John 4:13],
    these are the good gifts that the Hearer of prayers, the Giver
    of all perfect gifts, will give unto those that pray for them
    unto Him.</p>

    <p>And over and above this the assurance that there is &ldquo;a
    Father's house in which are many mansions,&rdquo; and that,
    when He that hath gone and prepared a place for us, He will
    receive us all unto Himself. And for our comfort in life, on
    the road to that &ldquo;Father's house,&rdquo; the Comforter,
    the Spirit of Truth, who shall lead us in truth [see John
    14:2-6, 16-17].</p>

    <p>Yet a Christian's life has its dark side too, it is
    principally man's work.</p>

    <p>For those that walk with God, God's friends, God's pious
    ones, those who worship him in the Spirit and in Truth, are
    tried and purified, and often have received from God a thorn in
    the flesh; blessed shall we be, if we can repeat after our
    father, Paul: &ldquo;When I was a child, I spake as a child, I
    understood as a child, but now that I have become a man, I have
    put away childish things, and am I become, and God hath made me
    sorrowful yet always rejoicing.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Write soon and give my regards to all acquaintances, and
    believe me</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
