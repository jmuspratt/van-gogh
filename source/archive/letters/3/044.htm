    <p>Dear Theo,</p>

    <p>It is again time for you to hear from me, but it will only
    be a short note today; I have not much time, as I am very
    busy.</p>

    <p>Thanks for what you sent me; I am very glad to have it.</p>

    <p>I am glad for our parent's sake as well as for yours that
    you were at Etten on the day of the ordination. You must tell
    me all about it.</p>

    <p>Uncle Vincent and Aunt left again yesterday. I saw quite a
    bit of them. To my great regret I did not see them off at the
    station when they left; enclosed is a note for Uncle, telling
    him how it happened.</p>

    <p>We are in autumn, I suppose you go for walks often. Do you
    rise early? Me, I rise regularly at a good hour, it is an
    excellent habit to get into; the new day is so delicious, I
    have learnt to like it. Most of the time, I go to bed at an
    equally good hour. <label content="food-and-drink.preference">Every
    morning my worthy Englishman prepares
    oatmeal - how I wish you could be here some morning.</label></p>

    <p>I shall write more soon. Write again soon and about
    everything. With a firm handshake, I am always</p>

    <p>Your loving brother, Vincent</p>
