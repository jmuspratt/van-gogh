    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>7 January 1875</p>

    <p>I am glad she [Anna] is still together with Vincent.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>We are still enjoying the memories of those nice days
    together. Those were very good days that we won't forget
    easily, and Vincent being with us that cold evening, and Anna's
    nice letter arriving when we were all sitting together around
    the stove.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>1 February 1875</p>

    <p>Together with Vincent she had seen Hamlet there and seems to
    have well enjoyed it all.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>11 February 1875</p>

    <p>She [Anna] is happy and feels well placed, she likes her
    work and gets satisfaction out of it. She is really becoming a
    very capable person and she blesses the opportunity of being
    surrounded by such beautiful nature; she says it gives her
    courage and force to work and struggle on, and serenity and
    peace in the heart.</p>

    <p>Anna van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>28 April 1875</p>

    <p><label content="attitude.people">Do you sometimes hear from Vincent? I never do. It seems to
    me he has illusions about people and judges them before he
    knows them, and then, when he finds out how they really are and
    that they don't come up to the expectations he had formed
    <i>too soon</i> about them, he is so disappointed that he
    throws them away like a bouquet of wilted flowers without
    looking whether among those wilted flowers there would not be
    some that are not &ldquo;quite rubbish&rdquo; if only they
    would be treated with some care.</label> I am really sorry I went to
    stay with him during the school holidays and was a burden to
    him. If I would have had any reason to foresee that that would
    be the case I certainly would have found some way to arrange
    things differently. I did not tell this to the people at home;
    they think he is a great support to me and that seems to give
    Father and Mother a great sense of relief. Well, the sun shines
    into my little room too beautifully and joyfully to think about
    unpleasant things and still less to write about them; if,
    however, you know why he is like that to me, I should be very
    glad if you would tell me.</p>

    <p>Lies to Theo</p>

    <p>30 May 1875</p>

    <p>Oh, if only Anna wanted to, how much she would be able to do
    for him. I don't understand she has changed so much; I used to
    think she loved him so much.</p>

    <p>I have never had the opportunity of really getting to know
    Vincent well, but during that holiday and at that moment I
    realized what he is and what it meant to have such a brother.
    Theo, I for one, I think we should be proud of him and should
    follow his example instead of going against him. If only Father
    could hear but once how he talked to us then and could realize
    the purity of his thoughts, how differently he would think of
    him.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>9 July 1875</p>

    <p>If with regard to Vincent, we sometimes were worried about
    something strange in him, this does not mean - you do know
    that, don't you? - that we overlooked all the good qualities he
    has.</p>

    <p>There is a kind of naturalness that is blamable. Someone who
    yields to low passions, follows <i>nature</i>, that is to say
    bestial nature, but <i>human nature</i> teaches him to dominate
    those passions.</p>

    <p>Now don't misunderstand me; I don't want to say that I
    suspect you or Vincent of yielding to those ignoble passions,
    no indeed!</p>

    <p>But this is the course of my reasoning: a person can
    sometimes be <i>not natural enough</i>. Youth is allowed to be
    lively, gay, cheerful; a youthful person is allowed to enjoy
    meeting people who are also youthful, gay and cheerful. In
    those years it is even a good thing if one doesn't go against
    one's nature, for there is in a cheerful mood a beneficial
    force. Melancholy can be harmful, and to indulge in melancholy
    does not help to produce energy.</p>

    <p>My dear Theo! You should really think about that; I see that
    recently your liveliness has diminished, your cheerfulness is
    no longer what it was before.</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo.</p>

    <p>11 August 1875</p>

    <p>The time is near that Anna and Willemien are going to leave
    us.</p>

    <p>[They both went to Welwyn, in England.]</p>

    <p>Reverend van Gogh to Theo</p>

    <p>31 December 1875</p>

    <p>How Vincent is going to go on, we don't know yet - he
    certainly is <i>not</i> happy. I believe it is not the right
    place for him there. We talked quite openly and discussed
    possibilities. Yesterday he went to Uncle Cor to consult him
    too; he is also a businessman. I tend to believe that I must
    advise Vincent to ask for his resignation in two or three
    months. (I tell you this <i>confidentially</i>!) Don't think I
    act hastily; I have noticed the signs of the times, seriously
    noticed them! In the meantime, these are only deliberations; it
    is not a definite decision. We also keep an eye on God in this
    matter. May His light give us wisdom and courage to act, when
    we see it necessary [&hellip;] There is so much good in
    Vincent. That is why it may be necessary to make a change in
    his position.</p>
